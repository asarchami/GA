1,"  By Andrea Shalal-EsaWASHINGTON Jan 24 The U.S. Navy on Friday said it was sticking with Raytheon Co as prime contractor for next-generation radar-jamming technology seen valued at billions of dollars in coming years, despite a November ruling by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) that upheld a protest against the award.Raytheon in July beat out BAE Systems and a team comprised of Northrop Grumman Corp and Exelis Inc  to win the Navy contract for the jamming system.  The GAO in November backed a BAE challenge of the contract, which was initially valued at $279 million but could be worth many multiples of that over coming decades, according to analysts""The Navy has completed corrective action as recommended by the GAO in the sustained protest filed by BAE Systems on the Next Generation Jammer Technology Development contract,"" said Navy spokeswoman Commander Thurraya Kent.She said the Navy decided to stick with the Raytheon offer after carrying out a new cost and technical analysis of all three original bids, but gave no additional details. The new jammer will replace the Northrop-built ALQ-99 tactical jamming system now used on the EA-18G Growler aircraft built by Boeing Co. The jamming pods will enable U.S. aircraft to render enemy radars useless.""This confirms a huge breakthrough for Raytheon that potentially could generate over $10 billion in additional revenue during the next several decades,"" said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute think tank.Thompson said he expected the program to survive the current difficult budget environment given the U.S. military's need in wartime to prevent adversaries from tracking aircraft, communicating with ground forces or remotely detonating bombs. It was not immediately clear if BAE or Northrop would protest the Navy's decision to keep Raytheon on the contract.No immediate comment was available from Raytheon. BAE spokeswoman Kristin Gossel said her company was weighing its options.""We protested the award based on concerns with the Navy's evaluation of our offering and our protest was sustained by the GAO. We are disappointed with today's decision and are currently considering all of our options,"" Gossel said.Northrop, which had not protested the Navy's award to Raytheon, said it was also disappointed by the decision.""While we are disappointed, we remain committed to continue to provide our warfighters with the lowest risk, most affordable solutions,"" said Northrop spokesman Randy Belote.When the GAO, the congressional agency that oversees federal contract protests, ruled in favor of BAE in November, it said the Navy had failed to reasonably evaluate the risk of the proposals, improperly credited Raytheon with outdated performance data, and did not adequately document its decision.",2014-01-24,RTN,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 4:32pm EST",UPDATE 2-Raytheon to keep next-generation jammer contract -U.S. Navy,http://www.reuters.com//article/raytheon-navy-idUSL2N0KY1HW20140124?type=companyNews

3,"  By Andrea Shalal-EsaWASHINGTON Jan 30 U.S. arms maker Raytheon Co  reported higher-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter on Thursday, although revenues fell short of estimates with U.S. military spending in decline.The company expected sales to drop further in 2014, but it said operating margins, international sales and profits would remain strong, buoyed partly by a sharp rise in pension income.Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Dave Wajsgras said the low point or ""bottom"" of U.S. military spending was likely from mid-2013 to mid-2014, echoing similar projections from top executives at Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, which reported earnings last week.He said a two-year budget agreement reached by Congress last year would help the U.S. government and arms makers plan better for the coming year.Raytheon said revenues were expected to drop to $22.5 billion to $23 billion in 2014 after falling 2.9 percent to $23.7 billion in 2013.Earnings from continuing operations were expected to rise to $6.74 to $6.89 per share, from $5.96 in 2013, boosted by a sharp rise in income from pension investments. Excluding pensions, earnings per share were likely to drop to $5.76 to $5.91 per share from $6.38 in 2013, the company said.Wajsgras told Reuters the company's bookings exceeded sales by 28 percent in the fourth quarter, and that trend was likely to continue in the first half of 2014, with sales likely to show stronger growth in the second half. Raytheon now expects to finalize a large order from Kuwait for a Patriot missile defense system in February, a deal valued at $500 million to $600 million that had been expected in the fourth quarter, Wajsgras said.In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Raytheon shares were 25 cents higher, at $88.88.STRONG BALANCE SHEET  Chief Executive William Swanson, who will hand over the reins to Chief Operating Officer Tom Kennedy at the end of March, said Raytheon also expected to finalize a Patriot order valued at over $2 billion with Qatar in the first half of 2014.He told analysts international bookings would account for 35 percent to 40 percent of total orders in 2014, down from 43 percent in 2013, while foreign sales would account for about 30 percent of total sales, up slightly from 29 percent in 2013.Swanson said sales were expected to remain strong in the Middle East and Asia, but there could also be new orders from Europe and Australia in two or three years.Wajsgras said the company's adjusted operating margin in 2013 was 13.4 pct, the highest level seen since 2000, which reflected efforts to cut costs by consolidating facilities and other measures. He said margins would likely ease to 12.6-12.8 percent in 2014 as the company began work on several new programs, which typically carry lower margins to start. Wajsgras said strong 2013 margins were a highlight of the year. ""That bodes well for our customers because it reflects our ability to continue to take costs out,"" he said.Swanson said Raytheon's strong balance sheet put it in a good position for possible acquisitions of low- and mid-tier companies that are being squeezed by cuts in military spending. But he said the company was not looking to simply buy revenue.""Just to buy something for revenue sake, that never works,"" Swanson said. ""But where it fits in, especially where we see future growth, then that would be the case.""Raytheon reported nearly flat net profit from continuing operations of $467 million, while earnings per share from continuing operations rose to $1.46 from $1.41 a year earlier.

""This should more than offset any worries about reduced bookings, as the timing of awards is notoriously lumpy and difficult to predict,"" he said.Wajsgras said the company was investing heavily in research and development, noting that past investments had helped the company win big U.S. Navy contracts -- for a next-generation electronic jammer and a next-generation radar -- in 2013.",2014-01-30,RTN,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 10:27am EST","UPDATE 2-Raytheon Q4 earnings beat estimates, foreign sales strong",http://www.reuters.com//article/raytheon-results-idUSL2N0L40S320140130?type=companyNews

17,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Missile Defense Agency on Tuesday mapped out plans to overhaul the ground-based U.S. missile defense system managed by Boeing Co and improve its reliability after several test failures in recent years.Missile Defense Agency Director Vice Admiral James Syring said the government was requesting about $300 million in fiscal 2015 to redesign the Raytheon Co ""kill vehicle"" that hits and destroys an enemy missile on contact, add a new long-range radar, and fund other measures to helping the system better identify, track and destroy potential enemy missiles.The agency's budget request, which must still be approved by Congress, also funds longer-term initiatives to improve the system a decade after what were essentially prototypes to be rushed into operational use.Overall, the budget requests $8.5 billion for missile defense, including about $7.5 billion for the Missile Defense Agency. Missile defense is one of the biggest items in the Pentagon's annual budget, although Republicans have faulted the Obama administration for scaling back funding in recent years.Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the budget, which was shaped by a major review of defense strategy, underscored the continued importance of missile defense, along with space, cyber and special operations, giving rapidly emerging threats.Syring said the Bush administration's decision to deploy the fledgling missile defense system in 2004 was aimed at countering ""a very real threat,"" but it cut short systems engineering and testing of the system. A slower process would have avoided some of the problems seen now, he said. Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall told a conference last week that the reviews of the program had revealed ""bad engineering"" on the current system.Syring said reforms were needed now, especially given Hagel's decision to add 14 more interceptors to the 30 in place in California and Alaska.""The final step now is to step back ... to now look at this from a bottoms-up design standpoint and not just keep making reliability improvements ... on the margin,"" Syring said.He said the goal was to deploy a redesigned kill vehicle, new long-range radar and other measures by 2020. The Pentagon said the new kill vehicle would be built with a modular, open architecture and designed with common interfaces to make upgrades easier, and help broaden the vendor and supplier base. Syring said decisions would be made soon on how to proceed with the redesign of the kill vehicle, factoring in schedule, cost and price. He did not rule out a competition despite the tight schedule of buying 14 new interceptors by 2017.""I would not shy away from competition if that was the right answer,"" Syring told reporters. He said the acquisition plan would help inform plans for buying the new interceptors, something now due to begin in fiscal 2016.The government's funding of early design work on a new common kill vehicle by Raytheon, Boeing and Lockheed Martin Corp meant the agency could choose from three ""viable industry concepts,"" he said. The fiscal 2015 budget also continues to fund that work, Syring said, noting that the effort was aimed at developing a kill vehicle that could be used on a ground-based interceptor, a Standard-Missile-3 or some future system.Syring said a review of a July 5 intercept failure was ongoing but officials were nearing an understanding of the root cause. It was not an issue involving simple quality problems, he said.

Boeing confirmed that the announcement included a contract to buy 24 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and three Boeing 737 Airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft.The deal for the helicopters was valued at 8.9 billion riyals, said the spokeswoman for the conference.In Paris, France's Defense Ministry said Qatar had agreed to buy 22 NH90 military helicopters from a unit of European aerospace group Airbus worth 2 billion euros ($2.76 billion) and two Airbus-made refueling tankers. NHIndustries is 62.5 percent owned by Airbus' Eurocopter helicopter unit, 32 percent owned by AgustaWestland, a unit of Italy Finmeccanica's and 5.5 percent by Stork Fokker.Qatar also committed to buy a Patriot missile defense system built by Raytheon equipped with PAC-3 missiles made by Lockheed; advanced daytime, high-definition sensors and radars for Apache helicopters; and Javelin missiles built by a Lockheed-Raytheon joint venture, according to sources familiar with the matter.Raytheon had told analysts in January that it expected to finalize an order with Qatar in the first half of 2014 for over $2 billion in Patriot missile defense system equipment.The Pentagon approved the sale to Qatar of $9.9 billion worth of Patriot fire units, radars, and various Raytheon and Lockheed missiles in November 2012. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the U.S. body which oversees foreign arms sales, had notified lawmakers in July 2012 of a possible sale of Apache helicopters to Qatar.A spokeswoman for the U.S. agency had no immediate comment.Washington has been keen to deepen its cooperation with Gulf nations, which have been long-standing allies, on missile defense and increase pressure on Iran over its nuclear program.The Apache helicopters are built by Boeing and used by the U.S. Army, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and United Kingdom.They will be fitted with Longbow radar equipment made by a joint venture of Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corp.($1 = 3.6415 Qatar Riyals)   (Additional reporting by Marine Pennetier in Paris and Andrea Shalal in Washington, Editing by William Maclean, Elaine Hardcastle and Tom Brown)",2014-03-27,RTN,"Thu Mar 27, 2014 | 4:08pm EDT","UPDATE 2-Qatar buys helicopters, missiles in $23 bln arms deals",http://www.reuters.com//article/qatar-defence-idUSL5N0MO3VV20140327?type=companyNews
20,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON An unmanned U.S. Navy helicopter built by Northrop Grumman Corp and a precision ship-landing system built by Raytheon Co face mandatory reviews that could lead to their cancellation after quantity reductions drove unit costs sharply higher in 2013, the Pentagon announced on Thursday.Senior defense officials said the cost increases were largely due to cuts in the numbers of items to be purchased, but federal law required a careful look at program performance and other factors.The Nunn-McCurdy law requires a mandatory, 60-day live-or-die review if weapons systems see an increase of more than 25 percent in their unit costs. In order for programs to survive, top defense officials must certify that the program is needed for national security and meets other conditions.In this case, senior defense officials suggested that both programs would likely survive since the cost spikes were due to reduced orders, but they said final decisions would not be made until the reviews were completed on June 17.The Defense Department's annual ""selected acquisition report"" on the cost of major weapons showed a slight 0.3 percent, or $4.4 billion, drop in the combined cost of 77 programs for a total cost of $1.62 trillion.The reduction was largely due to reduced quantities, changes in inflation rates, and reduced needs for support equipment, although they were partially offset by schedule delays and cost increases in other programs, including Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 fighter jet, the report showed.Senior defense officials said budget-driven reductions in arms programs had less effect on the program costs in 2013 than expected, although unit costs were likely to edge higher in coming years as mandatory spending reductions took effect. ""I just don't think we're out of the woods yet,"" said one official who was not authorized to speak publicly. ""There will be effects on programs as budgets hold or come down further.""The Navy is buying 49 fewer Northrop Fire Scout helicopters after switching to a larger aircraft built by Bell Helicopter, a unit of Textron Inc, that can carry more than twice the fuel or cargo and can stay in the air for 12 hours. That compares to nearly five hours for the previous aircraft, which is no longer being produced.Northrop Chief Executive Wes Bush said the program was going very well and the unit cost increase was due to the reduction in quantity. He said the Navy remained committed to the program and he expected it to survive the review now under way. The cut in quantities of Raytheon's Joint Precision Approach and Landing System (JPALS) came after the Army and Air Force decided to pull out of the joint program, which resulted in the need for 10 fewer shore-based training systems, the report said.The cost increase in the JPALS program also was partly due to an extension in the development program aimed at increasing the capability of the system, and higher material costs.Two other programs showed cost increases of more than 15 percent, requiring notification to Congress, but not triggering the more arduous cancellation reviews, the report showed.Boeing Co's upgrade of the U.S. E-3 Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) saw a 19 percent jump in average unit procurement costs, mainly due to a reduction of seven airplanes, but also due to schedule changes, the report said. The cost of General Dynamics Corp's Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) to build handheld and other smaller radios, rose 19 percent due to a revised acquisition strategy, it said.Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet saw a $7.4 billion increase in acquisition costs to $398.6 billion, largely due to postponed orders from the U.S. military and international partners. The report showed a decrease of nearly 9 percent, or $97 billion, in the estimated cost of operating the F-35 aircraft through 2065.The Pentagon report estimated the total ""lifecycle"" cost of the U.S. F-35 fleet at $1.02 trillion, down from $1.11 trillion a year earlier, but the F-35 program office said improving reliability and other adjustments meant the number would be closer to $917 billion.Other changes included a $2.2 billion, or 4.2 percent, drop in the cost of Boeing's KC-46A refueling plane, and a 9.5 percent rise in Boeing's program to remanufacture AH-64 Apache helicopters, due to higher labor and material costs.The projected cost of the Navy's Littoral Combat Ship program dropped over 33 percent, or $11.3 billion, due to the Pentagon's decision to halt orders after 32 ships instead of buying all 52 that had been planned.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Eric Beech and Bill Trott)",2014-04-17,RTN,"Thu Apr 17, 2014 | 7:29pm EDT",Two U.S. arms programs face live-or-die reviews after costs jump,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-military-arms-idUSBREA3G2II20140417?type=companyNews

23,"  (Adds CEO comments from earnings call, updates stock price)By Andrea ShalalApril 24 U.S. weapons maker Raytheon Co  reported higher first-quarter profit on Thursday after a tax credit and favorable pension adjustments and forecast strong bookings and a slight gain in margins for the rest of the year.But the company, which makes missiles and other military equipment, did not change its full-year forecast, which drove down shares more than 4 percent. Other defense stocks were more modestly lower.Raytheon said net income attributable to shareholders rose to $596 million, or $1.89 per share, from $488 million, or $1.49 a share, a year earlier. Excluding the tax and pension impact, earnings dropped to $1.43 per share from $1.56.Raytheon Chief Financial Officer David Wajsgras told Reuters the company expected strong bookings and improved operating margins for the rest of this year after posting the highest quarterly earnings per share and cash flow in over a decade.Cash flow reached $659 million in the first quarter, up from $422 million a year earlier. The company expects full-year cash flow to reach $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. Wajsgras said the company's international demand remained strong, and that foreign orders would account for nearly 30 percent of revenues and nearly 40 percent of bookings in 2014.Revenues fell 6.3 percent to $5.5 billion in the first quarter, a reflection of U.S. budget cuts, but Raytheon programs fared well in the 2015 U.S. budget proposal, Wajsgras said.Sales and operating income were down at three of Raytheon's four business divisions. Operating profit at its information and services unit rose 1 percent despite a 5 percent drop in sales. The company still expected revenue to reach $22.5 billion to $23 billion for the full year, with earnings of $6.74 to $6.89 per share, or $5.76 to $5.91, excluding special items.Wajsgras said first-quarter bookings rose to $4.3 billion from $3.6 billion a year earlier due to a missile defense order from Kuwait and a cybersecurity order from an unnamed country. Bookings would likely top $7 billion in the second quarter.The company expected a slight improvement in operating margin over the course of the year, after the measure reached 14.3 percent in the first quarter, he said. Raytheon reported an operating margin of 12.4 percent for the 2013 year, up 20 basis points from the previous year.Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kennedy told analysts the company viewed acquisitions as a critical part of its long-term growth strategy, with a particular eye to expanding international and commercial sales in the cyber security area.Kennedy said tensions between Russia and Ukraine have boosted demand for Raytheon's products in eastern Europe, and should firm up Poland's plans for a competition over a missile defense contract.Byron Callan, an analyst with Capital Alpha Securities, said Raytheon's results were largely in line with those of other defense companies, adding that the stock drop was likely because it did not increase its full-year earnings forecast.Raytheon shares fell 4.5 percent to $95.73 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange.

Wajsgras told Reuters that the company's international demand remained strong, and that foreign orders would account for nearly 30 percent of revenues and nearly 40 percent of bookings in 2014.Revenues fell 6.3 percent to $5.5 billion in the first quarter, a reflection of U.S. budget cuts, but Raytheon programs fared well in the 2015 U.S. budget proposal, Wajsgras said.Sales and operating income were down at three of its four business divisions, but its intelligence, information and services unit showed a 1 percent increase in operating income despite a 5 percent drop in sales. The company still expected revenue to reach $22.5 billion to $23 billion for the full year, with earnings of $6.74 to $6.89 per share, or $5.76 to $5.91, excluding special items.Wajsgras said first-quarter bookings rose to $4.3 billion from $3.6 billion a year earlier due to a large missile defense order from Kuwait and a big cybersecurity order from an undisclosed country. Bookings were expected to top $7 billion in the second quarter, he said.The company expected a slight improvement in operating margin over the course of the year, after the measure reached 14.3 percent in the first quarter, he said. Raytheon reported an operating margin of 12.4 percent for the 2013 year, up 20 basis points from the previous year.Rob Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said Raytheon's decision to leave its full-year outlook unchanged could disappoint investors.To further lower costs, Raytheon plans to remove 10 percent of its global real estate square footage over the next three to four years, beginning with a reduction of about 2 percent in 2014, Wajsgras said. He said 3 percent had already been removed.He said the company was also continuing to whittle down the number of suppliers to lower costs and improve quality.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Jeffrey Benkoe)",2014-04-24,RTN,"Thu Apr 24, 2014 | 9:11am EDT","Raytheon posts higher profit, forecasts strong bookings",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-raytheon-results-idUSBREA3N17420140424?type=companyNews

30,"  * Pentagon chief Hagel visits Mideast ally next week* Israel says austerity drive hurts combat readinessBy Dan WilliamsJERUSALEM, May 9 Budget-strapped Israel is pressing the United States to conclude a deal extending defence aid beyond 2017, when Washington's current $3 billion annual payouts to its Middle East ally expire, officials said on Friday.They said a swift agreement on future U.S. grants would help Israel's military draft a five-year austerity plan accommodating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative government.""It's difficult to budget into 2018 and 2019 without knowing what funds will be available,"" an Israeli defence official said.U.S. Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel will visit Israel next week and the future aid will probably be raised by his hosts, according to a different official who declined to be identified by name or nationality. The previous Republican administration signed a 10-year deal with Israel in 2007 granting it $30 billion, most of it going on American defence products.U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, has sparred with Netanyahu over Iran's nuclear programme and peacemaking with the Palestinians. But support for Israel's security remains strong in Washington - even as policymakers there slash spending on a range of U.S. military programmes.""Our two nations are forever bound by our shared history and our shared values, and every American dollar spent on Israel's security is an investment in protecting the many interests that our nations share,"" U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Friday, concluding three days of consultations in Israel.Israel's Defence Ministry and the U.S. embassy in Israel declined comment on the aid negotiations, which are under way. INCREASED FUNDING SOUGHT A U.S. official briefed on the talks and who spoke on condition of anonymity said Israel was seeking an overall increase to between $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion a year, while the Obama administration had spoken of $2.8 billion. The allies would probably settle on $3 billion ""or thereabouts,"" the official predicted, adding that Israel ""wants to get this worked out as soon as possible"".Israel's defence budget of around $14.5 billion has been challenged by Finance Ministry demands to cut $870 million. Netanyahu's security cabinet in December separately approved a $930 million boost to the defence budget, but the military says it needs more to contend with proliferating regional threats.""We cannot bridge this budget rift,"" Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israeli lawmakers on Wednesday. ""There has been a mortal blow to training, to readiness and to fitness.""A senior Israeli military officer said the belt-tightening had put the brakes on David's Sling, a missile interceptor  developed jointly with U.S. firm Raytheon Co. and which is being considered for purchase by Poland as it accelerates its defence preparations in response to the Ukraine-Russia standoff.David's Sling could be operational in Israel in a year, the officer told reporters on Thursday - but only if more funds were found. ""The moment you don't have the money, you pull back on the development and on getting the kit in the field,"" he said.In addition to the annual defence grants, Washington has separately helped bankroll Iron Dome, a shorter-range Israeli rocket interceptor system already deployed. Rice put the amount of U.S. funds earmarked for Iron Dome at nearly $900 million.

The new program will allow the Air Force to sharply increase its ability to track ""space junk"" and other smaller objects in space. Currently the Air Force tracks about 23,000 of an estimated 500,000 objects in space, but the new program would allow it to track hundreds of thousands of additional objects. Teague said the new radar system would give the Air Force far greater insight into what is going on in low earth orbit and over the southern hemisphere. Current plans call for the new system to be based on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 2,100 miles southwest of Honolulu, and to start operating in September 2018.

37,"   By Andrea Shalal | COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.  COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. May 23 The U.S. government's growing acceptance of commercial military satellites is opening the $20 billion-a-year market to new companies and forcing big arms makers such as Lockheed Martin  and Boeing to change how they operate.U.S. officials are trying to boost security of U.S. military and intelligence satellites, with an eye on risks from space debris and the proliferation of space-faring countries that could target U.S. satellites in a war.Officials hope the booming commercial satellite market can help the government obtain simpler and cheaper satellites, lower the cost of launching and create more options in other areas.After years of talk, U.S. budget cuts and changes in technology have started to alter a market long dominated by big contractors like Lockheed.""The space market is changing dramatically,"" said Henry Obering, senior vice president with Booz Allen Hamilton and former Missile Defense Agency director. ""The big companies will either adopt new ways of doing things or they will fail."" ""Change always creates angst,"" said Doug Loverro, deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy. He said market giants were more open to commercial practices, cutting costs, speeding up programs and testing new technologies.For instance, he said the Air Force cut the cost of a new ground-based radar for tracking space objects by two thirds by mandating prototypes and manufacturing demonstrations. A contract award to Lockheed or Raytheon Co is expected soon.Lockheed, Boeing and others are embracing new production processes such as 3D printing, and hunting down commercial orders to offset an expected slowdown in U.S. government buying. Loverro said the Pentagon was still expected to spend about $300 billion on military space programs over the next 15 years, but buying practices will change to make satellites more ""resilient."" ""Do we continue to buy what we've been used to buying, or do we move in a different direction?"" he said. He cited widespread agreement that the Air Force should stop buying Boeing-built Wideband Global System satellites since commercial satellites now carry more bandwidth.The Air Force is studying ways to use commercial bandwidth, beyond leasing services as it does during military operations.That could create opportunities for satellite operators like Iridium Communications, which plans to launch 66 new satellites starting in 2017 that will host payloads for the government or other customers.James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, said 90 percent of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's underlying intelligence now comes from companies like DigitalGlobe Inc. But he said companies should not rely on the government to underwrite new satellite programs.U.S. officials said they welcome competition in the rocket launch market. But new players such as Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, have complained that change is slow in coming and say the United States risks being overtaken by other countries.

39,"  (Adds official announcement by Pentagon, reaction from Raytheon)WASHINGTON, June 2 The Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, has won a $915 million contract to develop a ground-based radar for tracking objects in space for the U.S. Air Force, beating out a bid from Raytheon Co .The fixed-price contract, which includes an incentive fee, was announced late on Monday by the Pentagon in its daily digest of major contract awards. U.S. military officials have underscored the importance of the Air Force's Space Fence program, given the growing number of countries operating satellites in space, China's work on anti-satellite weapons, and the huge amount of debris in orbit. The new program will allow the Air Force to increase sharply its ability to track ""space junk"" and other smaller objects in space. Currently the Air Force tracks about 23,000 of an estimated 500,000 objects in space, but the new program would allow it to track hundreds of thousands of additional objects. Plans call for the new system to be based on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 2,100 miles southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii, and to start operating in September 2018.Raytheon said it had been notified about the Air Force's decision, but said it would be inappropriate to comment further until after it receives a post-decision debrief from Air Force officials. A company spokesman declined comment on whether the company would protest the decision.

41,"  (Adds Lockheed comment, byline)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 2 Lockheed Martin Corp  on Monday beat out Raytheon Co to win a $915 million contract from the U.S. Air Force for a ground-based radar that will track about 200,000 pieces of old satellites and other objects in space.The Pentagon announced the fixed-price contract for the new ""Space Fence,"" which includes an incentive fee, late on Monday in its daily digest of major contract awards.The deal covers development and construction of the new radar on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 2,100 miles (3,400 km) southwest of Honolulu, with initial operations to start in late 2018.The deal also includes an option for a second site in western Australia, said Steve Bruce, vice president for advanced systems at Lockheed's Mission Systems and Training Business. Bruce, speaking with reporters, declined to estimate the total value of the contract, including that option and others, but analysts said it would be worth just under $2 billion.U.S. officials have underscored the importance of the Space Fence program given the growing number of countries operating satellites in space, China's work on anti-satellite weapons, and the huge amount of debris in orbit around the earth.The program will increase the U.S. government's ability to track spent rocket boosters, dead satellites and other ""space junk"" that could damage satellites or the International Space Station, Bruce said. The Air Force now tracks about 23,000 of an estimated 500,000 objects orbiting the earth, but the new radar will increase that number tenfold.Brian Weeden, a former Air Force analyst who now works with the Secure World Foundation, said the new system still faced challenges, including the need for new computers to process the larger amount of data that will be collected. ""There's a lot that can still go wrong,"" he said. Raytheon said it had been notified about the Air Force's decision, but that it would be inappropriate to comment further until after it receives a post-decision debrief from Air Force officials. A company spokesman declined comment on whether it would protest the decision.Doug Loverro, deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy, told Reuters last month that the Air Force cut the projected cost of the new radar system by two-thirds by mandating prototypes and manufacturing demonstrations.Bruce said the Air Force scaled back its requirements as a result of studies conducted by Lockheed and other companies in the early stages of the procurement process, ultimately deciding to use space-based assets to track debris in higher orbits.""The Air Force did a terrific job of looking at these requirements and coming up with something that's affordable,"" he said.Bruce declined to provide Lockheed's expected profit on the deal, or other details of the contract terms, but said the fixed-price deal was unusual for a development project.

42,"  * Top weapons buyer says ""No silver bullet""* U.S. Navy names General Dynamics, Lockheed units ""superior suppliers""* Shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls fails to make U.S. Navy listBy Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 13 The U.S. Navy on Friday named units of top arms makers General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co as part of its list of the top-performing nine suppliers for 2014 based on their performance over the last three years.The Pentagon said on Friday it would use such public recognition of ""superior suppliers,"" incentives and competition as key tools in its ongoing drive to end years of cost overruns and schedule delays on key weapons programs. Top U.S. arms buyer Frank Kendall said the Navy developed the list as a pilot project this year, but he had asked the Air Force and Army to compile their own lists this year as part of the continuing effort to improve defense acquisition.""We want to recognize their performance, but we also want to motivate our performers who are not on that list to do better,"" Kendall told reporters as he released a second annual report on the Pentagon's procurement, development and operating budgets, which totalled over $350 billion in fiscal 2015 budget request.The nine companies also included units of General Electric , Northrop Grumman Corp, a venture of Lockheed and Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and Britain's Rolls Royce Holdings Plc. One notable exception was Huntington Ingalls Industries , one of the Navy's largest suppliers, and builder of aircraft carriers, submarines and other warships.Navy acquisition chief Sean Stackley said the suppliers that did make the list would be offered the chance to reduce certain contract requirements, including removal of some procedures, inspections or requirements, which could lead to cost savings.Kendall said the Pentagon had imposed affordability targets on 30 of its biggest programs and all but two or three were within those caps. But he said uncertainty about future budget levels continued to hamper more efficient investment decisions. He said the Pentagon remained focused on improving the way it buys hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons and services each year, but there was no single ""silver bullet"" to do that.Instead, he said the department needed to work on multiple fronts, including efforts to simplify the overlapping laws that govern defense acquisitions, better training for federal workers that administer contracts, and deeper analysis of past programs.""Defense acquisition is complicated and varying,"" he wrote in the 116-page report. ""We must empower, encourage and train our workforce to think - not dictate a cookbook that workforce members blindly follow.""The report cited good results from contracts with incentive fees, but said incentives were sometimes counterproductive and the Pentagon did not always use such measures as well as it could.Kendall also highlighted the importance of competition, but  said the department needed to get more creative about injecting competition into the process given declining defense budgets and growing consolidation in the industry.

45,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. missile defense system managed by Boeing Co on Sunday hit a simulated enemy missile over the Pacific in the first successful intercept test of the program since 2008, the U.S. Defense Department said.The successful intercept will help validate the troubled Boeing-run Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system which provides the sole U.S. defense against long-range ballistic missiles, and the Raytheon Co kill vehicle that separates from the rocket and hits an incoming warhead.    ""This is a very important step in our continuing efforts to improve and increase the reliability of our homeland ballistic missile defense system,"" said Missile Defense Agency (MDA)Director Vice Admiral James Syring.He said the agency would continue its ongoing drive to ensure that the ground-based interceptors and overall homeland defense system were effective and dependable.Reuters reported on Friday that the Pentagon is restructuring its $3.48 billion contract with Boeing for management of the missile defense system to put more emphasis on maintenance and reliability.Sunday's high-stakes test came after the system had failed to hit a dummy missile in five of eight previous tests since the Bush administration rushed to deploy the system in 2004 to counter growing threats by North Korea. Earlier this month, Syring said that another test failure would have forced the Pentagon to reassess its plans to add 14 more interceptors to the 30 already in silos in the ground in Alaska and California.During the test, a long-range ground-based interceptor launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, intercepted an intermediate-range ballistic missile target launched from the U.S. Army's Reagan Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Pentagon said.It said all components involved in the test appeared to have performed as designed. Program officials will spend the next several months assessing the performance of the system using telemetry and other data obtained during the test.The test marked the first successful intercept by Raytheon's Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle Capability Enhancement II, or EKV CE-II, which failed in both previous tests conducted in 2010.  The companies involved had no immediate comment.Ten of the interceptors now in place carry the kill vehicle used in Sunday's test. The other 20 carry an earlier kill vehicle that failed in a July 2013 test. Syring has said a fix will be implemented for that issue by year's end.Riki Ellison, founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, hailed the successful test as a big step forward for the troubled program, and said it would allow U.S. military commanders to reduce the number of interceptors that would be fired at an incoming ballistic missile. ""This success is a significant milestone ... that demonstrates the system's reliability and increases the confidence of the North American Combatant Commander ... responsible for the defense of the country,"" he said.Critics said the Raytheon kill vehicle had still only succeeded in one of three tries, and urged Congress to rethink plans to buy 14 more of the flawed interceptors at a cost of $75 million each, or just over $1 billion.""Would you spend $1 billion on an insurance policy that only worked one third of the time?"" said Tom Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association. ""We need to put the money into making the system better, not bigger.""Phil Coyle, former Pentagon chief tester and a longtime critic, called for accelerated work on a new design. ""We need to make sure we have a system that works, not expand a system we know to be deeply flawed,"" he said in a statement.

Raytheon is a subcontractor to Boeing Co on the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, which defends the United States against long-range ballistic missiles and is projected to cost a total of $41 billion. The system hit a simulated enemy missile on Sunday for the first time since 2008.Kremer said Raytheon had not been officially notified by the Missile Defense Agency about resuming production, but the test had clearly validated the revamped design of the kill vehicle, which separates from the ground-based interceptor and hits an incoming warhead. The Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle Capability Enhancement II, EKV CE-II, is already carried by 10 of the 30 U.S. interceptors already in silos in Alaska and California, but it had failed to hit its target in two previous flight tests in 2010.The earlier version of the kill vehicle, the CE-I, which is on the remaining 20 interceptors, failed its last intercept test in July 2013, but the government says it expects to correct the problem that caused that failure by year's end.Kremer said he was not aware of any plans to test the CE-1 kill vehicle. He said Raytheon is keen to compete for work on a new kill vehicle design that the agency has said it plans to pursue and field by 2017 or 2018.""This test ... does not negate the need to do a redesign to improve the overall reliability of the kill vehicle,"" Kremer said, adding that Raytheon would use its experience with the Standard Missile-3 to improve the GMD warhead's reliability. He said the kill vehicles in use now were designed to be autonomous, but technology advances since then would allow the new warhead to be more tightly integrated into the overall U.S. missile defense system.Reuters reported on Friday the Pentagon is restructuring its $3.48 billion contract with Boeing for management of the missile defense system to put more emphasis on maintenance and reliability.Kremer confirmed the report but declined comment on  negotiations between the government and Boeing, or the possible timing of a new agreement.""Clearly, in general, the wise thing to do is to write contracts in a manner that reflects the priorities of the government such that everybody is working toward the same goal, and I think that's what they're focused on,"" Kremer said.

48,"  * Bids from Lockheed Martin and Israel are dropped* Tender was revised after Russia intervened in Ukraine* Poland choosing operational systems over advanced technology   (Recasts, updates with statement from losing consortium)By Marcin GoettigWARSAW, June 30 Poland has short-listed a consortium of France's Thales and European group MBDA, as well as U.S. firm Raytheon, in its tender for a mid-range missile defence system, the defence ministry said on Monday.The bids that lost out on the tender, which is estimated to be worth about $5 billion, were from the Israeli government and the MEADS consortium led by Lockheed Martin.Poland, a NATO member since 1999, had accelerated the process to select a supplier for the missile system after Russia's intervention in Ukraine prompted fears among NATO members in eastern Europe they could be next in line. The Polish defence ministry also changed the criteria for the system, saying it should be already operational and in use by a NATO member state's armed forces.That ruled out the Lockheed Martin-led bid, which involved technology still in development, and the Israeli bid, called David's Sling, which is also not yet in operation.The ministry said terms of the tender will ensure the participation of Poland's domestic defence industry in the construction of the missile defence, with the state defence holding Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa playing a key role. Raytheon welcomed the announcement.""We are moving ahead to provide Poland with the most advanced air and missile defense system in use today by 12 countries around the world,"" said Dan Crowley, President, Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems.""And (we) look forward to partnering with the Polish industry to build the next generation Patriot system."" The first phase of the Polish system, know in Poland as Wisla, is for eight sets of mid-range interceptor rockets, which may later be supplemented by short-range ones.Poland has already passed legislation to secure funding for the system, the ministry said earlier this year.MEADS International issued a statement saying it was disappointed with Poland's announcement, but that it would keep working with existing national partners Germany and Italy to finish development of the system.""Today's announcement reflects new criteria for the Wisla selection, and should they change again, we stand ready with the most advanced air and missile defence system available today.""The planned system is separate from elements of a U.S. missile shield to be deployed in Poland by 2018, as confirmed by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on a visit to Warsaw this week.($1 = 3.0482 Polish Zlotys)    (Additional reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa in Washington; Editing by David Evans)",2014-06-30,RTN,"Mon Jun 30, 2014 | 2:39pm EDT","UPDATE 2-Poland short-lists Raytheon, Thales in missile system tender",http://www.reuters.com//article/poland-defence-idUSL6N0PB4WM20140630?type=companyNews

Every five percent is like a glass ceiling you have to break through,"" Kennedy said at the Farnborough air show. ""To do the next step you have to have boots on the ground.""

It remains in the running for a large missile defense competition underway in Turkey, which recently asked bidders to extend their offerings through Aug. 30.Kennedy said Raytheon was working with suppliers and cutting its own costs to ensure that it was able to maintain the pricing offered in its Patriot bid, and continued to work closely with the Turkish government on that offering.He said Raytheon already used suppliers to provide components for other weapons systems in Turkey, and had offered Turkey substantial co-production prospects if it won the bid. Turkey last year said it would negotiate with a Chinese firm for a new missile system, but later said it had not yet made a final decision after U.S. and NATO officials said the system would not be able to operate with NATO equipment.In addition to pressing for more foreign sales, Raytheon remains focused on cutting costs, consolidating facilities and making its operations more efficient as it grapples with mandatory budget cuts in the United States, Kennedy said.In the United States, Raytheon is awaiting details on how the Pentagon plans to upgrade the kill vehicles or warheads on ground-based interceptors used in its missile defense system. The U.S. military on June 22 carried out its first successful test since 2008 of the new kill vehicle that is used on 10 of 30 ground-based interceptors that have already been deployed. Twenty other interceptors carry an earlier version of the Raytheon warhead, which failed in an test one year ago.The Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, Frank Kendall, told reporters on Sunday he hoped to fund a much more reliable kill vehicle for the missile defense system run by Boeing Co, but said the acquisition approach would depend largely on cost. Kennedy said Raytheon believed it could help lower the cost of the kill vehicle and improve its reliability by drawing on its experience with the successful Standard Missile-3, but said it would wait to see the Pentagon's requirements.

Kennedy said Raytheon was working with suppliers and cutting its own costs to ensure that it was able to maintain the pricing offered in its Patriot bid, and continued to work closely with the Turkish government on that offering.He said Raytheon already used suppliers to provide components for other weapons systems in Turkey, and had offered Turkey substantial co-production prospects if it won the bid.Turkey last year said it would negotiate with a Chinese firm for a new missile system, but later said it had not yet made a final decision after U.S. and NATO officials said the system would not be able to operate with NATO equipment. In addition to pressing for more foreign sales, Raytheon remains focused on cutting costs, consolidating facilities and making its operations more efficient as it grapples with mandatory budget cuts in the United States, Kennedy said.In the United States, Raytheon is awaiting details on how the Pentagon plans to upgrade the kill vehicles or warheads on ground-based interceptors used in its missile defense system.The U.S. military on June 22 carried out its first successful test since 2008 of the new kill vehicle that is used on 10 of 30 ground-based interceptors that have already been deployed. Twenty other interceptors carry an earlier version of the Raytheon warhead, which failed in an test one year ago.The Pentagon's chief weapons buyer, Frank Kendall, told reporters on Sunday he hoped to fund a much more reliable kill vehicle for the missile defense system run by Boeing Co, but said the acquisition approach would depend largely on cost.Kennedy said Raytheon believed it could help lower the cost of the kill vehicle and improve its reliability by drawing on its experience with the successful Standard Missile-3, but said it would wait to see the Pentagon's requirements.

The CBOE market volatility index fell 5.7 percent to 15.71 in a sign of reduced investor uncertainty. Stocks have been under pressure of late as investors, worried about high valuations and uncertainty around the world, pulled back from riskier assets. Before Friday's rally, the S&P 500 had given up more than 4 percent while the small-cap Russell was down 7 percent over the past four weeks.Markets rallied after Russia's Defense Ministry said Friday it had finished military exercises in southern Russia, which the United States had criticized as a provocative step amid the Ukraine crisis.""The market hates uncertainty, and when it doesn't have enough information about how badly an event could impact the economy, it tends to take the worst-case scenario and people sell off,"" said Malcolm Polley, president and chief investment officer of Stewart Capital Advisors in Indiana, Pennsylvania. ""With the news of the de-escalating in Russia, and also with the administration saying exactly what they are doing in Iraq, it's helped clear up some uncertainty in the market.""Earlier on Friday, the United States carried out air strikes targeting Islamic State fighters marching on Iraq's Kurdish capital.

67,"  WARSAW, Sept 27 U.S. weapons maker Raytheon  has signed a letter of intent with Polish military software producer WB Electronics to cooperate in bidding for a contract to build Poland's planned anti-missile system, Polish state radio said on its website.Under the agreement, WB Electronics is to provide software for training and tactic simulations for the system, dubbed ""Shield of Poland"". The two companies would also cooperate in seeking export opportunities.WB was not immediately available for comment. Raytheon, which offers the Patriot missile defence system, is in the running to build Shield of Poland, competing with a consortium of Franco-Italian missile maker MBDA and France's Thales. The cost of the project is estimated at 26 billion zlotys ($7.9 billion).

68,"  WASHINGTON, Sept 30 U.S. defense contractor Raytheon Co on Tuesday said it had won a $149 million contract from Israel's Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd to provide key parts for the Tamir interceptor used in the Iron Dome missile defense system.The contract, which builds on a co-marketing agreement the two companies signed in 2011, calls for Raytheon to use its extensive supplier networks to provide a second source of essential components for the Tamir interceptor. The Iron Dome system is credited with over 1,000 successful intercepts.Details were finalized on Monday, Raytheon said. ""Iron Dome has proven itself time and again by protecting Israel's population from incoming rockets, artillery and mortars,"" Taylor Lawrence, president of Raytheon Missile Systems, said in a statement. ""The sourcing of Tamir interceptor components in the U.S. will go a long way to ensuring sufficient volumes of available Tamir missiles for Israel's defense."" The deal was negotiated under Raytheon's co-marketing agreement with Rafael, but stops short of a larger co-production deal that has been under discussion since U.S. lawmakers conditioned more than $680 million in earlier U.S. funding for Iron Dome on production of some components in the United States. Raytheon declined to comment further.Rafael CEO DiDi Yaari said the cooperation between the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and the Israeli Missile Defense Organization had been ""extraordinary"" and Israelis appreciated U.S. support for the system.

69,"  WASHINGTON Oct 1 The U.S. Air Force is close to announcing the winner of a three-way competition between Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Co and Northrop Grumman Corp to build the next generation of long-range radars, senior military officials said.""We're close. We're working our way through the approval process,"" Air Force Lieutenant General Ellen Pawlikowski, the service's top military acquisition official, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.One source familiar with the process said Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, had approved the Air Force's acquisition plan for the new radar late Tuesday, and a contract announcement was likely early next week.The announcement will mark the next phase of a program that initially began in 2009, with the Air Force funding work on full-scale prototypes by all three companies. The initial contract will fund continued development and low-rate production of a few radar systems, followed by orders for nearly 30 more. Industry executives also see potential opportunities for selling the system to U.S. allies.Kendall had told Reuters in an interview earlier Tuesday that he was ""not quite finished"" looking at the Air Force's business plan for the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar program, or 3DELLR, but an announcement could come soon. The new system will replace the Air Force's current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s. It will serve as the Air Force' primary long-range, ground-based sensors for detecting and tracking aircraft and missiles. In its request for proposals, the Air Force said it expected the new system to be more accurate, reliable and give air controllers a precise view of aircraft and missiles.Pawlikowski said the Air Force had applied some of the lessons it learned on other large-scale acquisition programs in structuring the next-generation radar program, including efforts to strictly rein in military requirements and funding work on prototypes before choosing a design.Executives at the three companies have been expecting a contract announcement for several weeks.

96,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The Pentagon on Thursday said it had ordered a review of  Raytheon Co's work on a new ground control system for Global Positioning System satellites after an Air Force-ordered restructuring drove the program's cost significantly higher.The current contract value is $1.6 billion, according to Air Force officials, which marks an increase of over 80 percent from the initial contract value of $886 million.Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, on Tuesday ordered a ""deep dive"" review, starting in January, of the next-generation GPS Operational Control System (OCX) that Raytheon is developing, according to his spokeswoman, Maureen Schumann.Kendall told an investor conference in New York on Tuesday that most U.S. weapons programs were within 2-3 percent of their cost targets, but he was keeping an eye on one program that was ""significantly over."" He did not name the program. Schumann told Reuters on Thursday that Kendall was referring to the Raytheon OCX program.The U.S. Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center awarded Raytheon a contract in February 2010 to develop the hardware and software needed to control U.S. GPS satellites and ensure the security of their signals, but the program has run into technical challenges and cost increases. Including options, the total contract was initially valued at $1.5 billion.The Air Force this summer restructured the OCX program, increasing the value of the base contract by 80.5 percent from $886 million to $1.6 billion, and delaying its completion by two years to 2018.  A spokeswoman for the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center confirmed the contract value was now $1.6 billion, and said it included options for further work. She did not spell out the percentage increase or the value of the options. Raytheon said it had worked closely with the Air Force to modify the cost and schedule baseline and incorporate new Department of Defense (DOD) cyber security requirements. ""The revised contract reflects the complexity of implementing the DOD's most rigorous cyber requirements coupled with improvements to our systems engineering and software development approach,"" Matt Gilligan, Raytheon's GPS-OCX program, said in a statement.Gilligan said the company had successfully completed four of five exercises to prove the system's readiness for launch, and is due to start formal qualification tests in early 2015.

Kendall said the cost growth on the program was due to both ""execution issues"" on the part of the contractor, and changes in requirements by the Air Force.He said he had spoken with Raytheon's management about the program, and the company had agreed to provide additional resources to ensure the program's success. He did not elaborate.

98,"  * Plan to get troubled $7 bln programme back on track* Project has been blighted by long delays and cost blowouts* Defence minister plans sovereign submarine building industry   (Adds more details on destroyer and submarine programmes)By Jane WardellSYDNEY, Dec 9 Defence contractors BAE Systems Plc, Navantia SA and Raytheon Co will increase their roles in Australia's A$8.5 billion ($7 billion) warship building project as the country tries to get the troubled programme back on track.Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said on Tuesday the trio's increased involvement will drive immediate improvements in shipbuilding performance, without giving any financial details of their expanded contracts.Australia's Air Warfare Destroyer project has been blighted by long delays and cost blowouts. An auditor's report earlier this year found that local shipyards were not fully prepared to take on the complex work, while Spain's Navantia provided poor blueprints marred by ""drawing errors or omissions"" and late changes.""The good news is we have turned a corner,"" Cormann told reporters. ""We're committed to stop the growing scheduling and cost overruns."" BAE, Navantia and Raytheon were chosen to increase their involvement after a competitive procurement process, Cormann said.Navantia will contribute design function skills, BAE will coordinate shipbuilding and Raytheon will offer management skills.Raytheon was already part of the programme's AWD Alliance, rounded out by government military purchaser Defence Materiel Organisation and government-owned shipbuilder Australian Submarine Corp (ASC). SUBMARINE SOVEREIGNTY Defence Minister David Johnston said the kickstart to the destroyer programme was the first step of a plan aimed at restoring the future of naval maritime capability in Australia, including the creation of a ""sovereign industry around submarines.""Johnston declined to comment when asked if that meant the country's next submarines would be built in Australia. The defence minister was forced to apologise last month after saying he would not trust ASC ""to build a canoe"", comments that fuelled expectations that most of the work in an A$40 billion programme will go offshore.Reuters reported in September that Australia was leaning toward buying as many as 12 off-the-shelf stealth submarines from Japan.Prime Minister Tony Abbott had previously pledged the submarines would be built in South Australia, where unemployment exceeds the national average, but his government began back-pedalling in July, signalling cost and schedule were paramount.Tuesday's announcement came as results from a by-election indicated that Abbott's Liberal Party may concede a majority government to the opposition Labor Party in South Australia.Johnston, who has faced increasing pressure to step down from his portfolio, said more detail on the defence programme would be provided in the government's Defence White Paper, due out next year.($1 = 1.2057 Australian dollars)   (Editing by Andre Grenon and Lisa Shumaker)",2014-12-08,RTN,"Mon Dec 8, 2014 | 5:50pm EST","UPDATE 1-BAE, Navantia, Raytheon to up role in Australian shipbuilding",http://www.reuters.com//article/australia-defense-idUSL3N0TS5DE20141208?type=companyNews

105,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force has agreed to reevaluate proposals received in a competition for a long-range radar system initially won by Raytheon Co (RTN.N), after two losing bidders filed protests, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The Air Force's action is expected to resolve the two separate protests, which were filed by Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) days after the contract was first awarded to Raytheon in October, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly.The decision followed a series of hearings held by the Government Accountability Office, the congressional agency that evaluates federal contract disputes.""The Air Force is taking corrective action,"" said one of the sources. The protesting companies were now evaluating the proposed actions to determine whether they would render their protests moot, the source added. Attorneys for the companies involved declined comment, as did spokesmen for the Air Force and the GAO.It was unclear how long the Air Force reevaluation of the bids would take, but one source said it could include a more technical assessment of proposals submitted by the companies. Raytheon in October beat out Northrop and Lockheed to develop a replacement for the Air Force's current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s. The new radar will serve as the Air Force's primary long-range, ground-based sensors for detecting and tracking aircraft and missiles. The value of the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) contract is limited now but could eventually rise to about $1 billion, given the Air Force's plan to buy 30 of the new systems in coming years. Orders from foreign militaries for as many as 100 of the new systems could further expand the value of the contract, one of few new large acquisition programs awarded by the Air Force.

110,"   By Andrea Shalal and Sagarika Jaisinghani  U.S. arms maker Raytheon Co (RTN.N) forecast 2015 revenue largely below average analyst expectations as orders fell, and said adjusted profit margins would drop further to just over 12 percent, sending its shares down as much as 6 percent.The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system on Thursday said it expected revenue to grow modestly in 2016, with further growth seen in subsequent years.Orders fell 5.4 percent to $7.11 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.But the company said it expected to finalize in the first quarter a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that was initially expected last year.U.S. arms makers have been hurt in recent years by the Pentagon's plan to cut $1 trillion in spending over a decade as required by a 2011 law.Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Dave Wajsgras told Reuters he expected low single-digit revenue growth in 2016, with acquisitions, foreign orders and increasing U.S. demand seen accelerating gains in subsequent years. Foreign orders would account for about 30 to 35 percent of bookings and 30 percent of overall revenue in 2015, he said.Wajsgras, who will head Raytheon's information systems business from March, said the company was investing in new technologies such as cybersecurity and electronic warfare to boost internal growth. More strategic acquisitions are also planned.Incoming CFO Toby O'Brien told analysts the company would continue to buy back shares and propose higher dividends. Last year, dividend payments rose 6 percent to $735 million, while share repurchases fell 30 percent to $750 million.Raytheon forecast earnings of $6.20-$6.35 per share from continuing operations and revenue of $22.3 billion to $22.8 billion for 2015. It expects to earn $5.49 to $5.64 per share, excluding items.

""It's our desire to get the best of all three, and that's what we intend to do,"" Syring said.The redesign effort is part of a broader effort led by Syring to improve the reliability of the existing fleet of ground-based interceptors after a series of test failures, quality problems and other issues in recent years.The agency conducted a successful intercept test in June for the first time since 2008. A non-intercept test was planned this year to evaluate alternative ""divert thruster"" to steer the interceptor, with the next intercept test slated a year later. Boeing runs the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system for the government, but the Missile Defense Agency will take over the effort to develop a new more reliable kill vehicle or warhead once its plan is approved. Syring said the Pentagon was ""very close"" to approving the plan.The agency requested $279 million as part of its overall $8.1 billion budget to continue design work on a new kill vehicle to improve reliability, availability and performance, and ensure the warheads were more producible. The agency's 2016 budget request also includes funding for a detailed look at the reliability and design characteristics of the current fleet of interceptors.Syring said the agency also planned to award a contract for development of a new long-range discriminating radar before the end of fiscal 2015. Bids are due in March, with Raytheon, Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corp  expected to bid.Syring said there was ""absolutely no presumed winner"" in that competition, which will result in a contract valued at nearly $1 billion.The Air Force initially chose Raytheon to develop a separate long-range radar but is now reevaluating bids received from all three firms after Lockheed and Northrop protested the initial decision.

123,"  (Adds Raytheon statement)By Wiktor SzaryWARSAW Feb 5 Poland may review its decision to drop Lockheed Martin Corp's MEADS system from its $5 billion missile defence tender, a senior source at the Polish Ministry of Defence said.The Polish programme is particularly significant for the defence sector given recent cuts to military spending. Poland plans to spend an estimated total of 130 billion zlotys ($36 billion) between 2013 and 2022 on modernising its armed forces.Last year, Poland excluded the Lockheed Martin-led consortium from the tender, short-listing two contenders: a consortium of European group MBDA and France's Thales SA , and U.S. firm Raytheon Co, as potential suppliers.This decision may now be reviewed, the source said, if Germany decides to implement MEADS. The Polish defence ministry, MEADS and Raytheon did not immediately reply to requests for comment. MBDA declined to comment. ""MEADS could still very well end up being on the table,"" the source said. ""We will consider allowing the MEADS system to take part in the tender, if Germany decides that it will be at the core of their missile defence.""""Formally, MEADS' participation in the Polish tender is still possible,"" the source added.Lockheed had no immediate comment on the news. Raytheon spokeswoman Kristin Hilf said the company had no indication that Poland had plans to change its approach since the June 2014 decision to short-list two bidders.Berlin is deciding whether to modernise its missile defences, based on Raytheon's Patriot system, or implement MEADS. A German decision to commit to Lockheed Martin's system would help the consortium meet Poland's requirement that all proposed solutions have to be operational and in use by another NATO member state's armed forces.""Poland wants its missile defence systems to be compatible with German ones, because Germany is our closest ally,"" the source said.Last year, a senior German government source told Reuters the decision could come in 2015, once technical and legal questions have been clarified.According to a document seen by Reuters, the decision could be made this summer, but the Polish Ministry of Defence source said Poland thought Berlin could reach a decision as soon as Feb. 15.The United States, Italy and Germany spent about $3.4 billion over the past decade to develop MEADS as a successor to Patriot, but the United States decided in 2012 to withdraw due to budget cuts.

Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, last month warned that delays in delivery of the Operational Ground Control System (OCX) posed risks to the Air Force's ability to operate GPS satellites.He cited a three-year delay in the operational evaluation of the new ground system to early 2019, and said the Air Force would not receive the first OCX control station until after up to eight GPS III satellites were built and launched. Lockheed Martin Corp builds the GPS III satellites, but the program has faced delays due in part to technical challenges with a sensor built by Exelis Inc.Air Force officials said Lockheed missed expectations on the program, but they had not decided whether to open the next set of GPS III satellites to competition.The Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center said the schedule for the OCX system was in synch with the needs of the satellite constellation, but further delays were possible. ""There is a risk of further slips to OCX which could require a contingency operations capability"" that would allow GPS III satellites to enter service before the ground station is delivered, said Tina Greer, spokeswoman for the center.She said the Air Force was studying options to keep the program on schedule, but gave no details.Raytheon said it will deliver a separate early OCX system in time to support the launch of the first GPS III satellite.Teague acknowledged past problems with the OCX program, but said ultimately it would deliver the ""most hardened information assurance system ever delivered by the Department of Defense, meeting complex and demanding cybersecurity requirements.""

128,"  (Adds comments from Raytheon)By Tulay KaradenizANKARA Feb 19 Turkey's defence minister said on Thursday the country does not plan to integrate a new missile defence system with NATO infrastructure and officials said a $3.4 billion deal with China was still under consideration.NATO member Turkey chose China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp as a preferred bidder in 2013, prompting U.S. and Western concern about security and the compatibility of the weaponry with NATO systems.Defence Minister Ismet Yilmaz, in a written response to a parliamentary question, indicated Ankara planned to go ahead with the Chinese system, saying the evaluation of bids had been completed and no new offers received. ""The system in question will be integrated with the national system for Turkey's defence and will be used without integrating with NATO,"" Yilmaz said.However, other government officials later made clear that did not mean a final decision had yet been reached. ""We are continuing discussions with all the bidders,"" the undersecretariat for defence industries said in a statement.U.S. and NATO officials are unhappy with Turkey's choice of the China Precision Machinery, which has been under U.S. sanctions for selling items to Iran, Syria or North Korea that are banned under U.S. laws to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Eurosam, which is owned by Franco-Italian missile maker MBDA and France's Thales, came second in the tender. U.S.-listed Raytheon Co also put in an offer with its Patriot missile defense system, which is now operated by 13 countries around the world.Tim Glaeser, vice president with Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems business, said that Turkey had recently asked for additional clarifications about Raytheon's proposal.""It's our understanding that they are continuing to evaluate proposals from the French and the United States,"" Glaeser said. ""There's renewed interest. We're still in the game.""

129,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. government has approved Raytheon Co to export a new Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) sensor based on gallium nitride semiconductor technology to countries that have Patriot missile defense systems, the company said Thursday.Raytheon has invested more than $150 million over the past 15 years in gallium nitride, or GaN, and it is part of a new Air and Missile Defense Radar that Raytheon is building for the U.S. Navy, as well as several Air Force programs.The export release of the new GaN-based AESA radar could boost Raytheon's prospects in a big Polish missile defense competition since it would give the system the ability to see a 360-degree view of potential threats.Tim Glaeser, vice president at Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, said the new GaN-based sensor was ""gamechanging"" because it would help improve the reliability of the radar and lower its operating and maintenance costs.Raytheon is bidding against a French competitor in Poland. Glaeser said a decision by Poland or another foreign country to buy the new GaN-based AESA radar would help ensure that the U.S. Army could upgrade to the new capability in 2017.U.S. Army officials have said they plan to operate the Patriot system through 2048, but there is no funding in the Army budget for Patriot upgrades until 2017. Over $100 million in research and development investments, and a big order by the United Arab Emirates helped kick off the previous modernization of the Patriot weapons system.Glaeser said Raytheon had demonstrated the new GaN-based sensors at its test facility in New Hampshire in December for a U.S. government group and a high-level German delegation. The testing showed the sensors could help the Patriot system track ballistic missiles and other targets outside its current range.He said Germany is expected to make a decision in the late spring or early summer. Poland is also expected to make a decision about a new missile defense system this year. ""We've been able to demonstrate a solution that's low-cost, low-risk and very, very effective,"" Glaeser said, noting the new sensor could be added onto existing Patriot fire units without having to bring the fire units back to the company's facilities.He said the new technology would be available to each of the 13 countries already operating the Patriot system and other countries like Turkey that are looking at possible orders.

Defense sources said the more recent tests took place last week and on Tuesday. The latter coincided with international negotiations on Iran's disputed nuclear program that have drawn censure from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and in turn soured his relations with U.S. President Barack Obama.Moshe Yaalon, Israel's defence minister, cited David's Sling as a mark of the continued vigour of the Israeli-U.S. alliance.""We believe that next year it (David's Sling) is going to be operational,"" Yaalon told visiting U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, and added thanks for Washington's funding.David's Sling and its Stunner interceptor missiles successfully hit ""threat representative targets"" in the tests, said Rick Lehner, spokesman for the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, which carried out the third series of tests of the system together with the Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO). ""This ... is a major milestone in the development of the David's Sling weapon and provides confidence in future Israeli capabilities to defend against the developing threat,"" he said.MDA Director Vice Admiral James Syring said Washington was pleased with the test results and vowed to continue U.S. assistance to Israel's missile defense technology efforts.Known in Hebrew as Magic Wand, David's Sling is being developed and manufactured jointly by Israel's state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd and Raytheon Co, a top U.S. arms maker. Designed to shoot down rockets with ranges of 100 km to 200 km (63 miles to 125 miles), aircraft or low-flying cruise missiles, David's Sling will fill the operational gap between Israel's Iron Dome short-range rocket interceptor and the Arrow ballistic missile interceptor, both already in service.The latest successful tests are likely to strengthen support among U.S. lawmakers for Israel's request for additional funds.Israeli officials last month asked Congress for an additional $317 million for David's Sling and other Israeli missile defense programs, on top of $158 million already requested by the Obama administration in its fiscal 2016 budget.Fuelling the sense of urgency around David's Sling development, Israeli media on Wednesday published military assessments that, in the next war with Hezbollah, the guerrillas could rain up to 1,500 rockets on Israel daily, killing hundreds of civilians.The latest tests were conducted under unusually strict secrecy, and had been rescheduled at least once. One date that had been considered, planners said, was March 3 -- hours before Netanyahu, at Boehner's invitation, gave a speech at the U.S. Congress that both praised Obama for supporting Israel's security but rebuked him over the nuclear diplomacy with Iran.David's Sling was first tested on Nov. 25, 2012, shooting down a simulated rocket.

144,"  * Poland to buy U.S. Patriot missiles in $5 bln tender* Says eyes Airbus helicopter in $3 bln tender* France says Poland to have key industrial role   (Adds comment from U.S. State Department)By Wiktor Szary and Marcin GoettigWARSAW, April 21 Poland said on Tuesday it would buy Raytheon Co's Patriot missiles from the United States and provisionally selected French Airbus Group  helicopters as it speeds up the modernization of its military amid tensions with Russia.The choice of suppliers, in deals potentially worth $8 billion, strikes a trans-Atlantic balance as Eastern Europe's largest economy re-arms itself on NATO's frontline while edging toward a bigger role in Europe's defense industry.""For the armed forces' technical modernization and the Polish armed forces' resilience to be effective, the so-called anti-missile shield ... had to become the priority of priorities,"" said Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski.Poland will enter exclusive talks with the U.S. government on the Patriot missile defense system. It plans to buy eight missile batteries by 2025, including two within three years of signing. A consortium of France's Thales and European group MBDA was also competing for the $5 billion missile defense contract - the largest in Poland's military history.The United States said it welcomed the announcement from its stalwart NATO ally.The program ""is expected to generate at least $2.5 billion in U.S. export content - that means supporting American jobs at home and growing our manufacturing base,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement.Poland, a NATO member since 1999, had accelerated the process to select a supplier for the missile system after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula last year prompted great concern among NATO members in Eastern Europe. Since the end of the Cold War, Poland has usually kept closer defense and security ties with the United States.But in the past few years, policymakers have been lobbying for a stronger security relationship with the rest of Europe, especially after the Obama administration scaled back its missile defense shield plans in Eastern Europe.AIRBUS STATUS  Poland also named the Caracal EC725 of Airbus Helicopters as its preferred choice in a $3 billion utility helicopter tender, subject to army testing, dropping U.S. and Italian competitors.It trimmed the potential order from an original 70 helicopters to 50. This would still represent Poland's biggest defense acquisition from Western Europe since the end of the Cold War. Deliveries could begin as early as 2017.The helicopter decision was seen as delicate because rival bidders Sikorsky, United Technologies Corp's helicopter unit in the United States, and AgustaWestland, owned by Italy's Finmeccanica, have factories in Poland whose unions had warned of job losses.A French defense official said the Caracal helicopters and their Turbomeca engines would both be assembled in Poland as part of a wide-ranging industrial pact. Airbus has offered what could evolve into ""fifth nation"" status for Poland alongside its Western European founders to support its bid.The official said Poland had monitored France's decision last year to suspend delivery of warships to Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis, but denied any explicit link between that move and Poland's decision to buy French hardware.Poland said that because of ""changing security circumstances,"" it had decided to speed up a separate acquisition of attack helicopters.Four companies have expressed interest in supplying some 30 units in a deal already brought forward by two years in light of the crisis in Ukraine.

160,"  (Repeats story with no change to text)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON May 15 A U.S.-supplied missile shield to protect Gulf nations against Iranian attacks will take years to complete, requiring a step-up in regional trust, more U.S. sales of sensitive weapons, and intensive U.S. training to avoid mishaps in the volatile region.A renewed joint commitment to build the regional defense system was one of the few firm outcomes of Thursday's Camp David summit between President Barack Obama and Gulf allies, which were seeking fresh U.S. defense pledges ahead of a possible nuclear deal they fear will empower arch-rival Iran.Past efforts have stalled due to tension and mistrust within the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) but U.S. and Gulf officials say the time is now ripe to push ahead as Arab nations mount more joint military missions.A joint statement following the summit said that the GCC states were committed to developing a ballistic missile defense capability, including an early warning system, with U.S. technical help. Washington pledged to fast-track arms transfers to the GCC states and to send a team to the region in the coming weeks to discuss the details.The Gulf nations fear that the sanctions relief that would accompany a nuclear deal with Tehran due by June 30 could revive Iran's economy and enable it to acquire more accurate and reliable missiles.An integrated defense system would allow Gulf countries to better repel an Iranian attack, stitching together their radars and interceptors to counter a range of different missiles.The system would use U.S. early-warning satellites and a mix of U.S. and Gulf radars to detect the launch of an enemy missile and fire a ground- or sea-based missile to destroy it far above the earth. CLOSER SHARING NEEDED Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp would be key contenders to build a central command-and-control system for the shield since they already do similar work for the U.S. military and key allies.The biggest challenge to making the shield work would be securing a broad agreement on the rules for dealing with any threats, said Anthony Cordesman, a senior analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.""You have to work out the entire engagement structure before the first missile is ever launched,"" Cordesman said. Getting to that point will require unprecedented agreements between the U.S. military and the GCC, and among the often rancorous Gulf allies, to share sensitive data to avoid the risk of a friendly aircraft being shot down by mistake, experts said.Intensive U.S.-led training would also be vital to minimize the risk of mishaps, U.S. officials say.The U.S. military already has 10 Patriot missile batteries to defend against short-range ballistic missiles in the Gulf region and Jordan, as well as a powerful AN-TPY-2 radar system to scan for missile launches, according to U.S. officials.The Gulf countries are upgrading their existing Raytheon Patriot systems to incorporate new PAC-3 missiles built by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp, and are starting to buy wider-area and longer-range systems like the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), built by Lockheed.Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters in Washington this week that Gulf countries would need new ground-based networks and computer terminals to manage those systems. He said the Gulf countries also wanted longer-range options like the Raytheon SM-3 missile, which has not yet been released for export to the region.Washington has balked at selling a land-based Aegis combat system to deal with missile threats and any associated SM-3 missiles to Gulf countries, largely because such a system would be best suited to dealing with threats outside the earth's atmosphere that are beyond Iran's capability, Cordesman said.Washington's decision in December to allow U.S. arms sales to the GCC as an organization - similar to its arrangement with NATO - helped pave the way for progress on integrating missile defense and maritime security systems.""That's a huge step in the right direction,"" said a U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.Cordesman said Raytheon's new SM-6 missile could prove useful to address Gulf concerns since it could address threats inside the earth's atmosphere as well as outside.U.S. officials had no immediate comment on whether the Gulf countries had made any formal request for the SM-6 system.Al-Jubeir cautioned against expecting rapid progress on missile defense integration.""Those are complicated systems that take time to acquire and then take time to put in place,"" he said.

169,"  (Adds details on U.S. costs)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 7 The United States and Japan announced on Sunday the first live-fire test of Raytheon Co's  new Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missile that is being jointly developed by the two countries for several billion dollars.Rick Lehner, spokesman for the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, said the test conducted on Saturday from the Point Mugu Sea Range off the coast of California was a success. Lehner said the United States spent just over $2 billion on the weapons program, while Japan contributed about $1 billion.The SM-3 IIA is a 21-inch variant of an earlier SM-3 missile, which works with the U.S. Aegis combat system built by Lockheed Martin Corp to destroy incoming ballistic missile threats in space. Riki Ellison, who heads the non-profit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said: ""It is the U.S. Department of Defense's best case of equal funding and engineering shared with an allied country to develop and ... field a new weapon system to better enhance the national security of both nations.""Raytheon said the new SM-3 IIA missile had bigger rocket motors and a more capable kill vehicle that would allow the missile to engage threats sooner and protect larger regions from short- to intermediate-range ballistic missile threats. Saturday's test evaluated the performance of the missile's nosecone, steering control, and the separation of its booster, and second and third stages. No intercept was planned, and no target missile was launched, said U.S. and company officials.""The success of this test keeps the program on track for a 2018 deployment at sea and ashore,"" said Taylor Lawrence, president of Raytheon's missile systems business.Ellison said three more years of testing were planned for the new missile before it was put to use on U.S. Navy Aegis ships, Japan's Kongo ships, and at land-based Aegis Ashore sites in Poland and Romania.

170,"  (Adds comments from German official, Raytheon, byline)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 9 Germany said on Tuesday it will buy the MEADS air and missile defense system from Europe's MBDA and Lockheed Martin Corp instead of an updated Patriot system offered by Raytheon Co, but said the companies would have to meet demanding performance milestones to retain the contract.Germany funded a quarter of the $4 billion invested by it, the United States and Italy to develop the Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS) as a successor to the Patriot air defense system fielded in the 1980s.Germany is the first country to choose the MEADS system, a decision worth up to $4.5 billion to the system's manufacturers, and industry officials say its decision could trigger a similar order from Italy and possibly the Netherlands. German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen announced the decision and said MEADS would make it possible to put a protective shield around entire cities and military camps.Von der Leyen said Germany plans to keep the huge new procurement program on track by setting up specific controls and  milestones. If the companies fail to meet those targets, Germany could still cancel the contract and give Patriot maker Raytheon another chance at the deal, she said.German opposition parties criticized the decision to proceed with the MEADs program, saying there were significant technical, financial and strategic concerns about the system. Lockheed and MBDA, a consortium that includes Italy's Finmeccanica SpA, Airbus Group and Britain's BAE Systems Plc, hailed the German decision.MBDA said MEADS would give the German military a powerful state-of-the-art system that can handle current and future threats, and said it recognized its responsibility in building a solid basis for the successful introduction of the system. Lockheed, the largest U.S. weapons maker, said in a statement that it was fully committed to the success of Germany's Taktisches Luftverteidigungssystem (TVLS) with MBDA.It said the system was designed to significantly reduce operation and support costs by covering a larger area with less manpower and equipment, and less demand on airlift.Raytheon said in a statement that it had not been formally notified of any decision by the German government, and would continue to support its ""consideration of alternatives prior to a final contract award"".The United States, citing budget cuts, opted out of the system in 2012.

Northrop and Boeing Co have also said they plan to compete for the contract when the Air Force launches a competition in the coming years.The head of Lockheed's aeronautics division, Orlando Carvalho, told Reuters the project would be led by Lockheed's Skunkworks research and development shop and would feature an open architecture that would allow the government to own the technical baseline for future upgrades. Lockheed will serve as the main integrator for the project, while Raytheon will bring its expertise with various surveillance sensors, mission systems integration, and JSTARS communications.Bombardier will provide its ultra-long-range Global business jet, which Lockheed said is less expensive to operate than modern airliners and requires less refueling. ""We plan to bring all this technology and expertise together to offer what we believe will be a very competitive solution,"" Carvalho said.Lockheed said the teaming agreement matched the U.S. government's desire for strong industry partnerships and would give the Air Force superior capabilities.Carvalho said it was the first time that Lockheed had teamed up to pursue a major program with Bombardier. The Air Force already uses the Bombardier Global as the basis for its  Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, or BACN program.

Revenues rose 3 percent to $5.8 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had forecast earnings of $488 million or $1.62 per share and revenues of $5.48 billion.The company said its $1.9 billion acquisition of Websense, a cybersecurity firm, was going better than expected and the unit should be accretive to earnings in two to three years, instead of three to four years as initially expected.Chief Executive Tom Kennedy told analysts the company saw strong demand for cybersecurity given continuing attacks on private and federal computer networks, as well as growing international demand for the company's weapons systems.He said international orders accounted for a record 44 percent of the company's backlog at the end of the second quarter, something he called a ""monumental"" achievement. That compared to 38 percent a year earlier. Kennedy said he was optimistic that U.S. lawmakers would agree to some measure to ease mandatory budget caps slated to resume in fiscal 2016, which could help domestic revenues return to growth late next year or early in 2017.""Both on the domestic and international (sides), we see a significant pipeline that will take us well beyond 2020,"" he said on a quarterly earnings call.Raytheon shares were trading $7.54, or 7.8 percent higher, at $104.53 around mid-morning on the New York Stock Exchange.Raytheon said it now expected $22.7 billion to $23.2 billion in revenues for the full year, up from its earlier forecast of $22.3 billion to $22.8 billion.

The contract calls for Lockheed to install the hardware and software needed for the combat system on board new Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and to modernize existing destroyers and cruisers to operate the latest version of Aegis, Baseline 9. The system allows ships to defend simultaneously against airborne threats, such as aircraft or cruise missiles, while also targeting and intercepting ballistic missiles, Lockheed said.

Lawmakers have 15 days to block the sale, although such action is rare since deals are usually vetted carefully before being formally notified to Congress.DSCA, which facilitates foreign arms sales, said the deal would enhance the Spanish military's ability to carry out surveillance and reconnaissance in support of NATO missions, and as part of other coalition efforts. It would also allow Spain to work better together with other MQ-9 operators including the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The agency said the Spanish Air Force would use the MQ-9s for homeland security, peacekeeping, counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations.Other contractors on the deal would include Raytheon Co  and L-3 Communications Holdings Inc, the agency said.

194,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 19 The business development company Starburst Accelerator, which calls itself the world's largest incubator for aerospace startups, said on Monday it has signed agreements with Boeing Co, Raytheon Co and other big companies looking for new technologies.Starburst will expose the big aerospace companies to its stable of fledgling aerospace companies with products ranging from drones to aircraft seats to complex aviation software. It says many of its start-ups have technology that could radically alter the way aircraft are now built and maintained.It opened its new California office on Oct. 2 with an event similar to the ""Shark Tank"" television program, an ABC TV reality show in which entrepreneurs seek investments from a panel of potential investors, known as ""sharks.""The goal is to match aerospace entrepreneurs with venture capitalists and larger companies that may invest in them or buy their products. The event gave 29 startups a chance to seek funding from 100 industry executives, venture capitalists and research institutes, said Starburst partner Van Espahbodi, who helped found the company in Paris three years ago.The California event was hosted by Boeing at its El Segundo office, while Raytheon Co is slated to host the next event on Dec. 4, also in El Segundo, Espahbodi, a former congressional staff member and Raytheon executive, told Reuters.Espahbodi said Starburst is also working with research centers in other cities, including Wichita, Kansas, Chicago, and Boston to help startups navigate the ""nebulous"" world of procurement. Starburst vets the startups carefully to ensure they have moved beyond ideas to solid intellectual property. Boeing, Panasonic Aviation, Booz Allen Hamilton and other big companies then pay a fee of $100,000 a year for access to the events and one-on-one work with the startup hunters. The companies and investors then decide which startups to help fund.Starburst is focused on commercial aerospace, but plans to move into weapons-related markets as well, particularly given the Pentagon's recent increased focus on innovation and developing ties to Silicon Valley, Espahbodi said. He is due to meet with officials from the White House and Federal Aviation Administration in Washington this week to describe the program.One firm that stood out at the Oct. 2 event was Enduralock, a company founded by a spinal surgeon who has patented a new vibration-resistant fastener technology for use on aircraft, Espahbodi said.Another more ""audacious"" startup, he said, was Natilus, which is developing large, autonomous drones that can deliver cargo, and can fly as low as 80 feet or as high as 40,000 feet. Natilus says the drones could cut the cost of shipping freight by 75 percent.Starburst plans to open another office in Singapore next year, company officials said.

205,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A federal appeals court has denied a lawsuit by Raytheon Co that sought to halt the U.S. Air Force's reevaluation of bids submitted for a new $1 billion long-range radar by Raytheon, Northrop Grumman Corp and Lockheed Martin Corp.Raytheon in May appealed a decision in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims that had cleared the way for the review. Raytheon first won the contract in October, but the matter was quickly protested by both losing bidders, prompting the Air Force to take a fresh look at the bids.In her decision, Judge Margaret Sweeney said the Air Force's decision to reopen the competition was justified since the agency had violated rules on equal communications with bidders about whether they could recover internal research and development spending (IR&D) linked to the bid.The Air Force initially told bidders such costs were not allowable, but later told Raytheon it could recover certain IR&D costs, which allowed it to lower its pricing. It did not relay that change in approach to Northrop.""That disparity in information favored Raytheon over Northrop,"" said the decision, which was dated Friday and posted on the court's website on Monday. The Air Force said the court's decision would allow it to ""continue source selection and take corrective action.""Justin Oakes, spokesman for Hanscomb Air Force Base in Massachusetts, which is overseeing the process, declined comment on when a new contract award could be announced. The companies submitted final program revisions at the beginning of October. The court's ruling came sooner than expected, which means the Air Force could announce a new contract award before the end of the year, said one source familiar with the matter.Raytheon said it was disappointed by the decision, but remained confident in its proposal to develop and build 30 Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) systems to replace the Air Force's current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s.The existing system can be torn down and transported via trucks or C-130 transport planes. The next-generation system must be able to perform a similar function.

206,"  (Adds Northrop comment, paragraph 11)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Oct 26 A federal appeals court has denied a lawsuit by Raytheon Co that sought to halt the U.S. Air Force's reevaluation of bids submitted for a new $1 billion long-range radar by Raytheon, Northrop Grumman Corp  and Lockheed Martin Corp.Raytheon in May appealed a decision in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims that had cleared the way for the review. Raytheon first won the contract in October, but the matter was quickly protested by both losing bidders, prompting the Air Force to take a fresh look at the bids.In her decision, Judge Margaret Sweeney said the Air Force's decision to reopen the competition was justified since the agency had violated rules on equal communications with bidders about whether they could recover internal research and development spending (IR&D) linked to the bid. The Air Force initially told bidders such costs were not allowable, but later told Raytheon it could recover certain IR&D costs, which allowed it to lower its pricing. It did not relay that change in approach to Northrop.""That disparity in information favored Raytheon over Northrop,"" said the decision, which was dated Friday and posted on the court's website on Monday.The Air Force said the court's decision would allow it to ""continue source selection and take corrective action."" Justin Oakes, spokesman for Hanscomb Air Force Base in Massachusetts, which is overseeing the process, declined comment on when a new contract award could be announced.The companies submitted final program revisions at the beginning of October. The court's ruling came sooner than expected, which means the Air Force could announce a new contract award before the end of the year, said one source familiar with the matter. Raytheon said it was disappointed by the decision, but remained confident in its proposal to develop and build 30 Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) systems to replace the Air Force's current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s.The existing system can be torn down and transported via trucks or C-130 transport planes.

215,"  (Adds Raytheon statement)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Dec 2 The Pentagon's chief arms buyer on Wednesday said he plans another ""deep dive"" review on Friday of a troubled Raytheon Co program to develop ground controls for a new generation of GPS satellites, and could decide to open part of the program to a new competition.Frank Kendall, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, told an industry conference he is ""very worried"" about the software-intensive Raytheon program, which has seen costs rise sharply due to what he called problems with contractor performance and cyber security requirements.The system is critical to the Air Force's ability to operate GPS, or global positioning system, satellites which help the military target weapons strikes, provide critical timing information and also provide critical services for commercial industry.After the speech, Kendall told reporters that Raytheon was nearing completion on some of the work, but said the department was looking at various alternatives, including launching a new competition, to complete the bulk of the work on the program. Kendall carried out a similar review of Raytheon's next-generation GPS Operational Control System, or OCX, earlier this year after its cost soared to $1.6 billion, up 80.5 percent from an initial contract value, and the program's completion was delayed by two years to 2018.The U.S. Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center awarded Raytheon a contract in February 2010 to develop the hardware and software needed to control U.S. GPS satellites and ensure the security of their signals, but the program has run into technical challenges and seen cost increases. Kendall said the program was still experiencing problems but gave no details. The Air Force's former top acquisition official, William LaPlante, told reporters before leaving office that the program was in ""bad"" shape, but did not elaborate.Matt Gilligan, Raytheon's vice president for navigation and environmental solutions, said the program was now on ""a strong foundation"" after completion of a number of critical corrective actions implemented since late 2013.""As a result, this vitally important program is now well positioned for predictable performance and strong execution going forward,"" Gilligan said in a statement. ""Raytheon firmly believes that GPS OCX is the best path forward to meet the country's needs for a completely capable and cyber hardened ground control system and the nation's full modernization requirements without compromise.""The OCX system passed the Pentagon's review last February, but Air Force officials said it would be monitored closely to ensure it stuck to cost and schedule targets.The Pentagon's chief weapons tester warned last January that an operational evaluation of the new ground system would be delayed to early 2019, and said the Air Force would not receive the first control station until after up to eight GPS III satellites were built and launched.Lockheed Martin Corp's program to build the GPS III satellites is back on track after delays involving a sensor built by Exelis Inc, which is now owned by Harris Corp.

He said the Air Force initially underestimated the challenge of securing the system from cyber attacks and later had to revise its approach. But he said Raytheon also ""did a really bad job"" of systems engineering before it began developing software code.""The OCX program is a disaster, just a disaster, and it’s embarrassing to have to stand in front of people and try to defend it, so I won't,"" Hyten told the event.

No intercept was planned for this test and no target missile was launched, but several intercept tests will following in coming years, said the source.The United States spent just over $2 billion on the SM-3 IIA weapons program, while Japan contributed about $1 billion, according to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.  The new missile is a 21-inch variant of an earlier SM-3 missile and works with the U.S. Aegis combat system built by Lockheed Martin Corp to destroy incoming ballistic missile threats in space.Tuesday's test marked another milestone toward deployment of the missile on U.S. Aegis destroyers and Japan's Kongo ships in coming years, as well as the U.S. Aegis Ashore site in Poland in 2018. The test also validated the new sensor seeker developed for the redesigned kill vehicle, or warhead, that will eventually replace the ones now used on the U.S. fleet of ground-based interceptors in Alaska and California that are part of the U.S. homeland missile defense system, the sources said.Neither Raytheon nor the U.S. Missile Defense Agency had any immediate comment.

231,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force will continue work on an alternative ground control program and explore outside options to hedge against further cost spikes and delays on Raytheon Co's (RTN.N) troubled ground control system for next-generation GPS satellites, according to an Air Force document seen by Reuters.The Air Force on Tuesday said a ""deep dive"" review led by the Pentagon's chief arms buyer last week resulted in a further two-year delay in completion of the Raytheon program and potential cost increases, but gave no additional details.The delays and cost increases are the latest troubles facing a program slammed as ""a disaster"" on Tuesday by General John Hyten, commander of Air Force Space Command. Raytheon won a contract worth up to $1.5 billion in 2010 to develop the GPS Operational Control System, or OCX, to operate the next generation GPS 3 satellites being built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N). By December 2014, the program's projected cost had soared to $3.6 billion, including inflation, due to increased cyber security requirements and poor contractor performance, according to Air Force and Pentagon officials.Earlier this month, Air Force officials estimated that the program could require an additional 47-month delay that could send its total cost, including inflation, as high as $5.6 billion, according to a source familiar with the issue.  However, officials agreed at Friday's deep-dive review to stretch the program only for 24 months, which should result in a smaller cost increase, said the source, who expressed continued skepticism despite the belief of some Air Force officials that the program was now beyond the worst of its problems.""This program is a big mess and there aren't any good options in terms of how to fix it,"" said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Starting from scratch with a new contractor would take too long, the source added, but the current plan meant that the Air Force would be unable to test or use the full capabilities of its new GPS 3 satellites for years after they were launched. Needed cyber security protections would also be delayed. At Friday's review, officials agreed to expand oversight of the program; institute quarterly reviews by the Pentagon's top acquisition official, Frank Kendall, and Raytheon Chief Executive Tom Kennedy; and expedite contingency plans meant to ensure the older GPS ground control system could be used to operate the new GPS 3 satellites until the new system was done.The Air Force also agreed to continue work on an alternative ground control system and explore options outside the OCX program, including adding military code functions to other systems, to hedge against further cost growth and delays. Air Force officials had no immediate comment on the additional, previously unreported, plans for the program, or the cost estimates prepared earlier this month. Raytheon declined to comment.The company is now expected to complete work on the OCX system by July 2022, two years later than expected in a revamped baseline established in October, the document showed.The longer 47-month delay would have increased the program's cost by over 30 percent from its current baseline, or 50 percent above the initial plan, triggering a live-or-die review of the program required under the Nunn-McCurdy law, the document said. It said it was uncertain if the shorter delay would also trigger such a review.

232,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force plans to revise its contract with Raytheon Co (RTN.N) for a new ground control network for GPS satellites after officials decided last week to delay completion of the program until July 2022, a senior official said Thursday.Major General Roger Teague, director of space programs for the Air Force's acquisition chief, told Reuters in an interview it was not clear how much the delay would add to the program, which was previously expected to cost $3.6 billion.He said the GPS program office would also review incentive fees associated with the contract to ensure they properly rewarded good performance and penalized the company if its performance did not improve.Raytheon has said it was committed to meeting the Air Force's expectations for the program, but declined to give any further details.Teague's comments followed a ""deep dive"" review last week by the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, Frank Kendall, of the troubled program, which was slammed as ""a disaster"" on Tuesday by General John Hyten, commander of Air Force Space Command. Raytheon won a contract worth up to $1.5 billion in 2010 to develop the GPS Operational Control System, or OCX, to operate the next-generation GPS 3 satellites being built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N).The project's cost had already more than doubled due to increased cyber security requirements and poor contractor performance, and now looks likely to rise further.Teague confirmed that Air Force officials initially estimated a delay of 47 additional months, first reported by Reuters on Wednesday.. He said Kendall opted for a shorter delay, coupled with aggressive oversight at all levels of the program, to ensure that the sorely-needed satellite control capability was delivered to the military.Teague said a new cost estimate would be done early next year, with Kendall and Raytheon Chief Executive Tom Kennedy to set meet for another quarterly ""deep dive"" review in early spring. Teague said Lieutenant General Samuel Greaves, commander of U.S. Space and Missiles Systems Center, would now meet weekly with a Raytheon vice president about the program, while Lieutenant Arnold Bunch, the top Air Force officer in charge of acquisition, would participate on a biweekly basis.Kendall decided not to restructure the contract as a fixed-price program because it would have reduced the government's oversight, Teague said. ""It's a team sport,"" he said. ""We need to have government participation and oversight and insight.""Teague said the Air Force was focused on getting the Raytheon program completed, but would keep its options open in case the new approach failed to get the program back on track.

Kendall said he would meet personally with Raytheon's chief executive, Tom Kennedy, once a quarter to review progress, and said he has engaged internal and external experts to keep independent tabs on the program.""It’s going to get as intense a management as I can bring to it and I’m expecting to see an improvement in performance,"" he  said. ""If we don’t, then we can consider some of those options again."" Kendall said he opted for the two-year delay instead of the 47-month delay initially proposed by the Air Force because Kennedy had assured him it was doable, and also because he did not want to ""give the program that kind of latitude.""The Air Force's initial proposal included a year of ""pure buffer ... and another year of presumed problems,"" he said.Kendall said Raytheon's problems on the program had gone on for years and the program ""has not been executed very well."" He said he and Kennedy would meet early next year to discuss the revised cost estimate and possible changes in the incentive fee structure in the existing cost-plus contract. He said it was not yet clear when the department would assess whether to continue with Raytheon or choose another contractor.Kendall had no immediate details on how much Raytheon's incentive fee had been docked due to poor performance. He said the issue could affect Raytheon's ratings in future weapons competitions, which assess ""past performance.""

Ill founded Triumph and served has served as CEO since April 2015, after previously serving as CEO from 1993 until his retirement in July 2012. He will remain a member of the board of the Berwyn, Pennsylvania-based company.Triumph shares closed at $40.98 per share, raising the company's market capitalization more than $300 million, to $1.7 billion. Crowley, who held senior positions with Lockheed Martin Corp before joining Raytheon in 2010, told Reuters he would study the company's business areas closely before making recommendations on any portfolio changes to the board.""Triumph is in need of some changes in operational execution and strategy,"" Crowley said. ""But the overall market in which Triumph competes is still a very attractive market,"" with expected annual growth of 4 percent of 7 percent per year, spurred by what he called the ""democratization of air travel.""He said he had been in touch with the CEOs of key customers, including Boeing Co, Northrop Grumman Corp, Airbus Group SE, Bombardier Inc, the Gulfstream unit of General Dynamics Corp and Brazil's Embraer SA about his new role, and received positive reactions.

He said major equipment manufacturers such as Boeing were pressuring suppliers to improve cost, quality and delivery times, and he hoped Triumph could win one of Boeing's annual operational excellence awards.He said Triumph had been, and would remain, active in the mergers and acquisitions market, but his initial focus would be on better integrating companies acquired in recent years and assessing the strengths of various business units.

It previously tested and intercepted dummy missiles that simulated short and medium-range ballistic missiles. The MDA is racing to improve the system after it failed to hit a dummy missile in five of eight tests conducted after the Bush administration rushed to deploy the system in 2004 to counter growing threats by North Korea. Boeing Vice President Norm Tew said the ICBM intercept test would include new technologies infused into the booster used to launch the ground-based interceptors, and other measures aimed at improving the reliability of the exoatmospheric kill vehicle (EKV), or warhead, designed by Raytheon Co. Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp are developing a redesigned kill vehicle for the interceptors, due to have its first flight test in 2018.Tew said he could not comment about whether the U.S. military was considering adding 10 ground-based interceptors to the three now in place at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The U.S. military is already adding 14 interceptors to the 27 interceptors in place at a second site in Alaska. ""There are a lot of things being considered,"" Tew said, noting that the Obama administration was evaluating possible missile defense sites in the northeastern United States.

""Nothing is too big to fail.""Pentagon chief arms buyer Frank Kendall is due to review the $3.6 billion program again in early March after a December restructuring that delayed its completion by two years.Officials have stopped short of cancelling the OCX program, which has seen costs double due to increased cyber requirements and poor contractor performance, citing the importance of the system.

It could eventually buy up to 600 planes, analysts said. Raytheon and Finmeccanica said using an existing aircraft instead of designing a new one would save the Air Force money, and could allow the planes to enter into service years before the target of 2024.Unlike other contenders, the M-346 aircraft had already demonstrated its capabilities for U.S. Air Force officials in Italy in 2014 as they were finalizing their requirements for the new training planes, officials from the companies said.The planes are already being used to train Israeli, Italian and Dutch pilots who will fly Lockheed F-35 fighter jets. Poland and Singapore also recently ordered the Finmeccanica jets for their pilot training programs, Jim Hvizd, vice president of business development for Raytheon's space and airborne systems division, told reporters at a joint news conference with Finmeccanica.He said Raytheon's T-100 aircraft, an advanced variant of the M-346, would also keep pilots safer than potential competitors since it had flight control technology that would stabilize the plane automatically if a pilot lost control. Raytheon and Finmeccanica began talks about a joint bid about 16 months ago, he said. Honeywell International Inc  will build the twin F124 turbofan engines to power the planes, and CAE Inc  will supply the ground training system.Raytheon officials said the company was assessing several sites where it would build portions of the plane, but gave no further details.

262,"  WARSAW Poland has relaunched talks with Lockheed Martin's MEADS on a medium-range air- and missile-defense system, the deputy defense minister was quoted as saying in comments published on Thursday.The tender, whose value defense officials estimate at around $5 billion, is central to Warsaw's large-scale army modernization program, speeded up in response to the Ukraine crisis and Russia's renewed assertiveness in the region. Poland had previously excluded the U.S. Lockheed-led consortium from the tender, short-listing two contenders: a consortium of European group MBDA and France's Thales SA, and U.S. firm Raytheon Co, as potential suppliers.Last year, Poland's former center-right government announced it would purchase Raytheon's Patriot system, a decision which the Law and Justice (PiS) party, then in opposition but now in government, said it would review should it come to power.Speaking to Reuters shortly before the election, Bartosz Kownacki, who went on to become deputy defense minister in charge of army modernization, said a PiS government would reconsider Lockheed's offer as a cheaper option. Following PiS' decisive election victory in October, the conservatives challenged the deal, questioning the ""original cost and timeline assumptions of Raytheon's offer, as well as those regarding the scope of (U.S.) cooperation with Polish industry"" - a reference to how many of the jobs involved might go to Poles, and to potential technology sharing.""We're relaunching talks with MEADS,"" daily Dziennik Gazeta Prawna quoted Kownacki as saying in a report published on Thursday.""We're still discussing who will be the supplier of the missile defense ... solution. Various options and various suppliers are possible. It all depends on the conditions which will be offered to us,"" Kownacki said. ""We have always maintained that our previous MEADS offer for the ... program remains valid,"" said Marty Coyne, MEADS director of business development in a statement sent to Reuters.Raytheon said it was supporting the negotiations between Washington and Warsaw regarding the sale of the Patriot system, and was in discussion with the Polish defense industry on technology transfer and jobs. ""Raytheon has a proven track record of successfully meeting offset obligations and placing work in country,"" it said in a statement sent to Reuters.Earlier this month, Kownacki said that Raytheon's Patriot remained Poland's first choice in the tender, but only if the price was lowered and Poland could access certain U.S. defense technologies.

276,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, March 24  WASHINGTON, March 24 The Pentagon on Thursday said the estimated cost of Raytheon Co's ground control system for next-generation GPS satellites rose 16.3 percent to $4.2 billion in 2015 - even before a two-year delay decision that will add more cost.The Raytheon GPS Operational Control System (OCX) - dubbed the Air Force's ""No. 1 troubled program"" by a top general last month - is now forecast to cost $586.4 million more than the $3.6 billion previously expected.The new estimate is 180 percent over the $1.5 billion value of the contract when it was first awarded to Raytheon in 2010. Costs have soared due to technical issues related to tough cyber requirements, and poor performance, according to Pentagon officials.Air Force spokeswoman Captain Annmarie Annicelli said the new Pentagon estimate reflected cost growth and schedule delays reported during a February 2015 program review, but not further cost overruns and delays that triggered tough program reviews by Pentagon officials in December 2015 and March 2016. The Pentagon's chief arms buyer, Frank Kendall, decided in December to delay the program's completion by two years, a move that is expected to further increase the cost of the program.Annicelli said the Air Force was still assessing the impact of those changes and had not yet released a new cost estimate. The Defense Department is due to conduct another comprehensive review of the long-delayed system in about three months together with Raytheon Chief Executive Tom Kennedy.Lieutenant General Samuel Greaves, who heads the Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center, last month described OCX program as the Air Force's ""No. 1 troubled program."" He said the Air Force was exploring alternatives, including with Lockheed Martin Corp, which builds the newest GPS satellites. The Raytheon program could be canceled if the company did not improve its performance, he said at the time.U.S. military officials have thus far stopped short of canceling the OCX program, citing the importance of the system at a time when China, Russia, Iran and other countries are aggressively attacking U.S. military systems such as GPS.OCX will be the first satellite control system designed after the advent of significant jamming and other cyber threats.

300,"   By Andrea Shalal | FARNBOROUGH, England  FARNBOROUGH, England Raytheon Co (RTN.N) on Monday said it saw bright prospects for continued sales of its Patriot air defense missile systems, citing strong interest among its 13 operator countries in adding a 360-degree AESA radar to their existing systems.The U.S. government last year gave permission for Raytheon to export the new radar to countries that have Patriot missile defense systems. Raytheon says the new radar gives the system a 360-degree view of potential threats, makes it more reliable to operate, and lower its operating and maintenance costs.Wes Kremer, president of Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems business, said regular meetings by Patriot operators to decide on potential software and hardware upgrades meant the weapons system would continue to adapt to evolving threats.""Patriot today is stronger than it’s ever been, and I believe our future is brighter than it's ever been,"" Kremer told Reuters at the Farnborough International Airshow.  Kremer declined to provide any detailed estimates on how many 360-degree active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar units the company could sell, but all 13 countries that operate the current system are potential candidates. He said Raytheon was keeping a close eye on developments in Germany, which last year chose Lockheed Martin Corp's (LMT.N) rival MEADS system to replace its Patriots, in the hope that the decision could still be reversed.  The German defense ministry last week notified lawmakers that it might not finish negotiations with Lockheed and local units of Europe's multinational missile firm MBDA about the MEADS system before year-end, raising questions over whether the deal could be finished before national elections in 2017.Germany announced it would use the MEADS system to replace its Patriot system bought in the 1980s, but set up demanding performance milestones that the companies must meet to retain the contract. Kremer said Raytheon was convinced that Patriot offered Germany a more reliable and proven system that would also be cheaper to operate and modernize in the future than MEADS.""The Germans have ... set up very strict gates or checkpoints along the way that they have to meet, both contractually and technically. This is the first indication that some of those things may be challenging,"" he said.

Germany announced it would use the MEADS system to replace its Patriot system bought in the 1980s, but set up demanding performance milestones that the companies must meet to retain the contract.Kremer said Raytheon was convinced that Patriot offered Germany a more reliable and proven system that would also be cheaper to operate and modernise in the future than MEADS.""The Germans have ... set up very strict gates or checkpoints along the way that they have to meet, both contractually and technically. This is the first indication that some of those things may be challenging,"" he said.

The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company's shares rose 2.4 percent to $138.60 in premarket trading on Thursday. Raytheon also raised its 2016 forecast for earnings from continuing operations, partly due to a lower tax rate and fall in interest expenses.The company benefited from a big backlog from previous years, mainly in missile systems and space and airborne systems, Chief Financial Officer Toby O'Brien told Reuters. Sales in Raytheon's missile systems unit, its biggest business, increased 6 percent in the second quarter. The business, which makes laser- and GPS-guided smart bombs, accounted for more than a quarter of the company's total revenue.  Sales rose 9.3 percent in the space and airborne systems business, which makes tracking, targeting and navigation sensors for aircraft, drones and missiles, helped by higher revenue from classified programs. O'Brien said Raytheon got nearly a third of its sales from clients outside the United States. Of this, about half came from the Middle East and Africa regions.

306,"   By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo | TOKYO  TOKYO Japan is upgrading its Patriot PAC-3 missile defense system in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, adding range and accuracy needed to intercept more advanced North Korean ballistic missiles, four sources with knowledge of the plan said.The move represents the most significant upgrade to Japan's missile defense system in a decade and is part of an increase in military spending in the region, where geopolitical tensions are rising. The rollout of the new advanced Missile Segment Enhancement, which could double the range of the current PAC-3 missiles to around 30 km (19 miles), will likely start next year, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the project. ""The upgraded PAC-3 is necessary to counter the Musudan,"" said one source, referring to Pyongyang's intermediate-range ballistic missile. North Korea in June test-fired what appeared to be two Musudan rockets. The first failed, but the second traveled 400 km (250 miles), more than halfway towards the southwest coast of Japan and reached a height of 1,000 km - enough altitude to give its warhead a range of more than 3,000 km (1,800 miles).Experts said that test represented a technological advance for the Pyongyang regime, which is also developing nuclear weapons. It puts it one step closer to being able to lob a warhead that could plunge to its target at speeds of several kilometers a second, potentially too fast for the current PAC-3 batteries that are the last line of defense against missile strikes.South Korea's military operates the older PAC-2 system and has a program to replace it with the PAC-3 system by 2018, a South Korean defense ministry official said. U.S. forces based in the country were also planning to upgrade their PAC-3 batteries covering the capital Seoul, the official added.  RISING TENSIONS  Along with North Korea's missile and nuclear tests, tensions in Asia are being fueled by ongoing territorial disputes between China and Japan in the East China Sea, and between China and several Southeast Asian nations in the South China Sea. China is swiftly modernizing its armed forces, in part to counter what it sees as a strategy of containment in the United States' Asian ""pivot"".A spokesman for Japan's Defence Ministry said ""nothing has been decided"" on the PAC-3 upgrade. The International Olympic Committee's decision to grant Tokyo the 2020 games will help unlock funding for the PAC-3 upgrade despite military budget constraints, the sources told Reuters. Around 100 billion yen ($955 million) in funding would be requested in the next defense budget proposal for the year starting April 2017, one of the sources said. Funding will need cabinet approval before going into the national budget and additional funds would have to be approved for subsequent years.Japan is also considering purchasing the advanced Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, anti-missile system, which Washington and Seoul agreed to deploy in South Korea earlier this month. That decision sparked a complaint from China, which said it would destabilize the regional security balance.The Patriot upgrade would likely be an enhancement to Japan's ballistic missile defense, rather than an alternative to THAAD or a similar system. Japan also has Aegis-equipped destroyers patrolling the Sea of Japan that are loaded with interceptor missiles designed to hit incoming projectiles. It is currently developing a new version dubbed the Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) with the United States designed to destroy ballistic warheads in space, although no decision on a roll out has yet been made.The PAC-3 system was developed by Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co. Japan's biggest defense contractor, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), will begin work on Japan's systems under license after April next year, the sources said.MHI will upgrade 12 batteries in the first year, another 12 the following year with four in the subsequent twelve months, the sources said. Those guarding the Tokyo area will take priority and some used for training will not be upgraded.""The Ministry of Defence has not made any announcement regarding this, so as a commercial company we are not in a position to comment,"" a MHI spokeswoman said.Raytheon did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a Lockheed spokeswoman said the company had ""a long and successful history of working with Japanese industry in their production of the PAC-3 missile system under license”.

327,"   By Andrea Shalal and Sabine Siebold | BERLIN  BERLIN U.S. weapons maker Raytheon Co said on Friday it could start upgrading Germany's Patriot missile defense system in about a year if Berlin decides against a rival system built by Europe's MBDA and U.S.-based Lockheed Martin Corp.Wes Kremer, who heads Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems division, said the company could also upgrade Germany's Patriot system for less than the estimated cost of the rival Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), made by MBDA and Lockheed,.Raytheon lost out on the work last year when Germany picked the MEADS system, but the company is keeping close tabs on the defense ministry's slow-moving efforts to hammer out a contract with MBDA.Sources familiar with the matter say the MBDA's formal proposal for the program came in billions of euros higher than the previous estimate of 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) when it was submitted in September. Some ministry officials have already raised the possibility of upgrading Patriot given the jump in the MEADS projected cost, the sources said. ""They refer to us as the Plan B,"" Kremer told Reuters in an interview during a visit to Berlin. ""I'm confident we can do it for much less than the MEADS budget.""Raytheon argues that upgrading the Patriot system would save Germany money in the short and long term, allowing it to continue to benefit from upgrades and reliability improvements funded by all 13 countries that operate the system. If Berlin stuck with the MEADS system, it alone would be responsible for all such modifications and updates, Kremer said.""Europe and NATO is about pooling resources and pooling money to work together ... and Patriot really is the epitome of that,"" he said.The MEADS system was developed jointly by Germany, Italy and the United States over the last decade, although the U.S. Army later decided not to buy the system for its own use.  The German defense ministry says it is still reviewing the bid submitted by MBDA, jointly owned by Airbus Group, Britain's BAE Systems Plc and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica SpA. MBDA has declined to comment.Kremer said Germany could quickly upgrade the capability of its Patriot system to match upgrades now being carried out by the United States. Berlin could later acquire a 360-degree radar that is to be developed as part of a separate program for which Raytheon is bidding in Poland. That radar system would take about five years to complete, he said. MEADS, which is also vying for the Polish work, includes a 360-degree radar system that has already been developed and tested.Kremer, who met with Polish officials in Warsaw this week, said he remained confident Raytheon and the U.S. government would eventually complete a contract with Poland despite Warsaw's decision to continue talks with Lockheed about MEADS.He declined to estimate when the agreement could be completed.Kremer said Raytheon had made good progress in working out arrangements for at least 50 percent of the work to be carried out in Poland. ""We are on a path to closure for this,"" he said.

331,"   By Lidia Kelly | WARSAW  WARSAW Poland may be granted U.S. government export approval to buy eight Patriot missile defence systems from Raytheon Co  within the next few months, a senior Raytheon official told a Polish news agency on Friday.NATO member Poland has sped up efforts to overhaul its military following Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and Moscow's renewed military and political assertiveness in the region.Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz said on Friday Russian unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) had repeatedly violated Poland's airspace. The Rzeczpospolita daily, citing border guard documents, said Russia has sent its drones over Poland from the Kaliningrad Region at least four times this year. ""Unfortunately, we have to say that threats associated with (Russian) drones are nothing new, it is a process that we have observed throughout the year,"" PAP news agency cited Macierewicz as saying. Poland asked Washington in September for approval to buy the systems, aiming to close a $5 billion deal that is central to a thorough modernization of its armed forces by 2023. As advanced military technology, special permission must be obtained from the U.S. government for purchase.     ""Concrete decisions are expected within the next few months,"" John Baird, vice president of Raytheon Poland programs, told the private Newseria Biznes agency.Poland is also in talks with Lockhead Martin's MEADS joint venture regarding the acquisition of Medium Extended Air Defense Systems (MEADS).
