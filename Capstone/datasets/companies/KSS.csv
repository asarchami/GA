2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 10 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on Kohl's  Corporation (Kohl's), including the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+', and  has revised the Rating Outlook to Negative from Stable. A full list of ratings  is provided at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the company's strong market share position as the  third-largest department store retailer in the U.S., industry-leading operating  margins, convenient off-mall store format, and high penetration of  higher-margined private and exclusive brands.  The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch's concern around Kohl's soft comparable  store sales (comps) trend and the resulting pressure on EBITDA since late 2011.  Comps for 2013 are down approximately 1.3%, with sales trends weak throughout  the year, including the 2% comps decline during the fourth quarter. Fitch  attributes the deceleration to weak store traffic trends given the company's  budget-constrained and value-focused customer base; increasing competition from  alternative channels; and the slowdown in the growth of private and exclusive  brands that have historically supported the company's top-line growth.  Fitch expects investment grade retailers to have strong comps trends and remain  market share gainers. Looking at the overall domestic apparel, accessories, and  home-related categories, Fitch expects a market consolidator would need to  generate top-line growth of 2% or above to ward off competition from other  channels such as specialty, discount, and online.  Given the modest contribution to sales from store growth expected for 2014/2015  (estimated at 50 bps annually assuming 10 new store openings), Kohl's could  achieve 2% top-line growth by generating flat-to-modest comps growth at the  store level and online sales growth in the mid-teens that would contribute  roughly 150 bps to overall comps. The company's store level comps have been under increasing pressure - declining  approximately 1%, 1.8% and 2.6%, respectively, in 2011-2013. This has been  somewhat offset by online revenue which has grown from approximately $740  million in 2010 to a projected $1.7 billion in 2013, contributing approximately  150 bps to overall comps annually. The inability to stabilize store-level comps  could hinder overall comps from growing at 1.5% or better, which could pressure  ratings in the next 12-24 months. Kohl's strong growth in private and exclusive brands (which currently account  for 52% of sales) had offset the modestly negative growth in national brands.  However, growth in private brands has decelerated to the low single digits (from  the mid-single-digit range in 2011/2012) while national brands continue to  remain under pressure. Given a more competitive market for national brands and  the lack of any significant product launches on the exclusive side, overall  comps could remain flat in 2014.  Fitch expects Kohl's gross margin to be relatively flat to 2012 levels in the  mid-36% range in 2013 through 2015. Kohl's EBITDA margin is expected to be  around 14% in 2013, relative to the 15.8%-15.9% range in 2010/2011, and be flat  to modestly lower over the next two years.  The decline reflects Kohl's  investment in sharper pricing and inventory repositioning over the last several  quarters. However, the current level is still on par with other industry leaders  in the department store space such as Macy's Inc. and Nordstrom, Inc.  Fitch expects Kohl's EBITDA to hover around the $2.7 billion level (versus $3  billion in 2011) and adjusted debt/EBITDAR to remain in the 2.3x-2.4x range over  the next two to three years, which is in line with Fitch's expectation but  modestly above the company's currently stated leverage target of 2.0x-2.25x.    Free cash flow (FCF) generation has typically been strong for Kohl's and is  expected to be in the $800 million range annually in 2013 through 2015. This  assumes working capital swings are neutral and capital expenditures are in the  $700 million-$750 million range to support e-commerce growth, store openings (10  units in 2014) and remodelling program (35-50 expected for 2014 versus 30 in  2013 and 50 in 2012). Fitch expects FCF to be directed toward share buybacks.  Kohl's liquidity is supported by its strong cash balance of around $1 billion  and a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving bank credit facility due in June  2018. Kohl's has no debt maturities prior to 2017. RATING SENSITIVITIES For a Stable Outlook, the company would need to gain traction on comps growth to  a level of 1.5% or above and sustain EBITDA margins at current levels.  A negative rating action could result in the event of one or more of the  following: --If retail store comps fail to stabilize and overall comps (including online  sales) do not improve to a level of 1.5% or better in the next 12-24 months. --A weakening profitability profile (where EBITDA drops to below $2.6 billion)  and/or a more aggressive financial posture that would take leverage above 2.5x. Fitch has affirmed Kohl's ratings as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+'; --$1 billion bank credit facility at 'BBB+; --Senior unsecured notes and debentures at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

Penney Co Inc , posted weak sales in the key U.S. holiday quarter. Bad weather, a weak consumer spending environment and fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas resulted in a tough holiday shopping season for U.S. retailers, many of whom were forced to discount heavily to attract shoppers.Dick's maintained its merchandise margin levels consistent with last year, Chief Executive Edward Stack said in a statement, suggesting that the company did not have to offer deep discounts. Dick's, which sells everything from camping and golfing gear to winter wear and guns, said same-store sales rose 7 percent in the quarter ended Feb. 2, faster than its forecast of 3-4 percent.The company estimated earnings of $1.10-$1.11 per share for the quarter, above its prior forecast of $1.04-$1.07 per share. Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.06 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Dick's also forecast 2014 earnings of $3.03-$3.08 per share, below the average analyst estimate of $3.09 per share.The company's shares were up 7 percent at $54.75 before the bell.

16,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on Kohl's  Corporation (Kohl's), including the Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+', and  has revised the Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative. A full list of ratings  is provided at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmation reflects the company's strong market share position as the  third-largest department store retailer in the U.S., convenient off-mall store  format, strong EBITDA margin in the 13.8%-14% range and strong free cash flow  generation. The revision to a Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that  Kohl's operating performance will stabilize in 2015, and for leverage to be in  the 2.3x range over the next two to three years. Fitch expects Kohl's top-line  growth to be in the positive 1.5%-2.0% range, which reflects flat to modestly  negative store level comparable store sales (comps) growth, versus negative 2%  in 2014, and online sales growth in the mid-teens that would contribute roughly  150 bps to overall comps.  While store traffic trends remain weak given the company's budget-constrained  and value-focused customer base, Kohl's has taken various initiatives to improve  sales, including investments in its omnichannel platform and increasing national  brand presence to compete more effectively against the growth in off-price  retailers. Comp for 2014 were down 0.3%, with total sales growth flat for the  year. The close to flat comp was mainly due to a stronger than expected fourth  quarter comp of positive 3.7%. Online revenue has been a major contributor to  top line, growing from approximately $740 million in 2010 to over $2 billion in  2014, contributing over 150 bps to overall comps annually, essentially  offsetting negative store level comps. Fitch expects store level comps to be  flat to modestly negative over the next 24-36 months, which along with mid-teens  growth in ecommerce, should generate top line growth of 1.5% to 2.0% annually.  Kohl's continued to focus on upgrading its national brand presence, adding over  15 new brands to its portfolio in 2014, realizing 180 bps growth in national  brand penetration to 50% of sales. These include IZOD, Juicy, Fitbit, and  Nespresso, as well as its recent partnership with Bliss. The national brands  contributed to a higher AUR (average unit retail) and the company expects  penetration to continue to increase. Given more emphasis on national brands,  Fitch believe Kohl's is better positioning itself to be more competitive in the  market against off-price retailers that offer well recognized brands at highly  competitive or discounted prices.  Fitch expects Kohl's gross margin to be relatively flat in the mid-36% range  over the next 24 months. Kohl's EBITDA margin is expected to be stabilize around  14% in 2015. This is relative to the 15.8%-15.9% range in 2010/2011, given  weakness in comps and Kohl's investments in sharper pricing, inventory  repositioning, and omnichannel initiatives. However, the current EBITDA level is  still in-line with other industry leaders in the department store space such as  Macy's Inc. and Nordstrom, Inc. Fitch expects Kohl's annual EBITDA to hover around the $2.6 billion - $2.7  billion level over the next 24 months and adjusted debt/EBITDAR to be in the  2.3x range over the next two to three years, modestly above the company's  currently stated leverage target of 2.0x-2.25x. Kohl's liquidity is supported by its strong cash balance of around $1.4 billion  as of Jan. 31, 2015, and a $1 billion senior unsecured revolving bank credit  facility due in June 2018. Kohl's has no debt maturities prior to 2017. Kohl's  has generated strong FCF of $950 million to $1 billion annually since 2010 (with  the exception of 2012 when FCF was $180 million given a working capital use of  $0.5 billion and elevated capital expenditure). Fitch expects FCF to be in the  $700 million range annually over the next 24 -36 months. This assumes working  capital swings are neutral and a ramp up capital expenditures to the $800  million range to support e-commerce growth, store openings (handful of units  2015), remodelling program (12 expected in 2015, 50 in 2016, and 75 in 2017),  and expansion of its beauty presence. Kohl's provided the breakdown for capex as  follows: $350 million for IT spending, $250 million for store strategies  including new stores, remodel, beauty and other Easy Experience initiatives, and  $200 million for base capital projects. Fitch expects FCF to be directed toward  share buybacks. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch's expects overall top-line growth to be in the positive 1.5%-2.0% range,  which reflects flat-to modestly negative store level comps growth and online  sales growth in the mid-teens that would contribute roughly 150 bps to overall  comps. --Kohl's annual EBITDA is expected to stabilize in the $2.6 billion - $2.7  billion range and adjusted debt/EBITDAR to be in the 2.3x range over the next  two to three years, modestly above the company's currently stated leverage  target of 2.0x-2.25x. --Fitch expects FCF to be in the $700 million range annually over the next 24  -36 months, a decline from the $950 million to $1 billion level, reflecting a  ramp up in capital expenditures to the $800 million range and assuming working  capital swings are neutral. RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action is unlikely at this time as Fitch anticipates Kohl's  will manage its capital structure to its publicly stated target 2.0x-2.25x  consolidated debt/EBITDAR leverage using 8.0x net rent expense.  A negative rating action could result in the event of one or more of the  following: --If retail store comps fail to stabilize and overall comps (including online  sales) do not improve to a level of 1.5% or better in the next 12-24 months. --A weakening profitability profile (where EBITDA drops to below $2.6 billion)  and/or a more aggressive financial posture that would take leverage above 2.5x. Fitch has affirmed Kohl's ratings as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'BBB+'; --$1 billion bank credit facility at 'BBB+; --Senior unsecured notes and debentures at 'BBB+'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative.

Some experts fear that Canadian homes, particularly in the hot markets of Toronto and Vancouver, have become overpriced. This measure from Statistics Canada does not include apartments or condominiums.

42,"  Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) estimated quarterly sales below analysts' expectations, citing unseasonably warm weather and intense competition, and said it would speed up closure of at least 50 unprofitable stores in the next few months.The struggling retailer's shares were down 7.8 percent at $15.42 in afternoon trading on Tuesday.A warmer-than-expected winter in 2015 dented sales of cold-weather apparel and goods in the United States, forcing retailers such as Macy's Inc (M.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) to warn of disappointing sales for the period.November and December are crucial for many retailers as the two months can account for anywhere between 20-40 percent of annual sales.Sears estimated sales of $7.3 billion for the three months ended Jan. 31, below the $7.43 billion analysts on average had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sears said it planned to cut costs by $550 million-$650 million in 2016, depending on overall volume of sales, adding that it targeted at least $300 million in asset sales during the first half of the year. Sears said it was still exploring the sale of its auto center business, which it has been looking to sell since 2013.The company also estimated a net loss of $525-$625 million in the fourth quarter. Sears said it expected to write down the value of its brand by $150-$200 million as a result of store closures and falling revenue.Once the largest retailer in the United States, Sears has lost its standing as customers preferred to either shop online or at rivals such as Target Corp (TGT.N) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N).The company is working to cut costs by creating a real estate investment trust Seritage Growth Properties (SRG.N), shutting stores and cutting jobs. The company reported a 7.1 percent drop in sales at established stores during the holiday quarter, hurt by weak demand for apparel - a business that has a ""substantial impact"" on overall profitability.Sears said it expects to report fourth quarter results around Feb. 25.

Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) joined Macy's Inc (M.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) in reporting a drop in total sales in a quarter marked by weak demand for apparel - at their stores, at least.The department store operator also reported a surprise drop in sales at stores open at least a year, the first fall in six quarters for a company that has been a bright spot in a sector struggling with a shift in spending patterns.J.C. Penney's shares fell as much as 13 percent in premarket trading, but recovered most of that after the market opened as investors focused on the company retaining its full-year forecast for same-store sales growth and adjusted profit. ""JCP is making the right investments in home and appliances to try to mitigate consumer malaise toward apparel,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell wrote in a note, adding that the company had multiple drivers to return to sustainable comparable sales growth, unlike other retailers.Investors were also encouraged by the fact that the 0.4 percent fall in same-store sales reported by J.C. Penney was not as steep as those suffered by its rivals.    Shoppers are increasingly spending more on purchases such as electronics, homes, travel and cars than on apparel, a major source of revenue for department stores.Current spending trends are likely to continue in the near term, J.C. Penney's chief financial officer, Ed Record, said on a call with analysts.Chief Executive Marvin Ellison also cited warmer-than-expected weather in February as a negative factor.""Our over-reliance on apparel hurt us in times during the first quarter when weather patterns were not conducive to apparel sales,"" Ellison said. However, the company said sales started picking up in the last two weeks of April and early May.U.S. retail sales in April recorded their biggest increase in a year as Americans stepped up purchases of automobiles and a range of other goods, the Commerce Department reported on Friday.And sales at clothing stores surged 1.0 percent, the biggest increase since May 2015, the data showed.J.C. Penney's shares were down about 1 percent at $7.70 in morning trading. BIG MISS ON SAME-STORE SALES The 0.4 percent fall in sales at J.C. Penney stores open at least a year came as a shock. Analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had expected a rise of 3.3 percent.Still, Penney outperformed Macy's, Kohl's and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) on that measure. Same-store sales at Macy's, the biggest U.S. department store operator, fell 5.6 percent while those at Kohl's dropped 3.9 percent and Nordstrom's slipped 1.7 percent.J.C. Penney's net loss more than halved to $68 million, or 22 cents per share, in the first quarter ended April 30.      But net sales fell 1.6 percent to $2.81 billion, the first drop in five quarters. Sales also missed the average analyst estimate of $2.92 billion.J.C.

65,"  Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by better inventory management and warm weather that boosted sales of summer clothes and accessories.The department store chain's shares rose 9 percent to $41.50 in premarket trading on Thursday. Shares of rival Macy's Inc (M.N), which also reports quarterly results on Thursday, were up 4.4 percent.Shares of department store operators, which are struggling with stiff competition from online and off-price retailers, have been under pressure in the past year.The upbeat results follow a disastrous first quarter, when Kohl's sales fell for the first time in six quarters.The store chain, which largely caters to low- to middle-income customers, has been cutting costs by closing underperforming stores this year. It is also focusing on inventory reduction and speeding up lead times for getting merchandise to stores.The warm weather in the quarter also helped, boosting traffic in malls and helping department stores clear inventory from the previous quarter. The company said on Thursday its inventory management initiatives helped boost gross margins to 39.5 percent from 38.9 percent in the second quarter ended July 30.Kohl's ended the quarter with significantly lower inventory per store compared with last year.Sales at Kohl's stores open at least a year fell 1.8 percent, down for the second straight quarter. Analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had on average forecast a 1.7 percent drop.

66,"   By Noel Randewich  All three major U.S. stock indexes closed at record highs on Thursday for the first time since 1999 as surging oil prices and strong earnings from department stores Macy's and Kohl's buoyed investor sentiment.It was the first time since Dec. 31, 1999 that the S&P 500, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq had closed at record highs on the same day, according to Bespoke Investment Group.Crude oil jumped as much as 5 percent on comments from the Saudi oil minister about potential action to stabilize prices and an International Energy Agency forecast that crude oil markets would rebalance in the next few months. The S&P energy index .SPNY rallied 1.3 percent, making it the top gainer among the 10 major sectors, led by a 1.26 percent rise in Chevron (CVX.N).Macy's (M.N) shares soared 17.09 percent, marking the best day for the department store operator in nearly eight years after it reported a smaller-than-expected drop in quarterly comparable-store sales and said it would close 100 stores.Kohl's (KSS.N) shares rose 16.17 percent after its quarterly profit beat estimates. J.C. Penney (JCP.N), which reports on Friday, surged 8.63 percent. A stock market rally since late June has pushed the S&P 500 index .SPX up 7.0 percent in 2016, helped by better-than-expected quarterly earnings and low interest rates, but some investors are worried about high valuations.Beating its previous record high from last Friday, the S&P 500 is priced at about 17 times expected earnings, compared with a 10-year average of 14 times expected earnings, according to Thomson Reuters data.""I'm a bit surprised to see us hitting record highs again,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin. ""We are pretty topped out and we should move sideways for a while."" Robust U.S. economic data also helped on Thursday, with a report showing the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell to 266,000 from 269,000 the previous week. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI climbed 0.64 percent to end at 18,613.52 and the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.47 percent to 2,185.79.The Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.46 percent to 5,228.40.While the Dow and S&P 500 have hit record highs in tandem in recent years, the Nasdaq went 15 years without hitting a new high before 2015. The Nasdaq surpassed its 2015 record high close last Friday. In slow trade, about 5.98 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the 6.43 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.Alibaba (BABA.N) rose 5.08 percent after the Chinese e-commerce company posted a 59 percent jump in quarterly revenue.Valeant (VRX.N) dropped 10.36 percent after the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. federal prosecutors had opened a criminal investigation on the drugmaker.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.63-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.76-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 34 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 97 new highs and 29 new lows.

68,"  Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by better inventory management and warm weather that boosted sales of summer clothes and accessories.The department store chain's shares rose 9 percent to $41.50 in premarket trading on Thursday. Shares of rival Macy's Inc (M.N), which also reports quarterly results on Thursday, were up 4.4 percent.Shares of department store operators, which are struggling with stiff competition from online and off-price retailers, have been under pressure in the past year.The upbeat results follow a disastrous first quarter, when Kohl's sales fell for the first time in six quarters.The store chain, which largely caters to low- to middle-income customers, has been cutting costs by closing underperforming stores this year. It is also focusing on inventory reduction and speeding up lead times for getting merchandise to stores.The warm weather in the quarter also helped, boosting traffic in malls and helping department stores clear inventory from the previous quarter. The company said on Thursday its inventory management initiatives helped boost gross margins to 39.5 percent from 38.9 percent in the second quarter ended July 30.Kohl's ended the quarter with significantly lower inventory per store compared with last year.Sales at Kohl's stores open at least a year fell 1.8 percent, down for the second straight quarter. Analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had on average forecast a 1.7 percent drop. Kohl's net income rose 7.7 percent to $140 million, or 77 cents per share, in the quarter, from $130 million, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned $1.22 per share.

More than 14,000 seasonal positions were transitioned to regular, full-time roles after the holidays last year, and the company expects to increase that number this year, Amazon said on Thursday. The U.S. National Retail Federation earlier this month forecast a 3.6 percent rise in holiday sales this year, with online sales expected to climb 7 percent to 10 percent.U.S. brick-and-mortar retailers' biggest challenge in recent years has been tackling the growth of online retailers, specially Amazon, which offer the same products at lower prices and have made shopping more convenient. They are also keeping sales expectations and inventories low - and hiring light - ahead of the holiday season to avoid a repeat of last year, when unusually warm weather hit sales and piled up unsold goods.

78,"   By Siddharth Cavale and Gayathree Ganesan  Macy's Inc (M.N) and Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) struck an optimistic note going into the holiday shopping season, giving a rare boost to shares of department store operators, which have struggled to grow in the face of intense competition from online retailers.Macy's Inc (M.N) shares were up 6.8 percent and Kohl's 13.4 percent after upbeat comments that accompanied their otherwise lackluster quarterly results on Thursday.Shares of Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N), which reports later on Thursday, were up 8 percent while those of J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N), reporting on Friday, were up 7.7 percent.Kohl's Chief Executive Kevin Mansell said he was encouraged by a strong back-to-school season and sales during October.Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren was also upbeat.""Our third-quarter top-line results were better than the first half of the year and our sales-driving initiatives continue to gain traction,"" he said.Macy's, which also formed a partnership with Brookfield Asset Management to look at ways it can cash in on the value of its real estate, said total sales for the full year would be better than the 2 percent decline it had previously estimated. ""The trends we saw in the third quarter give us confidence that we can deliver our expectations for the fourth quarter and our guidance for fiscal 2016,"" Lundgren said in a statement.Strengthening trends in Macy's apparel businesses, coupled with initiatives related to Apple Inc (AAPL.O) watches, handbags from Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS.N) and others, will help performance in the current quarter, he added.Macy's said that Brookfield would have exclusive rights to create pre-development plans for about 50 Macy's real estate assets, including owned and leased stores and associated land. UNDER PRESSURE The partnership, which is for up to two years, is the latest move by Macy's to squeeze more value from its vast real estate holdings across the United States.The company, under pressure from activist investor Starboard Value LP, is already exploring options for its flagship stores, including its famous Herald Square store in New York.Macy's has also said it plans to close about 100 stores, or about 14 percent of the total, representing annual net sales volume of about $1 billion. U.S. department store operators have been struggling to grow in the face of intense competition from online retailers, especially Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).Macy's net sales fell 4.2 percent in the latest quarter while Kohl's sales dropped 2.3 percent.Macy's same-store sales on an owned plus licensed basis fell 2.7 percent - but that was better than the 3.4 percent fall expected by analysts polled by consultancy Consensus Metrix.Kohl's same-store fell 1.7 percent, more than the 1.4 percent analysts had expected.But while Macy's net profit fell 85 percent, mainly due to a pension-related charge, Kohl's profit rose 21.7 percent. Both retailers have been closing stores and looking for other ways to cut costs as shoppers spend more on pricey things such as holidays and home improvement items and less on apparel, which accounts for most of their sales.Macy's sales have also been hit by a strong dollar, which has affected tourist spending at the company's U.S. stores, which include Bloomingdale's.Unlike Kohl's, Macy's has been focusing on its huge real estate holdings as a way to shore up its business.Since the beginning of 2015, the retailer has announced or completed asset sales with anticipated proceeds of more than $800 million.In its latest deals, Macy's said on Thursday it had signed a contract to sell its Union Square Men's building in San Francisco for $250 million and its downtown Portland, Oregon store for $54 million.Under the deal with Brookfield, the asset manager will create plans for real estate assets mostly in or near malls.""While we might close stores in some of these locations, it is more likely that we will create value with surplus land or through improvements alongside an existing store,"" Macy's Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said on a call with analysts.""This (partnership) should give us insight into the potential of our total portfolio,"" she said.Macy's said it now expected full-year comparable sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis to decrease 2.5-3.0 percent this year, an improvement on its prior forecast for a fall of 3-4 percent.Up to Wednesday's close of $38.38, Macy's shares had risen 9.7 percent this year. Kohl's shares, which closed at $45.70 on Wednesday, had gained 4.1 percent.
