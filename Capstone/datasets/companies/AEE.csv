0,"  (Adds company comment, details from regulatory filing, context on smelter and company)NEW YORK, June 2 Noranda Aluminum Holding Corp  will have to seek a new power supplier or negotiate a new contract with Ameren Corp in five years to keep its Missouri smelter running, the latest obstacle for its only primary aluminum plant.Energy provider Ameren's Missouri division told Noranda last Thursday it will not extend a power contract for its smelter in New Madrid after the current contract expires in 2020, Noranda said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.That was the five years' notice needed to avoid an automatic one-year renewal.The notice comes just one month after Missouri's state regulator approved a reduced power rate for the 253,000 tonne-per-year smelter, which Ameren Missouri had fought. The news comes just as Noranda prepares to fight an attempt by the government of Jamaica to prevent it from exporting bauxite from the island due to a dispute over taxes related to a mine it owns on the island.Noranda had previously threatened to shutter the Missouri smelter, which accounts for more than 14 percent of overall U.S.  aluminum output, if a favorable deal had not been reached. It is Ameren's biggest customer in the state.The two sides had initially reached the agreement in December 2004. ""The lifeblood of a smelter is a sustainable power contract,"" Noranda spokesman John Parker said on Tuesday.Noranda believes Ameren Missouri is still obligated to supply power to the smelter even if the contract runs out because it is located within the power company's service area designated by the state. ""We don't believe their notice in itself changes its obligation to provide us power.""Parker declined to specify any potential alternative sources of power, but noted that the smelter is located along the Midcontinent Independent System Operator grid and could be supplied by other power companies.In the filing, Noranda said it may seek to negotiate a new agreement with Ameren over the next five years or seek to enter into an agreement with another electric power provider.Parker noted that the Ameren notice would have no immediate impact on business.

2,"  (Adds sector background, details on power deal)NEW YORK, July 22 Noranda Aluminum Holding Co  has delayed efforts to ramp up production at its New Madrid, Missouri, smelter due to a sharp decline in aluminum prices, President and CEO Kip Smith said on Wednesday, as the company's quarterly losses widened.The company had previously expected the 253,000 tonne-per-year smelter to reach full capacity by the third quarter.It is currently operating at about 85 percent of capacity, down from 90 percent in May, Smith said on a conference call to discuss the company's second-quarter earnings.""The economics of ramping up production changed,"" Smith said, noting that the company would focus on achieving ""operating stability"" and ""prudently"" increasing production at the smelter through the fourth quarter of 2015.The company announced a loss of 25 cents a share for the second quarter, compared with an eight-cent loss in the same period of 2014. Smith said ""reliability issues"" at the smelter during the second quarter limited its production and cost the company 8 cents per pound. He has previously blamed higher-than-expected pot line outages for the slower ramp-up.The caution in bringing on new capacity is the latest sign of the pain felt across the global industry as prices on the London Metal Exchange remain below cost of production for a big portion of the world's smelters. Alcoa Inc and Rusal  have both cut output in recent years.Prices have plunged 20 percent since September and were at $1,657 per tonne on Wednesday afternoon. Premiums AL-PREM, which are paid on top of the benchmark LME price for physical delivery, have also fallen at an unprecedented rate this year, further hurting smelters' margins.Executives said they had no update on the strategic review announced last month. The slow ramp-up is the latest headache for Noranda's only primary aluminum smelter after a dispute with its power supplier Ameren Corp over electricity rates earlier in the year.The issue was resolved in April after the Missouri state regulator forced Ameren to lower Noranda's power prices by 14 percent.Ameren has informed the company that it does not intend to extend the current power contract after it expires in 2020, meaning Noranda will either have to negotiate a new contract or find a different provider to keep the smelter running.(Reporting By Luc Cohen; Editing by Peter Galloway and Andrew Hay)",2015-07-22,AEE,"Wed Jul 22, 2015 | 12:56pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Noranda delays smelter ramp-up due to aluminum price rout,http://www.reuters.com//article/noranda-aluminum-smelter-idUSL1N10215320150722?type=companyNews
3,"  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said on Monday it has begun a special inspection at Ameren Corp's 1,190 MW Callaway nuclear plant in Missouri to review the failure of control valves following a reactor shutdown on Aug. 11.Three of four control valves that regulate water flow to steam generators in the reactor failed to work properly following the shutdown, the agency said.NRC inspectors are expected to spend about a week on site investigating issues relating to testing, maintenance, design and corrective actions of the valves. A report with the team's findings will be released within 45 days of the end of the inspection.
