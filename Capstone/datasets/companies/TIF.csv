0,"  (Adds analysts' comments, background; updates share movement)By Devika  Krishna KumarJan 10 U.S. jeweler Tiffany & Co kept its full-year earnings forecast unchanged, disappointing investors after reporting a strong jump in U.S. holiday season sales.The company's shares fell as much as 2.5 percent after it maintained its adjusted profit forecast of $3.65-$3.75 per share for the year ending Jan. 31.""We believe the market was probably looking for a stronger earnings guide based on recent fundamental momentum,"" Jefferies & Co analysts wrote in a note.Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said investors were also disappointed with flat growth in same-store sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Growth in the region had driven the company's sales growth in the past year amid sluggish sales in the Americas.Tiffany's recovery in the United States, its biggest market, came after two years of struggle to find the right mix of the expensive jewelry for which it is known and cheaper silver items that generate a quarter of sales. The company, known for its blue boxes and its Fifth Avenue flagship store in Manhattan, reported a 7 percent rise in same-store sales in the Americas for the holiday shopping season ended Dec. 31.Overall net worldwide sales rose 8 percent during November and December, excluding currency fluctuations. Including foreign exchange fluctuations, sales rose 4 percent.Lower-end peer Zale Corp reported a 2 percent rise in comparable-store sales for the same period, driven by higher sales at its Zales Jewelers and Zales Outlet stores. Zale shares rose as much as 19.5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.While Tiffany has maintained its forecast, other large retailers have slashed theirs due to steep discounts.Signet Jewelers Ltd , the largest U.S. jeweler, estimated its fourth-quarter profit below analysts' expectations on Thursday as increased promotions hurt margins. ""Tiffany was able to overcome the traffic challenges of other mall retailers based on the strength of its assortments -and despite its lack of discounting,"" Dorothy Lakner of Topeka Capital Markets wrote in a note.Yarbrough said the company's launch of cheaper silver jewelry and increased marketing and advertising efforts boosted sales in the Americas.""We'll have to wait and see if this translates into 2014 or if this is just a holiday period revival,"" Yarbrough said.Tiffany shares were down 2 percent at $90.30 on Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.Zale shares were up 13 percent at $16.06, while Signet shares were down 2 percent at $71.93.

Tiffany said sales in the Americas, which accounts for nearly half of total revenue, rose 6 percent in the two months ended December 31.

3,"  * Third-quarter sales up 9 pct at constant currencies* Analysts in poll had expected 11.9 pct rise* Company says wholesale retailers in Asia still cautious   (Adds comments by analysts, further details, share price)By Silke KoltrowitzZURICH Jan 16 Luxury goods group Richemont  maintained the pace of its sales growth in the last three months, it reported on Thursday, as demand for its IWC watches, Cartier jewellery and other brands in its retail outlets more than offset a still subdued wholesale business.Richemont's total global sales in the last three months rose 9 percent at constant exchange rates or 3 percent at actual rates to 2.941 billion euros ($4 billion). Sales for the first nine months were also up 9 percent at 8.265 billion francs, a 4 percent rise based on actual exchange rates.Growth in the wholesaling business in the third quarter of only 3 percent at constant exchange rates, was well below the 14 percent growth seen in its steadily expanding retail operation, reflecting caution amongst business partners particularly in the Asia Pacific region, Richemont said.Sellers of luxury products like Richemont are grappling with weak demand in China, where the government's anti-bribery campaign has hit conspicuous consumption and gift-giving, with overall Swiss watch exports to China down 15 percent in the first 11 months of last year. Citi analyst Thomas Chauvet said the lack of comment on the outlook in Richemont's trading statement on Thursday would weigh on the shares that nose-dived in December after cautious comments on the global economy by main shareholder Johann Rupert, but recovered after peer Swatch Group's upbeat outlook last week.The shares were down 1.8 percent at 86.95 Swiss francs by 1114 GMT, after dropping as much as 4 percent in early trade, valuing the shares at 17 times forward earnings, a premium to Swatch at 16.1 times and LVMH at 16.3 times.But J.Safra Sarasin analyst Patrick Hasenboehler said the shares were still attractively valued in light of the growth potential and cash generation. Swatch said last week it expected double-digit sales growth in 2014 after sales rose 9.1 percent in 2013, while U.S. jeweller Tiffany took a rather cautious stance despite strong U.S. holiday sales.""Richemont missed expectations ... but compared with peers, its performance still shines,"" said Zuercher KB analyst Patrik Schwendimann, who rates the stock a 'buy'. He noted that  Tiffany's sales grew 8 percent in November and December, while Swatch only had organic growth of 5.2 percent in the second half.Richemont said sales in the Americas were up 12 percent in the third quarter, at constant exchange rates, driven by robust retail demand in particular for jewellery and at the group's online retailer Net-a-Porter, while sales in Europe and the Middle East were up 9 percent on strong demand from tourist shoppers.Sales in Asia Pacific, which ranks marginally above Europe and the Middle East as its biggest market by region, were up just 6 percent with lower sales in mainland China being the main drag, the company said.But Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox said it was just a matter of time before independent Chinese retailers started re-ordering again. ""We are closer to dawn than dusk in China,"" he said.

4,"  (Adds details from conference call)By Phil WahbaMarch 21 Tiffany & Co forecast more sales growth this year amid signs that the jeweler's business in its home U.S. market is finally perking up.The retailer, known for its Robin egg blue boxes and Fifth Avenue flagship store in Manhattan, said on Friday that it expects global net sales, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, to rise by a ""high-single"" digit percentage this year, after climbing 10 percent last year.Shares rose 2.7 percent to $93.64 in morning trading.Tiffany reported a companywide 6 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year for the fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 31.The New York-based jewelry chain has had sluggish sales in the last year in the United States, where many shoppers, particularly its more frugal customers, spent less.Specifically, the company has struggled with sales of silver jewelry and items costing less than $500, which have a higher profit margin than more expensive jewelry and account for a quarter of its sales. That trend started to abate during the holiday quarter, and comparable sales in the Americas rose 7 percent, prompting a Tiffany spokesman to say on a conference call that the company was ""encouraged."" It was the fastest pace of growth by far for fiscal 2013 in the region.""They could finally be starting to turn the corner,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough.Last year, Tiffany hired a new design director, Francesca Amfitheatrof, in part to improve its lower-price assortment, and Yarbrough said there were signs that category was starting to catch on with shoppers. She had developed jewelry for fashion brands, including Chanel, Fendi and Marni, prior to joining Tiffany At its Fifth Avenue store, which accounts for 8 percent of sales, an increase in tourism from China and higher spending by European visitors boosted sales. The store gets almost half of its sales from foreign visitors. Other U.S. stores saw modest sales gains after stagnating earlier in the year.Tiffany said that its pricey fine jewelry led its sales growth worldwide.Comparable store sales rose 4 percent in Asia, excluding Japan, led by gains in China, where Tiffany has been focusing much of its expansion. Sales had been tepid in the region in November and December, but business picked up in January, partly helped by the earlier timing of Chinese New Year.In Europe, sales rose 2 percent while in Japan comparable sales rose 8 percent, excluding a sharp drop in the value of the yen. Overall sales rose 5.1 percent to $1.3 billion.Tiffany also forecast a profit of $4.05 to $4.15 per share this fiscal year, below Wall Street estimates for $4.28 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Analysts said that after a painful 2012, when Tiffany lowered its bullish profit forecasts four times, the company has grown more cautious in its projections.The upscale New York-based jeweler reported a loss of $103.6 million, or 81 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, due primarily to losing an arbitrations ruling against Swatch Group . A year earlier, it recorded a profit of $179.6 million, or $1.40 a share.Excluding the arbitration loss, which wiped out more than half of its 2013 profit, Tiffany earned $1.47 per share in the quarter, 5 cents below Wall Street expectations.Tiffany is slowing its store expansion, increasing its fleet by nine stores in 2014, after 14 last year, a move hailed by Oppenheimer & Co analyst Brian Nagel in a research note.

5,"   By Phil Wahba  Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) struck a cautious note on Friday about 2014, giving a profit forecast that was below estimates despite its projection that net worldwide sales would rise by a high-single digit percentage this year.The company, which has bet its growth on emerging markets such as China and Russia, is likely being conservative because of growing economic and political uncertainty in some markets, and still sluggish growth of its less expensive silver jewelry in the United States, analysts said.Tiffany, known for its blue boxes and Fifth Avenue flagship store in Manhattan, forecast a profit of $4.05 to $4.15 per share this fiscal year. Wall Street analysts projected $4.28 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.After a painful 2012, when Tiffany lowered its bullish profit forecasts four times, the company has grown more cautious in its projections.But this time, growing uncertainty in emerging markets was likely a factor too, said Edward Yruma, a KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst.""They are being prudent given what's going in Russia and China,"" Yruma said. The New York-based jewelry chain reported a 6 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year for the fourth quarter ended January 31.The company reported growth in all regions, including the United States, where it has struggled to find the right mix of expensive jewelry and more affordable silver items that generate one-quarter of sales.But U.S. sales outside of its Manhattan flagship were slower, suggesting its less expensive jewelry, items that cost less than $500 but offer a higher profit margin, are taking some time to catch on with frugal shoppers, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. Tiffany said that companywide, its fine jewelry led its sales growth.Last year, Tiffany hired a new design director, Francesca Amfitheatrof, in part to improve its lower-price assortment.Comparable store sales rose 4 percent in Asia, excluding Japan, led by gains in China, where Tiffany has been focusing much of its expansion. Sales had been tepid in the region in November and December, suggesting an uptick in January.

Russia's MICEX stock index fell about 3 percent but recovered some losses. While some analysts say U.S. equities are vulnerable to any escalation in geopolitical tensions with Russia, stocks were boosted by Moscow's assertion that no other Ukrainian region would be subject to intervention.""The path of least resistance for markets is up, and so far it doesn't think the Ukraine issue is too big of a negative since no one really thinks that Putin will do anything too drastic,"" said Michael Matousek, head trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc in San Antonio. ""Of course if things do heat up, it would really become a headwind for markets.""Companies tied to the pace of economic growth were among the biggest gainers Friday, with energy and industrial shares rallying. Joy Global Inc jumped 3 percent to $56.79 while Halliburton Co was up 1.4 percent to $58.19. On the downside, Nike Inc late Thursday said growing pressures from weak emerging market currencies would take a toll on its profit. The athletic apparel maker, which gets about 30 percent of revenue from emerging markets, also said China sales would be unchanged or slightly down this quarter. Shares fell 3 percent to $76.82.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 46.21 points, or 0.28 percent, at 16,377.26. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  was up 5.21 points, or 0.28 percent, at 1,877.22. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 20.27 points, or 0.47 percent, at 4,299.02.The S&P 500 briefly climbed to a record high of 1,883.97, just barely over its previous record of 1,883.57. If the index's current levels hold, that would represent a record close. For the week, both the Dow and S&P are up 2 percent while the Nasdaq is up 1.4 percent.Symantec Corp shares weighed on the Nasdaq, tumbling 13 percent to $18.16 a day after it fired Chief Executive Steve Bennett, the second time it has sacked its top executive in less than two years. WellPoint Inc raised its earnings outlook, saying it expected strong membership growth. Shares rose 1.1 percent to $100.81.Despite recent strength, volume has been anemic on positive market days, suggesting limited conviction behind the move. However, volume is expected to surge on Friday as options expire alongside multiple index rebalances. Credit Suisse estimates $14 billion in gross trading from the S&P 500 index rebalance, with another $6 billion from rebalancing in other indexes.In earnings news, Tiffany & Co reported adjusted fourth-quarter earnings and gave a profit outlook that were below estimates. However, shares rose 2.3 percent to $93.23. Darden Restaurants Inc reported third-quarter results largely in line with expectations and affirmed its plan to divest its Red Lobster business. Shares rose 2.6 percent to $50.61.Lin Media LLC jumped 21 percent to $25.98. Media General Inc agreed to buy the company for $1.6 billion. Media General jumped 6.1 percent to $18.39.The U.S. Federal Reserve late Thursday said big U.S. banks have enough capital buffers to withstand a drastic economic downturn. The central bank said 29 out of 30 major banks met the minimum hurdle in its annual health check.The only bank to fall under the 5 percent requirement for top-tier capital was Zion Bancorp, which said it would resubmit a capital plan to the Fed. Shares of Zion fell 2.4 percent to $32.20.

The Fed will release the minutes from its late-April meeting at 2:00 p.m. (1800 GMT), when the central bank looked past a dismal reading on first-quarter U.S. growth and gave a mostly upbeat assessment of the economy's prospects as it announced another cut in its massive bond-buying stimulus.""I suspect they are going to continue this low interest rate environment, very accommodative monetary policy, for a very long period of time in an effort to help markets feel a little bit calmer as it relates to a hike in interest rates,"" said Joseph Tanious, global market strategist at J.P.

13,"  (Adds analyst comments, details; updates shares)By Devika  Krishna KumarMay 21 Tiffany & Co raised its full-year profit forecast after the jewelry chain reported better-than-expected quarterly results as new collections drove sales in the United States, its biggest market.Shares of Tiffany, known for its blue boxes and its Fifth Avenue flagship store in Manhattan, rose as much as 10 percent on Wednesday morning, making the stock one of the top percentage gainers on the New York Stock Exchange.Tiffany has been struggling for the past two years to find the right balance between the pricey jewelry for which it is known and cheaper silver items that generate a quarter of sales.Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said Tiffany's U.S. business had lagged other regions for several quarters, mainly as it was weak in lower-priced silver jewelry category.""Strength in fine and statement jewelry sales continued, while sales of our new or expanded jewelry collections accelerated, led by our ATLAS collection,"" Chief Executive Michael Kowalski said in a statement. Tiffany's fine jewelry is priced a few thousand dollars, while statement jewelry pieces can go as high as $50,000 and above.The Atlas Collection is a new range that focuses on silver jewelry - including lariats, rings and pendants - priced below $500. Tiffany's profit margin in these pieces is higher than in expensive jewelry.The company's Fifth Avenue store, which accounts for 8 percent of its overall sales, has benefited as more tourists visit the marquee store and spend more on jewelry.International visitors to the United States spent $15.4 billion in March, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Yarbrough said Tiffany was now seeing broad-based strength in the country, whereas growth earlier was led by its Fifth Avenue store.""They're gaining acceptance outside of just tourists,"" he said.Tiffany, which is usually cautious in its outlook, said earnings would be flat in the current quarter. The company raised its earnings forecast for the year ending Jan. 31 to $4.15-$4.25 per share from $4.05-$4.15 per share.Comparable-store sales in the Americas, which account for nearly half of Tiffany's overall sales, rose 8 percent excluding currency fluctuations in the first quarter ended April 30.Net profit rose 50 percent to $125.6 million, or 97 cents per share, while total sales rose 15 percent to $1 billion on a constant-currency basis.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 78 cents per share on sales of $956.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Company-wide sales at stores open at least a year rose 11 percent on a constant-currency basis in the first quarter.Tiffany's shares were up 9.8 percent at $96.88 in late morning trading on Wednesday.

20,"  * Industry worried about mixing synthetic with natural diamonds* Israel Diamond Exchange has banned synthetics* Production of synthetics still small but growing* Tiffany's invests heavily in protecting its productsBy Ari RabinovitchTEL AVIV, July 31 Diamonds are a girl's best friend - but only if they are natural.That is the message mining companies and luxury jewellers are keen to instill in consumers as the diamond trade faces a growing challenge from the production of synthetic diamonds.Global diamond jewellery sales are worth more than $72 billion a year, according to the World Diamond Council, and jewellers like Tiffany and diamond miners led by De Beers stress that a jewel mined at great expense, and often with great risk, is infinitely more valuable than one made by man.But it can be hard to tell the difference.Synthetic diamonds can be manufactured in a laboratory to the extent that they have the same properties as natural ones, raising the risk that a synthetic product could one day inadvertently end up in a luxury jeweller's showroom.""God help the major diamond jeweller, be it Cartier, Tiffany, Van Cleef, anybody, who puts a piece of jewellery out there and it's later found to be having synthetic diamonds in it without disclosure. That fear is what's driving the industry,"" said Martin Rapaport, chairman of the Rapaport Group, which is the primary source of diamond price information around the world.Synthetic diamond production is still small: annual output of gem-quality rough synthetic diamonds is less than 350,000 carats, a fraction of the 125 million carats of natural gem-quality rough, according to India's Natural Diamond Monitoring Committee.Synthetic diamonds are legitimate and are increasingly used for industrial purposes, and higher quality lab-produced diamonds are used in jewellery. What worries the industry is their use in natural diamond jewellery without disclosure.Tiffany says it is confident it is not at risk of inadvertently selling synthetic diamonds.""We do not and will not sell non-mined diamonds. Tiffany's insistence on only the highest standards produces diamonds that are of the utmost beauty,"" the company told Reuters in a statement.But the diamond industry is stepping up action and technology to ward against the mixing of synthetics and natural diamonds in the market.In a corner of the trading floor on the Israel Diamond Exchange, one of the world's largest diamond markets, in Ramat Gan near Tel Aviv, a worker operates a new machine developed by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA), offering to test any diamond if a buyer is unsure of its origin. ""We have to be very cautious. Very, very cautious, and check. Not go according to our expertise only. We have to use this machinery,"" said Shmuel Schnitzer, president of the exchange.The exchange has banned synthetics from its trading floor since last year and adopted the slogan ""Natural is Real"" for its advertising and marketing.If someone is caught peddling undeclared synthetics?""He's finished. Because the main thing here at our business is trust,"" said Schnitzer.De Beers, owned by Anglo American and the world's largest supplier of rough diamonds by value, has just developed an Automated Melee Screening instrument that can test large parcels of small diamonds at a rate of 360 stones per hour.""I think we put a good number of measures in place. We've been developing a lot of technology in order to assist the marketplace in identifying synthetics,"" said Paul Rowley, executive vice president in charge of sales at De Beers.Depending on who you ask, synthetic diamonds trade at a 20 to 50 percent discount to the natural stones.While they are unlikely to ever fetch the same price as natural diamonds, synthetics are here to stay, said diamond consultant Edahn Golan. ""Their introduction into the market in a major way is inevitable. Right now it's a trickle,"" Golan said.In the past two years reports have popped up of undisclosed mixing, breeding a level of mistrust within the diamond supply chain.Chemically, physically and optically the two kinds of diamonds are the same, said Tom Moses, chief laboratory and research officer at the GIA, which grades and evaluates diamonds.The only thing differentiating them is how they are formed - one underground over a couple billion years, the other in a lab over two to three days.The GIA has discovered undeclared lab-grown diamonds, Moses said, but ""fortunately, it's a very small number of instances"".Rapaport, however, cites a case in China when someone obtained an authentic GIA grading report of an existing diamond and created a synthetic diamond to match it exactly.ULTIMATE GIFT  The industry has experience of having to protect the market. Conflict diamonds, or ""blood diamonds"", whereby production in countries such as Angola or Sierra Leone among others has been used to fund violent conflict or involves human rights abuses, have been a particular problem.International pressure on governments and the diamond industry to take action to eliminate conflict diamonds from international trade has had some success although the problem has not been wiped out entirely. Tackling the undisclosed mixing of synthetic diamonds may be an even bigger challenge because the product is so sophisticated.""How can you trust your supplier? What is your supply chain like? The issue isn't just if the diamonds are involved in human rights abuses anymore,"" Rapaport said. ""This whole idea of trust within the industry, this is now being raised to a much higher level than it ever was before.""One case that caused a stir was in 2012 when the lab of the International Gemological Institute -  a certifier of diamonds like the GIA - in Antwerp uncovered in a parcel of about 1,000 small diamonds believed to be natural, that more than 600 were man-made.And they were not ""ordinary"" synthetics, but included ""impurities, which were apparently intentionally introduced in the synthetic production process not to make the stone more beautiful but solely to make the stone look more natural,"" the institute said.Lisa Bissell, chief executive at New York-based Pure Grown Diamonds, a leading distributor of lab-produced diamonds for jewellery, said the synthetic diamond sector is still in its infancy. Her company recently changed its name from Gemesis to highlight that its stones were synthetic not natural.""Differentiation or disclosure is the base of the diamond industry, of which we all are equal participants,"" she said.Part of the appeal of lab-produced diamonds, she said, is that consumers can be sure they are buying diamonds that are ""sustainable, certified, and conflict-free"".Traders of natural diamonds say sentiment will always set their product apart.""We are very much of the opinion that there is a huge difference between the two. Very much from an emotional value perspective,"" said De Beers' Rowley.The industry's response to cases of nondisclosure has been ""robust"", bringing them quickly into the limelight, he said.De Beers itself is involved in synthetic diamond production, strictly for industrial use. It owns Element Six, which makes synthetics for uses such as synthetic diamond sensors in radiation therapy and synthetic diamond cutters for oil and gas drilling, saying the stone's exceptional hardness compared with other materials and its high resistance to thermal shock, among other properties, make it an ideal industrial material.Tiffany says it invests heavily to ensure there is no confusion about the purity of its diamonds.""We do not have any evidence that non-mined diamonds are affecting our sales in any way,"" the company told Reuters in a statement. ""We have always led the industry by grading our own diamonds and have invested in our sourcing, our supply chain and technology to ensure that the diamonds sold in Tiffany's jewelry meet our strict standards.""But within the diamond industry risks associated with rising production of synthetic products are being felt.""Of course they (diamond exchanges, producers and distributors) are threatened and they should be threatened,"" said Rapaport. ""If we want to maintain the idea that the diamond is the ultimate gift ... then the diamond industry has to do something about that.""

30,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Luxury goods retailers Gucci and Tiffany failed to persuade a U.S. appeals court to require major Chinese banks to freeze the assets of alleged counterfeiters in a pair of cases that have drawn the attention of U.S. and Chinese regulators.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York directed two lower court judges on Wednesday to reexamine whether they had the authority to force compliance with court orders freezing accounts in China in light of a U.S. Supreme Court decision limiting federal court jurisdiction over foreign corporations.A lawyer for the retailers declined to comment. A lawyer for the banks did not respond to a request for comment.New York courts have grappled recently with whether foreign-based banks can be forced to comply with orders freezing overseas assets. On Tuesday, New York State's highest court heard arguments on whether state law prohibits a Motorola subsidiary from freezing the assets of a Turkish family held in the United Arab Emirates by Standard Chartered Bank [STANB.UL]. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York backed foreign banks in a similar case, warning that subjecting bank headquarters to U.S. law via their New York City branches could imperil the city's status as a global financial center. In the current litigation, Tiffany & Co and several subsidiaries of French conglomerate Kering SA, including Gucci Group, Bottega Veneta and Yves Saint Laurent, filed lawsuits in New York several years ago against numerous Chinese entities, claiming they sold counterfeit goods online.The companies asserted the counterfeiters kept their profits in accounts at state-controlled Bank of China Ltd, China Merchants Bank Co Ltd and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd.Two district judges in New York, Richard Sullivan and Naomi Reice Buchwald, separately granted the bid to freeze the funds in 2011 and 2012. The banks appealed, arguing Chinese banking law prohibited  compliance, and that U.S. courts could not exercise jurisdiction over them simply because they had branches in New York.The 2nd Circuit held the defendants were clearly subject to U.S. jurisdiction. But the court said it was not clear whether the banks themselves were also subject to the judges' authority, citing the Supreme Court's January decision in a case involving German-based automaker Daimler AG. The Supreme Court held that foreign corporations cannot be sued in the United States unless they have substantial business there. Owning a U.S. subsidiary is not enough on its own.The 2nd Circuit instructed Sullivan and Buchwald to consider, among other things, whether the banks intentionally aided the alleged counterfeiters in violating the freeze order; the nature of the banks' U.S. business and whether requiring compliance would undermine Chinese law.The 2nd Circuit cases are Gucci America et al. v.

32,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of 'A-' to Tiffany & Co. (Tiffany). Fitch has also assigned an 'A-'  rating to Tiffany's senior unsecured facilities and senior unsecured notes. The  Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Tiffany's strong positioning in the mid- to high-tier global  luxury jewelry market supporting mid-single digit top line growth, high EBITDA  margins, strong liquidity and reasonable credit metrics. Fitch expects top line  growth of 6% to 6.5%, EBITDA margin to improve modestly from 26% (adjusted for  any one-time charges) currently, and FCF to be in the range of $200 million  annually (post dividends). This should lead to adjusted debt/EBITDAR (using 8x  rent expense) trending to 2.0x over the next 12-24 months from 2.3x in both 2012  and 2013.   Well-Positioned in Premium Jewelry Segment: Tiffany is a leading designer,  manufacturer and retailer of jewelry and other luxury items with an iconic brand  image and a strong positioning within the highly fragmented global luxury  jewelry industry. In the LTM period ended July 31, 2014, the company generated  $4.2 billion of net revenue and $1.1 billion of EBITDA on a base of 293 stores.  Tiffany's top line has grown at a CAGR of 7.2% over the past five years  supported by average comparable store sales growth of about 4% and unit growth  of over 80 stores. Given its affluent customer base, demand for Tiffany's  products is expected to be more resilient than the mid-tier category in a  recessionary environment, although the category is not recession immune given  its discretionary nature. Global Demand Supports Mid-Single Digit Top Line Growth: Tiffany has a  significant international presence in markets such as Japan (14% of revenue and  23% of operating income as of Jan. 31, 2014), Asia Pacific, Europe, Canada and  Latin America that contribute more than 55% to the company's total revenues and  60% of operating income.  This diversification provides stability to the company's operations as strength  in one or more regions can potentially offset some or all of the weakness in  another region. For example, overall sales and EBITDA declined by 8% and 14%  respectively over the two year recessionary period between 2007 to 2009. This  was less than other pure U.S luxury retailers as continued growth in  international markets partly offset a 20% sales decline and 33% EBIT decline in  Tiffany's Americas  business.  Fitch expects the global luxury industry is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%  over the medium term driven both by unit demand and inflation and is supported  by the global wealth effect and tailwinds from the emerging middle class in  China and other developing markets. Tiffany is well positioned to benefit from  these secular trends, and Fitch expects top line growth of 6% to 6.5% supported  by low single-digit comps in the U.S., Japan and Europe with 6%-7% comp growth  in APAC and about 2.5% to 3% contribution from new store growth. Strong and Improving Operating Metrics: Tiffany generates a strong EBITDA margin  of over 25%, which is best in class among Fitch-rated companies in the retail  sector although at the low end of the mid-20 to mid-30 percent range at some of  the large European luxury companies. Fitch expects Tiffany's EBITDA margin to  improve modestly over the next 24-36 months on strong product mix and pricing,  with the ability for some upside on manufacturing/cost efficiencies and  leveraging of fixed expenses.  Strong Liquidity and FCF: As of July 31, 2014, Tiffany had approximately $400  million of cash and cash equivalents and $540 million available under all its  current revolving facilities. Fitch expects FCF after dividends to be  approximately $275 million to $300 million in 2014 (reflecting some tax benefit  from the Swatch arbitration charge) and $200 million annually thereafter. Fitch  expects share repurchases to be funded with excess cash.  Refinancing to Strengthen Balance Sheet: Tiffany plans to refinance and upsize  its existing $550 million unsecured multi-currency credit facilities ($275  million expires in each of Dec. 2014 and Dec. 2016) with $750 million credit  facilities (four-year and five-year, $375 million each). This will further  strengthen its liquidity profile and support the growth in its global  operations. Tiffany is also issuing $500 million of 10-year and 30-year unsecured notes to  refinance $400 million in aggregate principal amount of high coupon private  placement notes due 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The notes have the same fixed  charge coverage covenant as the credit facilities and a consolidated  indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio covenant of less than 0.6x.  Post the transaction, it will have pushed out its debt maturities past 2020 with  only $97 million of debt due Sept. 2016.  Currently, Tiffany's credit facilities and unsecured notes have upstream  guarantees from Tiffany and Company, Tiffany & Co. International, and Tiffany &  Co. Japan, Inc. The new bond issues and new revolving credit facilities will  mirror the guarantees on the issue date. After closing both the new bond issues  and the new credit facilities, Tiffany will commence measures to cause these  guarantees to be simultaneously released from each of the debt agreements. Reasonable Leverage Profile: Fitch expects Tiffany's leverage to improve  modestly to 2.0x over the next 12-24 months from 2.3x in 2012 and 2013. This  will be driven by EBITDA growth and steady debt levels beyond 2014.   RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action is unlikely given that the current rating fully  incorporates the company's financial strengths and strong positioning as a high  end retailer, as well as the inherent risks associated with being in specialty  retail and having a narrow product offering.  A negative rating action could result in the event of one or more of the  following: worse than expected top-line, profitability and cash flow trends on a  sustained basis driven by weakness in its mature markets that is not adequately  offset by its faster growing new markets, or due to a deterioration in its brand  or market positioning in the mid-to-upper tier luxury market; and/or an increase  in leverage beyond the low 2.0x range on operational weakness or a move by  management to more shareholder-friendly policies.  Fitch has assigned the following ratings to Tiffany & Co.:  --IDR 'A-'; --Senior unsecured facilities 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Energy was by far the weakest group, off 2.8 percent. The sector is now down more than 25 percent from a high reached in July. U.S. crude futures slumped 5.2 percent to $45.87 per barrel, the lowest level since 2009, while Brent crude  lost 5.6 percent as Goldman Sachs slashed its short-term price forecasts and Gulf producers showed no signs of curbing output.Wall Street opened slightly higher, suggesting a rebound from a two-week decline that had taken the S&P 500 into negative territory for the year. But the weight of the energy drag overtook any optimism about the upcoming earnings season.""There's a lot of confusion and concern about the impact of energy prices,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York. S&P 500 earnings are forecast to have risen 4 percent in the fourth quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data, sharply under the 11.1 percent growth rate forecast on Oct. 1.

Energy was by far the weakest group, off 2.7 percent. The sector is now down more than 25 percent from a high reached in July.U.S. crude futures slumped 4.1 percent to $46.39 per barrel, the lowest level since 2009, while Brent crude  lost 4.9 percent as Goldman Sachs slashed its short-term price forecasts and Gulf producers showed no signs of curbing output. Wall Street opened slightly higher, suggesting a rebound from a two-week decline that had taken the S&P 500 into negative territory for the year. But the weight of the energy drag overtook any optimism about the upcoming earnings season.""Since the beginning of the precipitous sell-off in the commodity price, we have seen very few days where you would have a 3 percent move in crude and see stock prices hold onto gains,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.""Investors have a lot of other things to think about, ... but in reality we are either going to focus on energy prices or earnings will kick in and they will shift their focus to fundamentals.""

The company is also revamping some of its older lines. These costly steps, designed to boost sales in years to come, will eat into profit in the short term, said Brian Yarbrough, analyst at Edward Jones.The company's second-quarter profit fell to $104.9 million, largely due to a 9 percent increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, which includes marketing.A strong dollar has also dented the amount spent by tourists at Tiffany's flagship Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan, besides reducing the value of the company's overseas sales. The average value of the dollar .DXY in the May-July period rose about 19 percent from a year earlier.The company's sales in the Americas fell 2 percent in the quarter ended July 31.

65,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Costco Wholesale Corp  willfully infringed Tiffany & Co's trademarks by selling counterfeit diamond engagement rings bearing the luxury retailer's name and must face a jury trial to assess damages, a U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday.U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan rejected claims by Costco that Tiffany's trademarks were invalid because they sought to prevent others from using the word ""Tiffany"" as a generic description of a type of ring setting.Instead, Swain said evidence established that Costco, the largest U.S. warehouse club chain, had infringed Tiffany's trademarks by selling engagement rings and confused consumers by using the word Tiffany in display case signs.""Despite Costco's arguments to the contrary, the court finds that, based on the record evidence, no rational finder of fact could conclude that Costco acted in good faith in adopting the Tiffany mark,"" Swain wrote.Under the ruling, Tiffany may now take Costco before a jury to seek damages, including a recovery of Costco's profits from the sale of the diamond rings and punitive damages. Swain set a hearing for Oct. 30 and directed Tiffany and Costco to ""make good faith efforts to settle the outstanding issues.""In a statement, Tiffany General Counsel Leigh Harlan welcomed the ruling, saying it ""further validates the strength and value of the Tiffany mark and reinforces our continuing efforts to protect the brand."" Representatives for Costco did not respond to requests for comment.Tiffany filed the lawsuit on Valentine's Day in February 2013, saying it believed hundreds, if not thousands, of Costco members bought engagement rings they wrongly believed were authentic Tiffany products.Tiffany said that in 2012, a person shopping at a Costco in Huntington Beach, Calif., complained to Tiffany that she was disappointed to see Costco offering for sale what were promoted on in-store signs as Tiffany diamond engagement rings.

74,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded the Long-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) for Tiffany & Co. (Tiffany) to 'BBB+' from 'A-'.  The  Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The downgrade reflects Fitch's changing expectations for Tiffany's medium term  EBITDA trends given signs of a luxury spending slowdown in the U.S. and other  key markets as well as the impact of the strong U.S. dollar on tourist spend in  the U.S. (Fitch projects foreign tourism accounts for approximately 25% of  Tiffany's U.S. sales).  Fitch's prior rating was predicated on EBITDA improvement beginning 2016 after  an approximate 10% reduction in 2015, yielding an improving adjusted leverage  trend toward the low-2.0x range over the next 24 - 36 months from the mid-2.0x  range in 2015.  However, Fitch now sees negative comparable store sales (comps)  driving a 1 - 3% decline in 2016 EBITDA and flattish leverage around 2.6x. Even  with mid-single digit annual EBITDA growth beginning 2017, adjusted leverage is  now expected to remain in the mid-2.0x range over the forecast horizon. The rating continues to reflect Tiffany's strong position in the global premium  jewelry segment, its iconic brand image, and generally strong cash flow and  credit metrics. Comps Deceleration: Tiffany's Americas comps were negative 8% during the Q4  holiday period (the Americas represents approximately 50% of Tiffany's sales).   Fitch believes sales, especially in Tiffany's lower price point categories  including silver jewelry, were negatively impacted by reduced international  tourism related to the strong U.S. dollar as well as a general stagnation in  U.S. luxury spending. Fitch now expects domestic comps in the negative  low-single digits for 2016 against prior expectations for a modestly positive  comp. Comps in the Asia-Pacific region (approximately 25% of sales) also  decelerated during the holiday period to negative 9% on weakness in Hong Kong  and Singapore, with recent economic pressure in China limiting Fitch's optimism  for a rebound in 2016. Fitch notes ongoing strength in Tiffany's Japan business  (approximately 13% of sales) is somewhat due to foreign travellers visiting  Japan instead of the United States. Continued EBITDA Decline: Fitch projects a 10% decline in 2015 EBITDA, to the $1  billion level. Fitch expects 2016 EBITDA to decline 1 - 3% to the $975 million  range, predicated on negative low-single digit comps and continued transaction  and translation pressure from the strong U.S. dollar. Gross margin is projected  to modestly increase on favorable sourcing costs and continued, modest price  increases.  SG&A spend is expected to be flattish as the company seeks expense  efficiency in a negative sales environment.   Fitch expects annual EBITDA growth to begin to turn positive in 2017 in the 4 -  5% range, assuming comps turn positive and the U.S. dollar does not continue to  strengthen. Annual free cash flow after dividends (FCF) is expected to be in the  $150 - $200 million range beginning 2016, with 2015 FCF expected in the $300  million range on reduced inventory buys. Leverage To Remain in Mid-2x Range: As a result of continued EBITDA declines,  Fitch now sees adjusted leverage remaining in the mid-2.0x range over the next  24 - 36 months,. Fitch expects Tiffany will use FCF and cash on hand to fund its  recently announced $500 million share buyback, and does not project any debt  pay-down in the forecast horizon. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --2015 total revenue growth expected to be down 3 - 4% due to currency  headwinds, with constant currency same store sales flattish. Revenue growth in  2016 is expected to be down 1 - 3% on modestly negative comps, with annual  growth beginning 2017 projected at 3 - 4%, predicated on 2% square footage  growth and low single digit constant currency comps. --Gross margin expected to rise 20bps annually on retail price increases and  some fixed cost leverage. In 2016, gross margin should continue to benefit from  the positive impact of mix shift to lower-priced items, which have higher  margins. --SG&A expense anticipated to grow 3% this year and be flattish in 2016, leading  to deleverage given comp trends, and grow 3 - 4% thereafter, in line with sales  growth. --EBITDA is expected to be down approximately 10% in 2015 to $1 billion and down  1 - 3% in 2016 to the $975 million range on negative comps, fixed-cost  deleverage and the negative impact of the strong U.S. dollar.  Beginning 2017,  annual EBITDA is expected to grow 4 - 5%. --Dividends are planned to increase approximately 10% per year. --FCF expectation of $300 million in 2015 and $150 to $200 million thereafter,  which will be primarily deployed towards share repurchases.  --Leverage expected to be 2.5x in 2015, increasing to 2.6x in 2016 and remaining  in the mid-2.0x range over the forecast horizon. RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action could occur if a comps reacceleration yields EBITDA  growth such that leverage improves to 2.0x. A negative rating action could result in the event of one or more of the  following: (i) worse than expected organic top-line, profitability and cash flow  trends driven by prolonged weakness in its mature markets that is not adequately  offset by its faster growing new markets, (ii) deterioration in its brand or  market positioning in the mid-to-upper tier luxury market, and (iii) leverage  sustaining in the high 2.0x range on operational weakness or a move by  management to more shareholder-friendly policies.  LIQUIDITY  As of Oct. 31, 2015, Tiffany had $673 million of cash and cash equivalents and  $818 million available under all its current revolving facilities. In October  2014, Tiffany refinanced and upsized its $550 million unsecured multi-currency  credit facilities ($275 million due Dec. 2014 and Dec. 2016) with $750 million  credit facilities (4-year and 5-year $375 million each). Fitch expects annual  FCF after dividends to be approximately $300 million in 2015 and $80 million to  $100 million thereafter. Fitch expects share repurchases to be funded with  excess cash.  In 2014, Tiffany also issued $250 million and $300 million of 10-year and  30-year unsecured notes, respectively, to refinance $400 million in aggregate  principal amount of private placement notes due 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2019. Post  the transaction, the company's next debt maturity will be in 2024, with only $83  million of debt due Sept. 2016.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded Tiffany's ratings as follows: --Long-term IDR to 'BBB+' from 'A-'; --Senior unsecured facilities to 'BBB+' from 'A-'; --Senior unsecured notes to 'BBB+' from 'A-'.

76,"   By Ramkumar Iyer  Upscale jeweler Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) reported a better-than-expected profit for the holiday quarter as it raised prices and benefited from lower prices of diamonds, gold and silver.Shares of the company, which became a household name due to the 1961 Hollywood classic ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", rose as much as 4 percent in morning trading on Friday. Weakness in the global economy and a strong dollar have hurt Tiffany and other luxury retailers such as Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N), Neiman Marcus Group and Macy's Inc-owned (M.N) Bloomingdale's as tourists shy away from buying high-end items.  Tiffany's reluctance to offer promotions also prevented it from attracting local shoppers looking for deals, especially in the holiday season. The company warned that it expected profit per share to fall by 15-20 percent in the current quarter and by 5-10 percent in the second quarter, based on the trends seen so far. However, earnings are expected to start growing from the second half of the year ending January 2017, Tiffany said.  The company will launch more new products and it has been pretty successful with recent product launches, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. ""Also, expectations were low and the stock's been beat up,"" he said, suggesting that Friday's rise in Tiffany's shares was a relief rally after a fall of 18 percent in the past 12 months. The jeweler's gross margin rose to 63 percent in the fourth quarter from 60.8 percent a year earlier as raw material, labor and marketing costs declined.  However, sales fell 5.6 percent to $1.21 billion, the fifth straight quarter of decline. Sales at stores open for at least a year fell 10 percent in the Americas, a bigger drop than the 9.4 percent analysts had expected, according to Consensus Metrix. Tiffany sales have also slowed in Greater China as fewer Chinese tourists visit Hong Kong, one of its most important markets in the region, Mark Aaron, vice president of investor relations, said on a conference call. In Europe, sales to tourists are expected to fall due to sociopolitical uncertainties, Chief Executive Frederic Cumenal said. Tiffany's net income declined 17 percent to $163.2 million, or $1.28 per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31.Excluding items, the company earned $1.46 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.40, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Tiffany's shares were up 2.7 percent at $72.02 in late morning trading.

""Also, expectations were low and the stock's been beat up,"" he said, suggesting that Friday's rise in Tiffany's shares was a relief rally after a fall of 18 percent in the past 12 months. The jeweler's gross margin rose to 63 percent in the fourth quarter from 60.8 percent a year earlier as raw material, labor and marketing costs declined.  However, sales fell 5.6 percent to $1.21 billion, the fifth straight quarter of decline. Sales at stores open for at least a year fell 10 percent in the Americas, a bigger drop than the 9.4 percent analysts had expected, according to Consensus Metrix. Tiffany sales have also slowed in Greater China as fewer Chinese tourists visit Hong Kong, one of its most important markets in the region, Mark Aaron, vice president of investor relations, said on a conference call. In Europe, sales to tourists are expected to fall due to sociopolitical uncertainties, Chief Executive Frederic Cumenal said. Tiffany's net income declined 17 percent to $163.2 million, or $1.28 per share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31.Excluding items, the company earned $1.46 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.40, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Tiffany's shares were up 2.7 percent at $72.02 in late morning trading.

Tiffany does not break out UK sales. The company, which makes the iconic ""Tiffany Setting"" diamond engagement ring, has been struggling to get back in the good books of wealthy American consumers, and woo hard-to-please millennials who are taking their business to cheaper and hipper shops.""The global environment continues to reflect well known challenges that we believe have had broad effects on spending by local customers, as well as foreign tourists, especially from China,"" Chief Executive Frederic Cumenal said in a statement.Lower tourist spending has also dented sales at luxury retailers such as Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS.N) and Kate Spade & Co (KATE.N).Signet Jewelers Ltd (SIG.N), which sells jewelry at lower prices than Tiffany, on Thursday reported an unexpected drop in comparable sales for the quarter due to weaker demand for its Sterling and Zale lines. COMMODITY BENEFITS    Tiffany benefited from lower gold, silver and platinum prices, and also the sale of more high-margin jewelry, in the May-July quarter. While precious metal prices have risen sharply this year, they fell to multi-year lows last year, and it takes jewelry companies 9-12 months to make and get products to its shelves, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. Tiffany's net income inched up to $105.7 million, or 84 cents per share, in the quarter ended July 31 from $104.9 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average were expecting profit 72 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

The company, which makes the iconic ""Tiffany Setting"" diamond engagement ring, has been struggling to get back in the good books of wealthy American consumers, and woo hard-to-please millennials who are taking their business to cheaper and hipper shops.""The global environment continues to reflect well known challenges that we believe have had broad effects on spending by local customers, as well as foreign tourists, especially from China,"" Chief Executive Frederic Cumenal said in a statement.Lower tourist spending has also dented sales at luxury retailers such as Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS.N) and Kate Spade & Co (KATE.N).Signet Jewelers Ltd (SIG.N), which sells jewelry at lower prices than Tiffany, on Thursday reported an unexpected drop in comparable sales for the quarter due to weaker demand for its Sterling and Zale lines. COMMODITY BENEFITS    Tiffany benefited from lower gold, silver and platinum prices, and also the sale of more high-margin jewelry, in the May-July quarter. While precious metal prices have risen sharply this year, they fell to multi-year lows last year, and it takes jewelry companies 9-12 months to make and get products to its shelves, Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. Tiffany's net income inched up to $105.7 million, or 84 cents per share, in the quarter ended July 31 from $104.9 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average were expecting profit 72 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.  Tiffany maintained its full-year profit forecast of a net sales falling in the low single-digits in percentage terms, and earnings per share declining in the mid-single-digit percentage range. Total net sales in the second quarter fell to $931.6 million, lower than analysts' expectation of $934.74 million.

Lawyers for both sides were presenting evidence on Friday to help determine the amount of punitive damages.The trial, which began on Sept. 20, was aimed at determining the amount in total damages that Costco is liable for, after U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain ruled last year that Costco had willfully infringed Tiffany's trademark by selling rings bearing the luxury retailer's name. Tiffany spokesman Nathan Strauss declined to comment on  Friday. In a statement on its website, Costco said it would not comment because jury deliberations were continuing.The $5.5 million represents the amount of profit Costco made from the sale of the rings that would fairly compensate Tiffany, said the jury, which was made up of five men and two women. The amount far exceeds the $781,000 that Costco had argued at the start of the trial was the maximum it owed. Costco said about 2,500 rings it sold were found by the court to have infringed Tiffany's trademark.Costco had also argued that Tiffany's trademarks were invalid because they sought ti prevent others from using the word ""Tiffany"" as a generic description of a type of ring setting. But Swain rejected that argument and said Costco confused consumers by using the word Tiffany in display case signs.She said Costco's jewelry buyers had asked vendors to copy Tiffany designs, and that evidence showed Costco employees were aware of customer confusion but did nothing to remedy it.The case is Tiffany & Company and Tiffany (NJ) LLC v.
