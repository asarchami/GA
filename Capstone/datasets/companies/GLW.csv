0,"   By Neha Alawadhi  Specialty glass maker Corning Inc (GLW.N) warned that prices of LCD glass would decline further in the current quarter, raising concerns about growth in its display business.Corning shares fell as much as 9 percent on Tuesday.""The one major concern investors walked away from the outlook was the pricing pressure in first quarter. Instead of being down 2-3 percent in the quarter versus the prior quarter, it's probably going to be down twice that amount,"" said analyst Steven Fox of Cross Research.Core sales in Corning's display technologies business, which makes LCD panels for Sony Corp (6758.T) and Lenovo Group (0992.HK), fell 5 percent to $665 million in the fourth quarter.The display business accounts for more than a third of the company's revenue.Corning, best known for its Gorilla glass used in smartphones, said prices of LCD glass are expected to decline further this quarter as some contracts signed in 2012 require the company to match prices offered by rivals. ""We anticipate our price declines will return to more moderate levels after first quarter ...,"" Chief Financial Officer Jim Flaws said in an earnings call after the company reported better-than-expected quarter ended December 31.""If prices were to continue to decline like they are in first quarter, our competition would soon be incurring losses,"" he said.Corning said it would still be profitable at even lowered prices as its costs are already lower than its competitors by a substantial percentage.""The concern today may be related to pricing for display glass which took an unexpected dip at the end of the quarter,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Sue told Reuters in an e-mail. Corning bought out Samsung Display from a 1995 LCD glass joint venture in October, a deal that was expected to add about $2 billion to Corning's annual sales.The company, whose Gorilla glass is used in smartphones made by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), said net income rose to $421 million, or 30 cents per share, in the fourth quarter from $155 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier.Net sales fell 9 percent to $1.96 billion. Corning's core earnings were 29 cents per share.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 27 cents per share on revenue of $1.93 billion, according to Thomson ReutersI/B/E/S.

2,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By John WasikCHICAGO, April 21 If you're ecology minded, the news hasn't been all that green of late, with ice caps and glaciers melting and storms becoming more destructive. But there is a huge silver lining for long-term investors in environmentally-friendly companies and technologies.To stave off a nearly 5-degree global temperature increase by 2100, nations must cut their global greenhouse emissions by up to 70 percent by the middle of this century, according to a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.There's little consensus among developed and emerging nations on how to effectively deal with climate change and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases, but there is agreement on one aspect of this global threat: Trillions of needed dollars will continue to pour into renewable and clean sources of energy, transportation, building and manufacturing.Although investors have typically focused on a small group of ""clean tech"" funds and stocks, you can cast a wider net to capture the upside of this influx of investment. Nearly every company in the S&P 500 Index has some involvement in ""greening"" their operations from recycling to creating their own sources of clean energy.Take wind power. The retailer Ikea recently announced it was buying a wind farm in Illinois. Microsoft Corp is purchasing a Texas wind facility. Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc are also investing in the technology. On the solar power front, solar panel prices have plummeted and there are a host of collateral technologies such as battery storage, energy management systems and co-generation that deserve attention.One of the oldest and most diversified mutual funds in this sector is the New Alternatives Fund Inc, which is up 35 percent for the last 12 months through April 17 and up 8 percent year to date, compared to just under one percent for the MSCI EAFE index. The fund is expensive to own, though, charging a 1.1 percent annual management fee and 4.75-percent initial sales charge.The New Alternatives portfolio samples several companies from the clean tech sector, holding industry leaders like Vestas Wind Systems A/S, Johnson Controls Inc and American Water Works Co. A less-costly fund to own is the PowerShares Cleantech ETF , which holds ABB Ltd, Corning Inc and Siemens AG, companies with several stakes in broad-based energy businesses. The fund charges 0.67 percent annually for management expenses. It's up 33 percent for the 12 months through April 17.LANDSCAPE FOR GREEN POWER  What will make alternative energy profitable is what experts called clean ""distributed"" power, that is, electricity that's not generated by old-line utilities on the grid using coal or nuclear energy. When clean energy becomes competitive with fossil fuels, that's when it makes economic sense, which has been increasingly the case.Falling costs of alternative energy products in recent year are enhancing the potential of clean energy technologies and displacing ""dirty"" power plants.According to a recent report by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company on solar energy, the drop in price residential consumers pay in the United States to install rooftop solar systems means ""These cost reductions will put solar within striking distance, in economic terms, of new construction for traditional power-generation technologies, such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear energy.""The outlook for solar energy also applies in a general sense to wind and other clean-energy technologies. As costs of running a coal-fired or nuclear plant continue to rise, alternative energy prices keep falling, making them competitive on a mass scale.As one of the smallest sub-sectors in the overall economy, though, clean energy has been volatile. And price wars in solar cells have turned leading solar companies valuations into roller coasters. First Solar Inc's stock price, for example, was in negative territory from 2009 through 2012, then skyrocketed 77 percent last year. The company is up 27 percent year-to-date through April 17.Take heed: Even investing through a diversified index fund like the PowerShares ETF is going to be rocky. The fund has a five-year volatility measure of nearly 22, compared to about 16 for an MSCI World stock index.  It also lost half of its value in 2008. If you're going to invest in this sector, stay away from concentrating your holdings in single stocks. While the climate for these stocks looks good at the moment - and will certainly pay dividends over time - the short-term outlook could change rapidly.

4,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Specialty glass maker Corning Inc (GLW.N), best known for its Gorilla glass used in smartphones and tablets, said it expected LCD glass price declines to be ""significantly less"" in the current quarter compared with the first quarter.Shares in Corning, which also reported slightly better-than-expected first-quarter results, were up almost 4 percent in trading before the bell on Monday.The company said it expects core profit in the display business to grow in the second quarter, after dropping 4 percent in the first quarter due to a decline in LCD glass prices from the previous quarter.""We think (due to) the combination of the glass market growing, the price declines moderating and the positive impact of CPM (Corning Precision Materials), we should get growth in our display business in the second quarter,"" Corning's Senior Vice President Tony Tripeny told Reuters. Core sales from the display technologies business, which makes LCD panels for Sony Corp (6758.T), LG and Lenovo Group (0992.HK) and brings in more than a third of the company's revenue, grew 58 percent.Corning had warned in January that prices of LCD glass would decline further in the first quarter as some contracts signed in 2012 required the company to match prices offered by rivals.""... As LCD price declines lessen, we expect improved results throughout the year,"" Chief Financial Officer James Flaws said in a statement. Tripeny added that the company expects a ""really strong"" quarter for Gorilla Glass, which is used in smartphones made by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS).Corning reported net income of $301 million, or 20 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $494 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. The company's core earnings were 31 cents per share.Corning said revenue rose to $2.29 billion from $1.81 billion.Analysts on average had expected core earnings of 30 cents per share on revenue of $2.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.(Editing by Joyjeet Das)",2014-04-28,GLW,"Mon Apr 28, 2014 | 8:51am EDT",Corning expects smaller price declines,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-corning-results-idUSBREA3R0R520140428?type=companyNews

8,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON May 6 If you're looking for top performing U.S. junk bond funds, pick one that's maxed out in stocks.Bond-fund managers at Loomis Sayles, Fidelity and Eaton Vance are trouncing their benchmarks and almost all their peers by taking advantage of asset allocation rules that permit as much as 35 percent of their holdings in stocks.""Prices are sky high in all sectors of the fixed income market,"" said Matthew Eagan, a portfolio manager at the $18 billion Loomis Sayles Strategic Income Fund. That's why Eagan and some of his competitors are boosting returns by buying stocks and building on existing positions that deliver a one-two punch of dividend yield and capital appreciation.Eagan's bond fund has a 1-year return of 7.92 percent, easily beating the 0.21 advance of its benchmark index and better than 98 percent of its peers in the multisector bond category, according to Morningstar Inc. Its No. 2 overall holding, shares of Corning Inc, have surged 18 percent this year and 41 percent in the past 12 months.Doing even better is the Eaton Vance Bond Fund, whose 1-year return is 9.81 percentage points higher than its benchmark. It is the best performing multisector bond fund with a 1-year return of 10.02 percent, according to Lipper Inc, a Thomson Reuters company.  The $664 million fund's portfolio is about 16 percent to 18 percent invested in stocks, portfolio manager Kathleen Gaffney said.During last month's sell-off of momentum stocks such as biotechnology companies, the Eaton Vance fund took advantage of the stock market dip by adding to existing stock positions, Gaffney said. The fund's largest stock holdings include Ingersoll-Rand PLC, Regions Financial Corp <RF. N>, SLM Corp and Kinder Morgan Inc.Fidelity Investments junk bond fund manager Mark Notkin said the earnings yield of stocks in the S&P 500 Index is now about 6.25 percent. That's better than the 5.2 percent yield of junk bonds, which typically have the highest yields in the bond market.Earnings yield is the inverse of a stock's price-to-earnings ratio and shows the percentage of each dollar invested in the stock that was earned by the company. It's calculated by dividing the earnings per share for the most recent 12-month period with the current market price per share. The earnings yield on S&P 500 stocks has been beating junk bond yields ever since the beginning of the economic recovery, with some of the most pronounced gains coming this month, according to Reuters data. ""Historically, if you look back 25 years, high-yield would be several hundred basis points more than the earnings yield of the S&P 500,"" Notkin said. ""Now, the S&P is a 100 basis points more than the high-yield market. That isn't a little off-kilter, but substantially off-kilter.""Notkin said that's a reason to buy stocks, which he said could outperform junk bond yields for the next two to three years.The Lipper Core Bond Funds index is up 0.11 percent for the 1-year period, as of May 2. And that same index is up 3.2 percent year to date, as of May 2.To be sure, bond fund managers still have to be able to pick the right stocks. The Pioneer High Yield Fund, whose portfolio managers declined to comment, hit some turbulence in the first quarter with its stock selection. The portfolio's allocation to equities was the largest detractor from relative returns. The fund's Class A shares returned 2.6 percent in the quarter, compared to the 3 percent return on the Bank of America Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II Index.One of the fund's stock picks, General Cable Corp, is down 19 percent this year after the company said its income from Venezuela would fall because of changes in the currency exchange rate, pricing controls and social unrest in that country.MANDATE FLEXIBILITY Some multisector and junk bond funds have the flexibility in their mandates to buy stocks and preferred stocks in addition to their holdings of bonds of all stripes. Eagan's fund at Loomis Sayles, for example, can hold as much as 35 percent of its assets in preferred stocks and dividend-paying common stocks.The $10.3 billion Fidelity Capital & Income Fund  run by Notkin, has been maxed out for several quarters with almost 20 percent of its portfolio in stocks, according to its latest fund disclosure. Notkin's bet on Station Casinos was a top contributor to the Fidelity fund's first-quarter performance after the casino operator got a lift from better-than-expected results from its Las Vegas operations.United Rentals Inc, a top stock holding in Notkin's fund, has climbed 18 percent in the past three months as a recovery in the commercial construction industry boosts demand and rental rates for the company's equipment.Notkin's fund has been on a winning streak for a long time, posting a 5-year average annual return of 16.93 percent, compared to the benchmark average annual return of 4.89 percent, according to Morningstar.That puts Notkin's fund in the top 97 percent in high-yield bond category. The fund's 1-year return of 7.59 percent has been helped by avoiding pricey high-yield debt that's trading above par.Bond fund managers who venture into the stock market tend to be value investors, hunting for large-cap, dividend-rich stocks that come with solid balance sheets and strong cash flow.""I stay away from the high flyers,"" Eaton Vance's Gaffney said. She added that stocks shelter part of her portfolio from the interest-rate risk that can hurt a bond fund's performance.If a stock has a dividend yield of around 4 percent, it's fine with some bond fund managers if its share price does little in the way of appreciation.""Four percent is shaping up to be a good number for all bond managers in 2014,"" said Eagan at Loomis Sayles.(Reporting By Tim McLaughlin)",2014-05-06,GLW,"Tue May 6, 2014 | 11:53am EDT",Junk bond fund yields trounce peers as managers buy stocks to boost returns,http://www.reuters.com//article/funds-bonds-stocks-idUSL2N0NR18W20140506?type=companyNews
9,"   By Abhirup Roy and Subrat Patnaik  Corning Inc (GLW.N) reported second-quarter core earnings below analysts' average estimate, hurt by lower demand for its Gorilla Glass, which is used in iPhones and the Galaxy devices.Corning shares fell as much as 10 percent on Tuesday.Gorilla glass sales fell due to lower demand for smartphones and tablets and a delay in the launch of certain new products, Corning's senior vice president, Tony Tripeny, told Reuters.The company cut its full-year growth forecast for cover glass shipments to 20 percent, Chief Financial Officer James Flaws said on a conference call.Flaws estimated that growth in the media tablet market had slowed significantly, compared with the company's expectations at the beginning the year.    The company's overall share of tablet sales is likely to fall from a year earlier, especially since most of the growth is in the unbranded tablet segment, which Corning is less exposed to, Flaws said.Corning did not give its prior forecast for overall cover glass shipments, but had said in January that it expected shipments of Gorilla glass alone to rise at least 30 percent in 2014. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS), one of Corning's biggest customers, reported weak handset sales in the second quarter, as it faced slowing market growth and intensifying price competition. Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is also reportedly planning to switch from using Gorilla glass to GT Advanced Technologies' GTAT.O Sapphire glass for its next iPhone.Shares of GT Advanced Technologies have more than tripled in the past year, while Corning's shares have gained 43 percent. Corning has also been hurt by falling LCD glass prices over the past few quarters, but said it expected prices to fall at a slower pace in the current quarter.The company reported a rise in quarterly core net sales, helped by higher demand for TVs in the run-up to the FIFA World Cup.Core sales from Corning's display technologies business, which makes LCD panels for Sony Corp (6758.T), LG and Lenovo Group (0992.HK), and accounts for more than 25 percent of the company's revenue, grew 62 percent. The company posted core earnings of 37 cents per share on core net sales of $2.58 billion, missing the analysts' average estimate of a profit of 38 cents per share on revenue of $2.53 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company's net income slumped 74 percent to $169 million, or 11 cents per share, in the second quarter.

The strategy triggered bets on long-term advantages for peers but the initial gains reversed in late morning trade. The S&P telecoms sector index rose 2.8 percent after earlier gaining as much as 5.5 percent.""Winstream was unbelievably good at keeping this close to the vest and everybody was surprised,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.

The S&P industrial sector fell 0.6 percent. Corning shares dropped 9.8 percent to $19.90 after second-quarter core earnings came in below analysts' estimates.Dow components Merck and Pfizer reported better-than-expected results.

GT was worth more than $2.8 billion in early July on hopes of its scratch-resistant sapphire glass being a part of the new iPhones.""It's unbelievable ... I don't think anyone expected this,"" said Dennis Dick, a proprietary trader at Bright Trading LLC in Las Vegas.""I can't remember the last time ... well Bear Stearns was probably the last time, but we were in a financial crisis then. This was completely out of the blue.""The stock had more than doubled in the nine months between November's announcement of the new Arizona plant and the launch of Apple's new large-screen iPhones on Sept. 9 as investors hoped GT would replicate Corning Inc's success with Gorilla Glass. Since then the stock had slumped 36 percent after GT's sapphire glass was left out of the new iPhones. GT had said a month earlier that the Arizona plant would not be fully operational until early 2015.""It would appear that something very fundamentally broke down in the relationship between Apple and GT Advanced,"" Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said in an email.GT said on Aug. 5 it was expecting Apple to pay it $139 million in connection with the plant. Apple had paid it $439 million totally as of that date.The company had warned then that costs related to the plant had a ""significant impact"" on its liquidity and results. Still, it forecast revenue of $600-$700 million for the full year, more than double the $299 million it reported in 2013. According to data from Markit, which tracks short interest, 43 percent of GT's shares outstanding were being loaned out for short bets, a very high level that indicates there were plenty of investors who thought this stock was headed lower.EXCLUSIVE DEAL Apple will use a sapphire screen for two of the three versions of its Apple Watch, which will be available early next year. It also uses the material on the camera cover and touch sensor button on its iPhones.The deal with Apple placed restrictions on GT selling the sapphire screens for use in certain applications, according to the company's regulatory filings. GT gave Apple an exclusive license for certain applications of its sapphire glass technology, but the iPad maker had no obligation to buy the glass, according to the filings.GT, whose subsidiaries also filed for bankruptcy, said it had $85 million of cash as of Sept. 29. The company had cash and cash equivalents of $333.1 million as of June 28.The company has reported a loss for the last four quarters, but raised the lower end of its full-year adjusted profit forecast in August, citing higher margins.GT, which also makes equipment for consumer electronics, power electronics, solar and LED products, said in its Chapter 11 petition that it had assets of $1.5 billion and liabilities  of $1.3 billion as of June 28.The company filed for bankruptcy in a U.S. bankruptcy court in the District of New Hampshire and said it was seeking debtor-in-possession financing to get access to additional funds.GT said it expected the court to authorize it to continue to conduct business as usual while it reorganized.By 1:30 p.m. ET, more than 115 million shares had changed hands, making it the most actively traded stock on the Nasdaq, despite being halted five times due to excessive volatility.The case is in re: GT Advanced Technologies Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of New Hampshire, No: 14-11916.

28,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has rated Corning Inc.'s (Corning) $750  million of senior notes 'A-'. Corning will use net proceeds from the three- and  seven-year senior notes sale for general corporate purposes. The Rating Outlook  is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's expectation for solid near-term  operating performance, driven by positive momentum across all segments,  particularly Optical Communications, Gorilla Glass, and Environmental. Growing  profitability in non-Display businesses and modestly lower capital expenditures  will translate into higher annual free cash flow (FCF). Over the longer term, continued fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) build-outs, increased  demand for data, storage and processing, and wireless applications support  growth in Optical Communications, although demand will remain less predictable  due to uneven customer capital spending. In Environmental, regulations are  expected to continue supporting top-line growth. Fitch expects solid longer-term growth for Corning's non-Display businesses will  better balance the company's operating profile. At the same time, profitability  at the Display business should improve moderately in the intermediate term with  higher gross margins, driven by higher volumes and the shift of production to  more efficient Corning Precision Materials (CPM) capacity.  Profitability for non-Display businesses will continue to lag Display but Fitch  expects gross margins for non-Display businesses will benefit from increased  scale. Blended operating EBITDA margin could exceed 30% in the intermediate  term, versus a Fitch-estimated mid-20% for the latest 12-month (LTM) ended March  31, 2015 and mid-60% for Display. Capital intensity will remain substantial for Corning. However, the addition of  Corning Precision manufacturing assets and available capacity from historical  additions in Specialty Materials and Environmental should result in lower  intermediate-term capital spending. As a result, Fitch expects annual FCF will  approach and approximate $1 billion over this time frame.  Fitch expects credit protection measures to remain solid for the rating, with  total leverage (total debt-to-operating EBITDA) below 2x. Interest coverage  (operating EBITDA-to-interest expense) will exceed 15x through the intermediate  term. Pro forma for the debt issuance, Fitch estimates total leverage of 1.9x  (including preferred shares at 50% equity credit). KEY RATINGS DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook are supported by Fitch's expectations for:  --Solid profitability and annual FCF;  --Leading technology in several key end markets translating into significant LCD  glass share leadership and strong market positions in fiber for telecom, and  ceramic filters for automotive applications;  --Solid liquidity position and conservative financial policies, underpinned by a  net cash position and disciplined share repurchases. Concerns center on Corning's:  --Significant ongoing investments in R&D and capital spending requirements; --Corning's need to offset meaningful annual average selling price (ASP)  reductions in Display and Specialty Materials with manufacturing efficiencies; --Slower than anticipated segment diversification, driven by lower revenue  growth and profitability expansion for non-Display segments.  RATINGS SENSITIVITIES Fitch believes positive rating actions are unlikely in the absence of  structurally higher recurring FCF, likely from lower capital intensity and  meaningful profitability expansion in non-Display businesses, in conjunction  with a commitment to more conservative financial policies. Negative rating actions could occur if:  --Corning is unable to offset ASP erosion with productivity gains in LCD which  results in structurally lower profitability (operating margins below 30% and  total debt-to-operating EBITDA sustained above 2x); --Corning is unable to drive gross margin expansion in its non-Display  businesses, resulting in annual FCF below $500 million. As of March 31, 2015, Corning's liquidity was solid and supported by:  --$5.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments,  approximately 40% of which was located in the U.S.;  --An undrawn $2 billion unsecured RCF expiring Sept. 30, 2019. The facility  includes a maximum 50% debt-to-total capital covenant (13% at March 31, 2015). Fitch's expectations for annual FCF of more than $1 billion through the forecast  period also support Corning's liquidity. Fitch expects Corning will use FCF for  share repurchases and acquisitions, particularly in Optical Communications and  fragmented Life Sciences markets.  Pro forma for the senior notes issuance, total debt as of March 31, 2015 was  $5.2 billion (including the unrated $1.15 billion of convertible preferred stock  after applying 50% equity credit to $2.3 billion of preferred shares issued to  Samsung).  Fitch currently rates Corning as follows: Corning, Inc.  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt rating 'A-';  --Senior unsecured RCF 'A-'.  --Short-term IDR and commercial paper 'F2'.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Low-single-digit growth in 2015, driven by solid demand for FTTH build-outs in  Optical Communications, regulation-driven increased diesel purchases, and  Gorilla Glass growth; --Fitch anticipates Display growth will be flat to slightly up, driven by higher  volumes and lower ASP erosion; --Weaker demand at Hemlock will drive lower dividends from the Dow-Corning joint  venture; --Profitability will expand from operating efficiencies, given the incorporation  of SCP manufacturing assets and increasing scale in non-Display businesses; --Capital spending will remain in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range through  the intermediate term, driving more than $1 billion of annual FCF;  --Share repurchases and dividends will at least approximate and could exceed  annual pre-dividend FCF over the intermediate term.

29,"  NEW YORK, June 7 Shares of glassmaker Corning Inc could jump 40 percent in the next 18 months as demand for 4K ultra high-definition televisions climb, according to a report by Barron's on Sunday.The company that invented Pyrex is carving out a niche making products linked to the digital age, including glass for smartphones, optical fiber for networks and ultra thin glass to facilitate Internet video streaming, Barron's said. Corning's products, including glass for the 4K TVs, could ""usher in a new era of technology"" to meet demand from the growing online streaming industry, the report said. Beyond TVs, the company is developing something called Willow glass, Barron's said, a product that could be very thin and pliable. That could be used for smartphones and other devices like solar panels. Corning is also working on developing antimicrobial glass for elevator buttons, hospital walls, cruise-ship railing and shared tablets.  Shares of Corning are down 10 percent this year and closed at $20.71 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.

30,"  * Glass tubing business to be sold to Corning for 196 mln eur* Trims 2018 EBITDA margin forecast to 20 pct from 21 pct* Shares drop 6 pct   (Adds details on new forecasts, shares)FRANKFURT, June 30 German drugs packaging firm Gerresheimer has agreed to sell its glass tubing business to Corning and trimmed its 2018 profitability forecast, hitting its shares on Tuesday. Gerresheimer said it expected proceeds of about 196 million euros ($219 million) from the sale of the basic tubes business, which it said did not fit its focus on finished products for the pharmaceuticals industry.The deal will not affect Gerresheimer's 2015 guidance, the company said, but it now sees adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) at about 20 percent of sales by 2018, down from its previous guidance for a 21 percent margin. Shares in Gerresheimer dropped 6 percent to 50.74 euros by 0817 GMT and were the biggest faller in a 1 percent weaker European healthcare index.""The reduced EBITDA margin guidance cannot be fully explained by the divestment of the tubing business, in our view,"" Equinet analyst Konrad Lieder wrote in a note, downgrading Gerresheimer to ""reduce"" from ""hold"". Lieder added that Equinet views the reduction as reflecting Gerresheimer's limited margin potential because of low pricing power and intellectual property protection.Gerresheimer said that as part of the deal U.S. glassmaker Corning would supply it for 10 years with the basic glass tubes from which it makes ampoules, vials, cartridges and syringes.The two companies also agreed to form a joint venture to develop new glass packaging products for the pharma industry.

Falling crop prices and rising fertilizer output have triggered consolidation among farm-focused companies.""Everyone is talking to everyone,"" Dow Chief Executive Andrew Liveris said on a conference call.Dow's best option may be to merge its agri unit with Monsanto Co or Dupont or sell it altogether, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst James Sheehan said.Monsanto is looking to grow through acquisitions after its failed bid for Syngenta AG. Speculation of a tieup between Dow's agri unit and Dupont intensified this month after Dupont Chief Executive Ellen Kullman stepped down.

47,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings believes that the ratings for Corning  Incorporated (Corning), including the 'BBB+' long-term Issuer Default Rating  (IDR), are unaffected by Corning's exchange of its shares in Dow Corning  Corporation (Dow Corning), a joint venture with Dow Chemical Company (Dow). A  full list of current ratings for Corning follows at the end of this release. Corning announced this morning the exchange of its shares in Dow Corning for the  shares of a wholly owned Dow Corning entity, which holds shares in Hemlock  Semiconductor (Hemlock), and $4.8 billion in cash, bolstering liquidity. In  connection with the tax-free exchange, Corning retained a 40.25% interest in  Hemlock, maker of polysilicon for semiconductors and solar panels, which more  closely aligns with Corning's core technology and manufacturing platforms.  Fitch believes Corning is likely to use cash in the new entity to help fund the  company's capital allocation plan (the Plan) updated on Oct. 27, 2015. The Plan  includes investing approximately $10 billion to maintain technology and market  leadership through 2019 and returning more than $10 billion to shareholders,  including a $1.25 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program that  commenced in the current quarter. In connection with the Plan, Corning raised  its target total leverage (total debt-to-operating EBITDA) to 2x from 1.5x and  lowered target cash balances to $2 billion from $5 billion, resulting in Fitch's  downgrade of Corning's ratings to 'BBB+' from 'A-' on Oct. 29, 2015. Fitch expects operating performance for Hemlock will remain volatile, given  cyclical semiconductor and solar panel demand patterns and excess capacity  throughout the supply chain, despite restructuring actions aimed at reducing  manufacturing costs. In addition, Hemlock's settlements of long-term contracts  related to lower than expected  contractual customer orders will remain uneven,  adding to earnings volatility.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook are supported by Fitch's expectations for: --Significant liquid crystal display (LCD) glass share leadership and strong  market positions in fiber for telecom, and ceramic filters for automotive  applications; --Technology leadership from significant cumulative RD&E investments, resulting  in strong operating EBITDA margin in the low- to mid-30s; --Expectations for annual FCF over the longer term. Concerns center on Corning's: --Potentially limited headroom for operational shortfalls or sustained  macroeconomic headwinds, given commitment to more aggressive financial policies; --Significant ongoing investments in RD&E and capital spending requirements; --Corning's need to offset meaningful annual average selling price (ASP)  reductions in Display and Specialty Materials with manufacturing efficiencies. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Organic sales growth is slightly down for 2015 and flat in 2016, on a constant  currency basis, followed by low-single-digit growth in 2017-2018. --Acquisition spending is $250 million to $500 million annually and adds roughly  0.5% of inorganic growth to the top line per year. --Operating EBITDA margins remain above 30% through the forecast period. --Capital intensity remains in the mid-teens through the forecast period. --Shareholder returns are spread evenly through the forecast period and,  including the $1.25 billion ASR commencing in the current quarter, exceed $10 billion. --Debt increases to support shareholder returns beginning in 2016. RATING   SENSITIVITIES Negative rating actions could occur if Fitch expects: --Total leverage sustained above 2.5x, from structurally lower profitability or  debt issuance to pre-fund shareholder returns in conjunction with a significant  macroeconomic slowdown; or --Expectations for annual free cash flow sustained below $500 million. A return to financial policies consistent with an 'A'-category rating is  unexpected but could result in positive rating action. LIQUIDITY Corning's liquidity as of Sept. 30, 2015 was solid and consisted of: --$5 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, 60% of which  was located outside the U.S.; --Undrawn $2 billion revolving credit facility expiring Sept. 30, 2019. The  facility includes a maximum 50% debt-to-total capital covenant (16.7% at Sept.  30, 2015). Fitch's expectation for solid annual FCF approaching $500 million also supports  liquidity. As of Sept. 30, 2015, total debt was $5.3 billion (including the unrated $1.15  billion of convertible preferred stock after applying 50% equity credit to $2.3  billion of preferred shares issued to Samsung). FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Corning as follows: --Long-term IDR 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured debt rating 'BBB+'; --Senior unsecured RCF 'BBB+'. --Short-term IDR and CP at 'F2'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.
