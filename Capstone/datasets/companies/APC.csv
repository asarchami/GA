0,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 13 Anadarko Petroleum Corp  said it should pay as little as $850 million in damages over the 2005 spinoff of paint materials company Tronox Inc, 94 percent below the maximum amount a federal bankruptcy judge said it might owe.The estimate was provided on Monday, one month after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper in Manhattan said a higher payout of $14.17 billion might be in order because Anadarko's Kerr-McGee Corp unit intended to harm Tronox creditors by saddling the spinoff with unsustainable environmental liabilities.His Dec. 12 decision sent Anadarko's share price down 6.4 percent the next day in part because the oil and gas exploration company and some analysts expected damages would be much lower.Tronox filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2009 and also sued Anadarko and Kerr-McGee, which Anadarko had bought three years earlier, claiming the spinoff was fraudulent because of the environmental liabilities.In his 166-page decision, Gropper concluded that Kerr-McGee ""acted with actual intent to hinder or delay creditors,"" in a spinoff that left Tronox ""insolvent and undercapitalized (and) was not made for reasonably equivalent value.""He said Anadarko might owe between $5.15 billion and $14.17 billion to a litigation trust set up for Tronox creditors. But in a court filing on Monday, Anadarko said Gropper misread Tronox's reorganization plan when determining liability, and that any damages should simply, ""restore the parties to their pre-transfer positions.""Anadarko, which is based in The Woodlands, Texas, said net damages should be $850 million, and no more than $1.76 billion. REMEDIAL, NOT PUNITIVE Gropper's findings are, ""contrary to the court's stated view that the purpose of the applicable law is 'remedial rather than punitive,'"" Anadarko Chief Executive Al Walker said in a statement. ""We continue to reserve all of our objections to the opinion and our right to appeal.""John Hueston, a lawyer for the Tronox litigation trust, said in an email: ""We strenuously disagree with Anadarko's tortured effort to rewrite Judge Gropper's findings and to define a new and lower range of liability.

He said the judge's final decision was likely some months away. ""I would think it's late spring or early summer,"" Reeves added.Anadarko said it expects a probable loss related to potential damages, after all appeals, of $850 million to $5.15 billion. Anadarko has vowed to appeal Gropper's judgment, as well as the question of whether Gropper has the authority to enter a judgment to begin with, an issue that could take years to resolve.

LNG, gas chilled to liquid form for sea transport, is a key fuel source and many Asian nations have been hungry to find steady sources. To develop massive LNG projects though, financiers often require customers to be lined up well in advance.

15,"   By Nick Brown  Energy company Anadarko Petroleum Corp agreed on Thursday to pay more than $5 billion to clean up areas across the United States polluted by nuclear fuel, wood creosote and rocket fuel waste that caused cancer and other health problems.The agreement resolves a long-running lawsuit against the Kerr-McGee energy and chemical company, which Anadarko bought in 2006. The case was brought by a trust representing the U.S. government, 11 state governments, Indian tribes and individuals.The trust was seeking cleanup costs at more than 2,000 sites nationwide.

17,"   By Angela Moon | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Investors who loaded up on bullish options bets in Anadarko Petroleum earlier in the week made some hefty potential profits on Thursday when the global energy company announced a settlement that would end years of litigation over health problems across the United States.Anadarko Petroleum Corp shares hit an all-time high of $100 on Thursday before ending up 14.5 percent at $99.02. The settlement resolved environmental cleanup claims stemming from the 2009 bankruptcy of paint materials maker Tronox brought by a trust for governments, Indian tribes and individuals.The jump in share prices sharply boosted the value of call options that had been trading actively in the last several days ahead of the announcement.""Since the options on Anadarko were not expensive in pure dollar value, for people who have been following the stock and expected some sort of a settlement, the potential reward was worth the potential risk they were putting in,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief strategist with TD Ameritrade in Chicago. Among a slew of bullish bets this week, the most notable trades were the $90 calls that expire later this month.On Tuesday, 15,600 contracts of April $90 calls were traded at between 48 to 80 cents, a significant jump in volume as there were only about 4,491 contracts existing, according to optionMonster.com. The stock closed at $86.56 on Tuesday, more than $10 off the current price. ""Call options that were trading at around 50-70 cents a contract on Tuesday are now trading around $7.50-$8.00. Whoever made the trade just made an awful lot of money,"" Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut.""Someone has been diligent in expecting this to happen but we can't jump to a conclusion that this is suspicious trading,"" he said. While a sudden increase in bets in a particular stock does not indicate there was any wrongdoing, the options market has often been under scrutiny for unusual trades made ahead of a disclosure of a big deal or other news that moves share prices.Options volume in Anadarko Petroleum jumped about 11 times the recent daily average on Thursday with 143,000 calls and 14,000 puts traded, according to options analytics firm, TradeAlert.Among the most active contracts were $105 and $115 calls that expire on May 14. Since call options are generally viewed as bullish, the contracts were mostly based on expectations the stock would rise to those levels by mid-May.(Reporting by Angela Moon; editing by Andrew Hay)",2014-04-03,APC,"Thu Apr 3, 2014 | 6:39pm EDT",Bullish Anadarko options bets soar on settlement news,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-anadarkopete-tronox-settlement-option-idUSBREA321YF20140403?type=companyNews

21,"  * Shell echoes concerns about changes to law* Industry had said move would discourage investors* Explorers interested after nearby Mozambique findsBy George ObulutsaNAIROBI, April 30 U.S. oil and gas explorer Anadarko Petroleum said it halted spending on exploration in South Africa until it has more clarity on changes in the petroleum law, which gives the state a 20 percent stake in new ventures.South Africa's parliament passed the changes to the law last month, a move industry experts said would discourage investment. Other firms have also voiced concerns about the legislation, which gives the mines minister wide-ranging powers to place certain minerals in a ""value-addition"" category, which means a portion would have to be processed domestically instead of exported in raw form.""We have suspended our expenditures in South Africa until the petroleum law and fiscal terms are more clear,"" Tom Fletcher, exploration manager for east Africa at Anadarko, told an energy conference in Nairobi on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters on the conference sidelines, he said: ""We are just looking for a little more clarity - what's going to happen with the fiscal regime down there - before we invest large dollars in South Africa.""Menno de Ruig, Shell's exploration manager for new international upstream business in sub-Saharan Africa, echoed those concerns at the conference.""We are hopeful that the current uncertainty around the petroleum bill in South Africa gets resolved in a workable manner so that we can move forward to the drilling phase,"" he said. The speed at which the bill passed before elections in May alarmed petroleum companies such as Shell, Anadarko, Total  and Exxon Mobil, which want to explore South Africa after making big offshore gas finds in neighbouring Mozambique.Shell has been exploring for shale gas in the onshore Karoo area, while Total said in November it expected to drill its first offshore well in the Outeniqua Basin, about 175 km (110 miles) off the southern coast of South Africa.As well as the 20 percent ""free carried interest"", the government also introduced a clause entitling it to increase its share of a project by acquiring a greater stake at an agreed price or by production-sharing agreements.Industry critics of the law say it amounts to nationalisation without appropriate compensation.

28,"   By Nick Brown | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Anadarko Petroleum Corp's agreement to pay $5.15 billion to clean up nuclear fuel and other pollution moved one step closer to reality on Wednesday, receiving a bankruptcy judge's rubber stamp. The agreement reached in April, touted by the U.S. Department of Justice as the largest-ever environmental cleanup recovery, resolved a lawsuit against Anadarko and its Kerr-McGee unit from creditors of Tronox Inc, the paint materials maker that was once a subsidiary of Kerr-McGee. The lawsuit, which was joined by the DOJ, alleged that Tronox's 2009 bankruptcy was caused by the environmental liabilities it took on when Kerr-McGee spun it off in 2005. It said the spinoff was a scheme by Kerr-McGee to get the liabilities off its books and make itself a more attractive takeover target for Anadarko, which acquired it in 2006.Judge Allan Gropper, in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, presided over Tronox's bankruptcy and the Anadarko lawsuit. He approved the settlement at a hearing on Wednesday over the objections of some smaller claimholders who said the deal did not go far enough.  ""Everybody wins,"" Gropper said. ""I can see only a benefit from the settlement."" The deal will not be official until it gets the approval of a federal district court judge. A lawyer for the Tronox creditors told Reuters he expects that to happen ""within the next few months."" The deal is not expected to face much resistance.Despite the hefty price tag, the settlement is a win for Anadarko shareholders because Gropper had initially estimated that the company's liability could be as high as $14.17 billion. The money will fund a wide array of projects across some 2,000 U.S. sites, including $1.1 billion to address contamination from Kerr-McGee's decades-old jet and rocket fuel manufacturing plant in Henderson, Nevada, where ammonium perchlorate, a primary fuel component, penetrated soil and then groundwater. The Navajo Nation will get about $1 billion to address radioactive contamination from Kerr-McGee’s old uranium mining operation. The lawsuit had also blamed Kerr-McGee’s use of coal tar creosote, which the Environmental Protection Agency has said is a probable cause of cancer.

Despite the hefty price tag, the settlement is a win for Anadarko shareholders because Gropper had initially estimated that the company's liability could be as high as $14.17 billion.The money will fund a wide array of projects across some 2,000 U.S. sites, including $1.1 billion to address contamination from Kerr-McGee's decades-old jet and rocket fuel manufacturing plant in Henderson, Nevada, where ammonium perchlorate, a primary fuel component, penetrated soil and then groundwater. The Navajo Nation will get about $1 billion to address radioactive contamination from Kerr-McGee's old uranium mining operation.

30,"   By Jessica Dye  A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday said BP Plc and Anadarko Petroleum Corp must face penalties under federal pollution laws in connection with the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, which could expose the companies to billions of dollars in potential fines. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a 2012 decision from U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans that the companies could be held liable for civil penalties under the Clean Water Act.BP and Anadarko owned a respective 65 percent and 25 percent of the Macondo well that was drilled by Deepwater Horizon, which blew out in 2010 and resulted in a massive oil spill.  The companies had appealed Barbier’s ruling, arguing in part that they should not be responsible for oil spilled as a result of failed equipment on the drilling rig, which was owned by Transocean Ltd.  But as co-owners of the well, BP and Anadarko would be on the hook for resulting fines, the appeals court ruled. A spokeswoman for BP declined to comment.

Transocean agreed last year to pay the U.S. government $1 billion in civil penalties over the spill.

32,"  * BP, Anadarko, IBV are partners in areas hit by writedown* Maersk sells 40 pct of Polvo field to Brazil's HRT* Writedown questions Maersk's oil strategy, analyst says   (Adds Wood Mackenzie analyst on Brazil's subsalt plays, paragraphs 8-12)By Ole Mikkelsen and Jeb BlountCOPENHAGEN/RIO DE JANEIRO, July 8 Danish oil and shipping group A.P. Moller-Maersk moved to shrink its Brazilian petroleum operations on Tuesday, selling its stake in its only producing Brazilian oilfield and saying it will write off $1.7 billion of investments in the country.The write-off affects two exploration areas, Itaipu and Wahoo, which failed to deliver on oil volume expectations, and the Polvo field, both northeast of Rio de Janeiro in the Campos Basin, Maersk said.Maersk bought the assets from South Korea's SK Energy Co Ltd for $2.4 billion in 2011. On Tuesday, Brazil's HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA said it bought Maersk's 40 percent Polvo stake for an undisclosed sum.If Maersk's assessment of Itaipu and Wahoo is correct, its Brazilian retreat could be followed by its partners in these areas: Britain's BP Plc, U.S.-based Anadarko Petroleum Co  and India's IBV Brasil SA, a joint venture between Videocon Industries Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corp . ""There was significantly less oil than we had expected,"" Chief Executive Nils Smedegaard Andersen told reporters on a conference call. ""In addition, the expectation for the price of oil back in 2011 was more optimistic than today.""The CEO said Maersk's move comes as Brazilian exploration and production costs soar. BP declined to comment, Anadarko and IBV officials could not be reached for comment.Such costs have helped cool a Brazilian offshore oil boom that began with the 2007 announcement of giant, offshore fields near Rio. Since then stagnant oil production, increased government control and regulatory uncertainty have undermined the value of the country's oil resources and the shares of Brazilian oil companies such as state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA .The Campos Basin lies next to the Santos Basin, which holds prolific fields such as Jupiter, Tupi and Libra. These gave rise to a flurry of international interest in Brazilian subsalt oil - reservoirs that lie underneath layers of salt. The Campos basin had been seen as riskier, however, said Wood Mackenzie's head of Latin America upstream research, Ivan Cima.""There's always been a big question mark over how good the Campos Basin is going to be,"" Cima said.""The Campos Basin has not been as prolific as the Santos, where we recently saw very good results,"" he said, adding the energy consulting group now had to rework its estimates of the reserves in the two plays. ""As of this morning, our estimates have been thrown out of the window.""The writedown didn't affect the Maersk Group's guidance for an underlying profit of about $4 billion in 2014.Smedegaard Andersen described Itaipu and Wahoo's appraisal results as ""clearly unsatisfactory."" Jyske Bank analyst Frans Hoyer questioned the company's longer-term oil ambitions.""This is more a question of how to assess Maersk's ability to succeed in the oil sector,"" Hoyer said. ""I think that strategy is being questioned today.""Maersk has a target of 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2020. It produced 235,000 bpd last year. The group received an average of 4,219 bpd from its 40 percent of Polvo in May, less than 2 pct of 2013 output.Group oil production has fallen since 2005 as older North Sea fields decline. Maersk now spends $3-$5 billion a year developing new fields in Qatar, Kazakhstan, Algeria and Britain.Its shares fell 1.4 percent to 13,420 Danish crowns.

Gwin said the company was looking at a number of ways to accelerate the value of its minerals rights. The company already benefits by leasing mineral acreage to others to drill, he noted.Another oil and gas producer, Apache Corp, has told Reuters it may look at options to unlock the value of its mineral rights. Two successful deals have stirred interest among investors in mineral rights. Viper Energy Partners LP and Canada's Prairie Sky Royalty Ltd this year have bundled the royalties generated by their mineral rights into subsidiaries and then listed them in public offerings.

""We want to become a resource-focused company.""Brightoil, whose international oil trading and bunkering businesses have been hit hard by the global financial crisis, is moving to transform itself into an upstream-focusd company.It is already in talks for potential acquisitions of oil and gas-producing assets in China, and once an acquisition agreement is reached, Brightoil would fund it with both debt and equity capital, Yung said. The Hong Kong-listed company does not rule out the possibility of issuing new shares, he said, adding that Sit Kwong Lam, Brightoil's founder and chairman, does not object to the dilution of his nearly 75 percent stake due to any new share offer.""He certainly does not mind to see a dilution of his stake, as long as he remains the majority shareholder of the company,"" Yung said. Brightoil said in February that it had agreed to buy Anadarko Petroleum's stakes in two oil blocks in Bohai Bay off China's northeast coast. It completed the deal, mostly funded with debt, last week.More U.S. oil companies are seeking to sell their oilfield stakes in China and elsewhere to raise capital to develop shale oil projects at home, Yung said. The shift in strategy is coinciding with an expiry of some of their oilfield production sharing contracts in China, under which they must shift the operatorship of the oilfields back to China - making the projects less attractive to the foreign companies.""This is offering us a great window of opportunity,"" said Yung, an energy industry veteran who has held management positions at international energy firms like BP and British Gas.

42,"  * Anadarko and Eni developing Rovuma Basin gas reserves* ""Special regime"" approved to boost LNG investments* Mozambique prefers onshore LNG plantsBy Manuel MucariPEMBA, Mozambique, Aug 21 More than $30 billion will be invested initially in Mozambique's natural gas sector to build capacity to produce 20 million tonnes per year of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with the first exports due to start in 2018, the national oil company said.The investments will be made to develop the northern ports of Pemba and Palma, where a giant logistics base and LNG production plants are planned that will use gas produced from offshore fields in the Rovuma Basin being developed by U.S. oil major Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Italy's Eni.Mozambique, which still bears the scars of a 1975-1992 civil war, is hoping revenues from its large gas deposits and its fledgling coal mining industry will help it emerge from years of poverty and dependence on foreign donors.The country holds presidential elections on Oct. 15.""In an initial phase, liquefaction units with a total capacity for 20 million tonnes a year of LNG will be built and operated. The investment to be made tops $30 billion,"" Nelson Ocuane, president of the state oil company ENH, told Reuters.The initial exports from 2018 will come from a first LNG train of 5 million tonnes a year, with overall capacity for the industry to be ramped up subsequently to 20 million tonnes per year.Ocuane, speaking on the sidelines of the launch of the project for the Pemba port logistics base on Wednesday, did not give a detailed breakdown of who would make the investments, between foreign partners, the government and state entities. Anadarko and Eni's commitments already run into several billions of dollars, but Ocuane's estimate was the first to put an overall cost tag on the first phase of Mozambique's LNG ambitions.Mozambique's parliament last week approved amended legislation for the gas and oil sector, including a ""special regime"" for LNG development in Rovuma Basin Areas 1 and 4 where Anadarko and Eni are operating. This covered the construction and operation of LNG facilities and related activities.Government officials have said this regime, aimed at attracting investment, includes the possibility of certain ""exemptions"" in contracts, but these have not been specified.""Mozambique has good conditions to start exporting in 2018 because all the investment plans indicate that the essential infrastructure will be in place by then,"" Ocuane said.Officials say fresh bidding rounds for Mozambican gas and oil concessions would be held in the coming months. The International Monetary Fund, which sees Mozambique's economy growing 8 percent annually in the medium term - one of the highest rates in Africa - has said the country can expect ""substantial revenues"" from LNG by 2022.But it says Mozambique faces risks from climate disasters, commodity price shocks and variations in global demand for its coal and gas, as well as ""financing risks for megaprojects"".Some industry analysts say Mozambique may struggle to meet its target date of 2018 for the start of LNG exports. They say it must develop its LNG potential by the end of this decade as other supplies come on the market from West and East Africa and the global supply/demand scenario shifts, with the United States moving from energy importer to exporter.Of the world's LNG, about 70 percent is consumed by China, South Korea, India, Japan and Taiwan, and Ocuane said it was these Asian customers Mozambique would aim to supply.Around 180 trillion cubic feet of gas has been found in Mozambique's offshore Rovuma Basin. This would be enough to supply Germany, Britain, France and Italy for 18 years. MOZAMBIQUE ""PREFERS"" ONSHORE LNG PLANTS Italy's Eni has proposed constructing two floating offshore LNG plants to process gas from its Rovuma Basin area, which would be quicker to complete than an onshore facility.Ocuane said Mozambique's government was giving technical consideration to the Eni proposal, and would give its answer ""in due course"".But he added: ""The government prefers the construction of LNG units onshore because this has the potential of creating employment and allowing the possibility of a series of investments in support areas for the gas industry.""Under the new legislation for the sector, foreign operators who win licences to explore for oil and gas must do so in partnership with state oil company ENH. The law also says that 25 percent of all gas and oil produced should go to the domestic market.Anne Fruhauf, Senior Vice-President for Africa for New York-based Teneo Intelligence, said the legislation ""reflects key political priorities, namely industrial development, local procurement and a stronger role for national oil company ENH.""""For investors the planned domestic market obligation (DMO) - targeting 25 percent of petroleum companies' production - will be one of the most controversial aspects of the legislation,"" she said in emailed comments. She expected further details of the operating framework to be defined in secondary regulations.Mozambique recently set up a public company, Portos de Cabo Delgado, bringing together the state rail operator, CFM, and the national oil company to develop the northern LNG infrastructure.The sub-concession for the Pemba port development has been given to ENHILS (ENH Integrated Logistics Services), a joint venture between ENH subsidiary ENH Logistics, which holds 51 percent, and Orlean Invest, a Nigerian company, with 49 percent.

43,"  (Recasts with Mitsubishi's announcement)TOKYO, Sept 12 Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp is buying a 20 percent stake in an offshore oilfield in Ivory Coast from U.S. firm Anadarko Petroleum , in what will be the first Japanese oilfield stake purchase in the African country.Mitsubishi said in a statement on Friday it is buying the stake in the deepwater oilfield block CI-103, located about 50 km (31 miles) off the coast of Cote d'Ivoire. It declined to comment on the value of the stake.Anadarko currently controls 55 percent of the block, while London-based Tullow Oil and Ivorian state oil company Petroci have 30 percent and 15 percent, respectively. The Nikkei business daily earlier said the project could cost 800 billion yen ($7.46 billion), but a Mitsubishi spokesman termed it speculation.Ivory Coast, French-speaking West Africa's largest economy,  is seeking to accelerate development of its energy sector, neglected during a decade-long political crisis that ended in a brief civil war in 2011. The oil ministry signed 18 production-sharing agreements in 18 months in 2012 and 2013, as investors bet it could emulate Ghana's hydrocarbons boom. Companies such as Anadarko drilled 10 wells last year alone - twice the number during the whole of the decade-long political crisis. Mitsubishi said crude production from the oilfield is targeted to begin in 2019.

45,"   By Mike Stone  Anadarko Petroleum Corp is evaluating the sale of its stake in the Salt Creek oil field in Wyoming and hopes to fetch more than $2 billion for the asset, people following the situation said.The people, who asked not to be named because the talks were private, said Anadarko recently began reaching out to prospective buyers to probe interest.A representative for The Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko declined to comment. Anadarko is an independent oil and gas exploration company with global operations. Houston Texas-based Linn Energy, LLC is a 23 percent owner in the field through a 2012 joint-venture which cost Linn $600 million. At the time of the joint-venture with Linn, Anadarko said there were about 1 billion gross barrels of oil beneath the ground and that Anadarko expected $34 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization within the first year of the joint project.The Salt Creek field, located in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, utilizes an extraction method where carbon dioxide is pumped into the ground at high pressure to enhance oil recovery. Anadarko's sale of the Salt Creek field would represent its partial exit from carbon dioxide assisted oil recovery, which company presentations show are used at the Monell field in Wyoming as well. One of the people said prospective bidders could include Denbury Resources Inc another oil and gas company which uses carbon dioxide to assist in its oil extraction process. Denbury is based in Plano, Texas and has a market capitalization of $5 billion.  A representative for Denbury did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One of the people said Merit Energy Company's May 7 sale of its 25 percent interest in non-operated producing oil wells in the Rangely field of northwest Colorado to Atlas Resource Partners LP may have been a catalyst for Anadarko's decision to monetize its Wyoming property. Atlas Resource Partners paid $420 million for total reserves of approximately 47 million barrels of oil equivalent, including proved developed producing reserves of approximately 25 million barrels of oil equivalent. According to Atlas, production for the first quarter of 2014 was 2,900 barrels per day of oil equivalent with about 90 percent being oil, and the balance as natural gas liquids. Chevron is the operating partner in the Rangely field play where Atlas invested.

49,"  MEXICO CITY Oct 8 Anadarko Petroleum Corp , one of the largest oil and gas producers in the booming Eagle Ford shale formation in south Texas, does not for now plan to develop Mexican projects across the border, a company executive said on Wednesday.Mexico recently enacted a sweeping energy overhaul that ended a 75-year monopoly of state-owned oil company Pemex  and paves the way for private oil majors to compete for development rights both onshore and offshore.""We're staying out of onshore"" in Mexico, said Tim Tirlia, Anadarko's international exploration drilling manager.Asked about his remarks shortly afterwards, Tirlia rowed back somewhat, saying Anadarko had ruled nothing out.""We're still evaluating (onshore projects), but we're heavily focused on deep water opportunities here,"" he added. Tirlia declined to comment on whether security concerns in northern Mexico, which is prone to lawlessness and where drug cartels have a strong presence, would make projects too costly.In July, an executive with Lewis Energy, another top Eagle Ford producer that has operations in northern Mexico, said its costs are about 30 percent higher south of the border in part because of additional security needs. Anadarko, an independent U.S.-based oil and gas company with operations in over a dozen countries, mostly operates offshore internationally, Tirlia said.Mexico's first international public tender next year will include potentially lucrative deep water blocks in the Perdido Fold Belt in the Gulf of Mexico. It will also include several onshore fields just across the U.S. border in the Sabinas basin, as well as more onshore blocks in the Chicontepec basin further south.In U.S. territorial waters of the Gulf, Anadarko owns an average 63 percent working interest in over 400 blocks where it operates six platforms, the company's 2013 annual report said.Pemex, currently the only operator in Mexico's half of the Gulf's deep waters, has four platforms there, but has yet to achieve any commercial deep water production.

Earlier this week, U.S. crude oil dropped to the lowest level in more than two years, below $80 per barrel.

56,"   By Nick Brown | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Anadarko Petroleum Corp's agreement to pay $5.15 billion to clean up nuclear fuel and other pollution received approval from a federal judge on Monday, the final hurdle for the settlement touted by the U.S. Department of Justice as the largest-ever environmental cleanup recovery. The agreement, reached in April, resolved a lawsuit against Anadarko and its Kerr-McGee unit from creditors of Tronox Inc, the paint materials maker that was once a unit of Kerr-McGee. Opponents of the settlement could still appeal, but would face tough odds given its broad support among the parties in the case. Barring an appeal, money could be dispersed ""within weeks,"" John Hueston, a lawyer for the Tronox creditors, said in an interview on Monday. The lawsuit, which was joined by the U.S. Department of Justice, alleged Tronox's 2009 bankruptcy was caused by the environmental liabilities it took on when Kerr-McGee spun it off in 2005. It said the spinoff was a scheme by Kerr-McGee to get the liabilities off its books and make itself a more attractive takeover target for Anadarko, which acquired it in 2006. The money will fund a wide array of projects across some 2,000 U.S. sites, including $1 billion for the Navajo Nation to address radioactive contamination from Kerr-McGee's old uranium mining operation.The bankruptcy judge who oversaw Tronox's Chapter 11 case and presided over the trial, green-lighted the deal in May.  Manhattan federal Judge Katherine Forrest approved the deal on Monday over objections from a creditor group in Columbus, Mississippi, where Kerr-McGee operated a wood treatment plant. The group felt the settlement was too low. ""The court is sympathetic to the objectors, whose community is coping with the toxic legacy Kerr-McGee has left in its wake,"" Forrest wrote.

57,"   By Nick Brown | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 10 Anadarko Petroleum Corp's  agreement to pay $5.15 billion to clean up nuclear fuel and other pollution received approval from a federal judge on Monday, the final hurdle for the settlement touted by the U.S. Department of Justice as the largest-ever environmental cleanup recovery.The agreement, reached in April, resolved a lawsuit against Anadarko and its Kerr-McGee unit from creditors of Tronox Inc, the paint materials maker that was once a unit of Kerr-McGee.Opponents of the settlement could still appeal, but would face tough odds given its broad support among the parties in the case. Barring an appeal, money could be dispersed ""within weeks,"" John Hueston, a lawyer for the Tronox creditors, said in an interview on Monday. The lawsuit, which was joined by the U.S. Department of Justice, alleged Tronox's 2009 bankruptcy was caused by the environmental liabilities it took on when Kerr-McGee spun it off in 2005. It said the spinoff was a scheme by Kerr-McGee to get the liabilities off its books and make itself a more attractive takeover target for Anadarko, which acquired it in 2006.The money will fund a wide array of projects across some 2,000 U.S. sites, including $1 billion for the Navajo Nation to address radioactive contamination from Kerr-McGee's old uranium mining operation. The bankruptcy judge who oversaw Tronox's Chapter 11 case and presided over the trial, green-lighted the deal in May.Manhattan federal Judge Katherine Forrest approved the deal on Monday over objections from a creditor group in Columbus, Mississippi, where Kerr-McGee operated a wood treatment plant. The group felt the settlement was too low. ""The court is sympathetic to the objectors, whose community is coping with the toxic legacy Kerr-McGee has left in its wake,"" Forrest wrote. ""Nevertheless, the court must consider the broad interests of all the parties.""An attorney for the objectors did not return a call seeking comment on Monday.Tronox emerged from bankruptcy in 2011.

58,"  * 2015 LNG import target at 5 mln T, with a downside risk* Imports from Anadarko's Mozambique project seen up to 2.3 mln T   (Adds detail and comment)RAYONG, Thailand Jan 8 Thailand's PTT PCL  said on Thursday it is planning to more than double its imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) this year compared to last, partly to help replace potential declines in pipeline imports from Myanmar.Natural gas is used for almost 70 percent of Thailand's power generation. About one quarter of those supplies are piped in from Myanmar, although those contracts are winding down and Thailand's neighbour is expected to use more of its natural gas resources for its own development.The plans for the increase in LNG import volumes to 5 million tonnes a year come after PTT, Thailand's only gas supplier, cut LNG targets last year as demand slowed after months of domestic political unrest.""There's still a downside risk to our LNG import target for this year, and it could fall to just 3 million tonnes, due to a weak domestic economy and poor gas demand overall,"" PTT CEO Pailin Chuchottaworn told reporters. PTT was on Thursday taking delivery of a 90,000-tonne cargo of LNG from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company Limited, the first shipment in a 20-year contract to import 2 million tonnes a year from the Middle Eastern nation, a company statement said.Thailand's imports of LNG last year came in around 2 million tonnes, only partially using PTT's $880 million Map Ta Phut LNG facility in the eastern province of Rayong. That import terminal has a capacity of 5 million tonnes a year, and PTT is building a second LNG terminal at the same site and of the same capacity, with completion expected in 2017.As it prepares for falling imports from Myanmar and declining domestic output from the Gulf of Thailand, PTT is also studying a plan to build an LNG receiving terminal adjacent to a gas pipeline linked to gas fields in Myanmar.Such a site on the coast of Myanmar would offer a more convenient delivery point for LNG from Middle East suppliers. PTT CEO Pailin said the price of the first Qatar Gas cargo was attractive, close to the $10 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) that PTT pays for natural gas from Myanmar.The Qatar Gas contract is linked to global oil prices, and CEO Pailin expects LNG delivery costs to fall under $10 per mmBtu over the next one or two months.PTT expected to conclude talks soon to buy up to 2.3 million  tonnes a year of LNG from Anadarko Petroleum Corp's  planned export plant in Mozambique, Pailin also told reporters.Pailin said PTT was still in talks with several other LNG suppliers in the United States, Australia and Russia to secure long-term supplies.

60,"   By Jonathan Stempel  BP Plc and Anadarko Petroleum Corp  narrowly failed to persuade a U.S appeals court to reconsider its 2014 ruling that they could face civil fines under federal pollution laws over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.By a 7-6 vote, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals let stand a three-judge panel's decision to uphold a 2012 ruling from U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans, in which he said the companies could face Clean Water Act penalties.Barbier is scheduled on Jan. 20 to begin a non-jury trial to determine pollution fines.

75,"   By Oleg Vukmanovic , Dmitry Zhdannikov and Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen | MILAN/LONDON/SINGAPORE  MILAN/LONDON/SINGAPORE Anadarko Petroleum is considering selling its multi-billion dollar stake in Mozambique's giant gas reserves, with Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] both showing interest, banking and industry sources said. Exxon is seen as the front runner, and it would be its first big acquisition since the oil price collapse. The world's largest oil firm has been expected to follow the example of Royal Dutch Shell, which agreed to buy BG Group for $70 billion last week.Anadarko, which has opened its data rooms to investors keen to get a more detailed picture of its reserves, could sell up to its full 26.5 percent stake in Mozambique's offshore Area 1 license in the Rovuma Basin, the sources said.The last stake sold, 10 pct, went for $2.64 billion in 2013 to India's ONGC, but that was seen as overpriced and oil and gas prices have since fallen sharply, making it hard to value Anadarko's remaining asset.  Area 1 holds over 75 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, enough to meet over four years of total European gas demand.Anadarko initially planned to build a major liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project in Mozambique fed by Area 1 reserves and targeting Asian markets, but the sale process calls that into question and suggests the task will pass to whoever picks up the stake. Exxon, which operates a diverse LNG portfolio, is the likely front-runner after Shell dropped out following its planned merger with BG Group, which will give it access to large gas assets in neighboring Tanzania, according to one senior oil banker.Three other sources said Exxon and Qatar Petroleum had visited Anadarko's data rooms to get a closer look at reserve breakdowns and reservoir geology. An Exxon Mobil spokesman said: ""We never comment on speculation or potential business opportunities.""Anadarko said it does not comment on market speculation, as did Shell. Qatar Petroleum, which is itself consolidating after the plunge in oil prices, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.PRIZED ASSETS Plummeting oil prices may have pushed Anadarko to review one of its most prized assets, one of the sources said. But it is unclear if the Houston-based firm is in any hurry to reach a deal or if it plans to offload its full stake.

76,"  * Exxon Mobil front-runner for Mozambique LNG stake-sources* Shell dropped out after BG merger plan-sourcesBy Oleg Vukmanovic , Dmitry Zhdannikov and Jacob Gronholt-PedersenMILAN/LONDON/SINGAPORE, April 16 Anadarko Petroleum is considering selling its multi-billion dollar stake in Mozambique's giant gas reserves, with  Exxon Mobil and Qatar Petroleum both showing interest, banking and industry sources said.Exxon is seen as the front runner, and it would be its first big acquisition since the oil price collapse. The world's largest oil firm has been expected to follow the example of Royal Dutch Shell, which agreed to buy BG Group  for $70 billion last week.Anadarko, which has opened its data rooms to investors keen to get a more detailed picture of its reserves, could sell up to its full 26.5 percent stake in Mozambique's offshore Area 1 license in the Rovuma Basin, the sources said.The last stake sold, 10 pct, went for $2.64 billion in 2013 to India's ONGC, but that was seen as overpriced and oil and gas prices have since fallen sharply, making it hard to value Anadarko's remaining asset.Area 1 holds over 75 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas, enough to meet over four years of total European gas demand.Anadarko initially planned to build a major liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project in Mozambique fed by Area 1 reserves and targeting Asian markets, but the sale process calls that into question and suggests the task will pass to whoever picks up the stake. Exxon, which operates a diverse LNG portfolio, is the likely front-runner after Shell dropped out following its planned merger with BG Group, which will give it access to large gas assets in neighbouring Tanzania, according to one senior oil banker.Three other sources said Exxon and Qatar Petroleum had visited Anadarko's data rooms to get a closer look at reserve breakdowns and reservoir geology.An Exxon Mobil spokesman said: ""We never comment on speculation or potential business opportunities.""Anadarko said it does not comment on market speculation, as did Shell. Qatar Petroleum, which is itself consolidating after the plunge in oil prices, did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. PRIZED ASSETS Plummeting oil prices may have pushed Anadarko to review one of its most prized assets, one of the sources said. But it is unclear if the Houston-based firm is in any hurry to reach a deal or if it plans to offload its full stake.""There are variants"" as to how much it will sell, said a banker.It is not the first high-quality asset to go on the block.

77,"  (Adds details on plans to resume well completions later this year, Concho and Anadarko material; updates stock)By Ernest ScheyderWILLISTON, N.D. May 4 Oil and natural gas producer EOG Resources Inc plans to begin fracking hundreds of wells in North Dakota and Texas later this year if oil prices stabilize around $65 per barrel, executives said on Monday after reporting a better-than-expected adjusted profit.EOG was the latest major U.S. shale oil producer to peg increased operations to a specific dollar amount, a positive sign for an industry worried that last year's price drop would permanently cripple growth.Whiting Petroleum Corp said last week it would add drilling rigs to its portfolio if crude prices rise to $70 per barrel, and Pioneer Natural Resources Co told Reuters last month it was considering adding new rigs this year as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) prices rebound.EOG, considered a leader in the U.S. shale oil industry, has for months drilled new wells only to keep them idle by delaying fracking, part of a strategy to hold back pumping some crude after a roughly 40 percent drop in prices since last summer. Crude prices have inched up in the past month.EOG executives said Wall Street should expect the company's 2015 production to resemble the letter ""U"" - falling in the first half of the year, then rebounding in the second half and hitting double-digits by next year. RESULTS BEAT EOG posted a first-quarter net loss of $169.7 million, or 31 cents per share, in the first quarter compared with net income of $660.9 million, or $1.21 per share, in the year-ago period.Factoring in hedging gains and other one-time items, EOG earned 3 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings to break even, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.It was the continuation of a theme for U.S. shale oil producers, including Whiting and Hess Corp, who have aggressively curtailed spending and relied in varying degrees on hedges all quarter.Production volumes rose 5 percent to 589,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day.EOG shares fell about 0.8 percent to $98.65 in after-hours trading.Elsewhere on Monday, EOG rival Anadarko Petroleum Co  reported record quarterly production, and Concho Resources Inc  raised its 2015 production outlook by 18 to 22 percent, citing technological improvements, after a 50 percent cut to its rig fleet.

More broadly, geopolitical uncertainty has caused crude oil prices to climb back to around $60 a barrel, up more than 30 percent from the year's lows. That rally has sparked talk of a recovery and prompted questions about which exploration and production companies are best prepared to get back to work after slashing budgets as much as 50 percent.Walker said Anadarko was taking a cautious approach and would need to see sustained higher crude prices to return to growth mode. ""I think this will be one of the last companies you see trying to grow in a market where there's as much uncertainty as we believe there is,"" he said. In March Anadarko said it was drilling but not completing an inventory of about 125 wells, a strategy it was taking to be ready to quickly bring on production when crude oil prices recovered.Now, the Houston-based company told investors on its conference call, it would add another 25 drilled but not completed wells to its inventory if prices did not recover for a sustained period of time.Shares of Anadarko, which reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss on Monday, fell 26 cents to $93.49 in late morning New York Stock Exchange trading.

Statoil and Exxon Mobil have said they will consider bidding in the tenders for the Silistar and Teres offshore blocks which cover an area of 7,000 and 4,000 square kilometres respectively.The two are close to the Neptune block in Romanian Black Sea waters, where Austria's OMV's has said it could produce up to 84 billion of cubic metres of gas. Royal Dutch Shell and the Turkish Petroleum Corporation have also started deepwater exploration in Turkish waters of the Black Sea, just a few kilometres from the Silistar and Teres blocks, Dobrev said. This, and initial soft tests of the two blocks has raised Bulgaria's hopes of finding oil and gas deposits and diversifying its gas supplies which are currently come almost entirely from Russian gas exporter Gazprom.The Balkan country hopes to issue 5-year permits for exploratory drilling.France's Total along with Austria's OMV  and Spain's Repsol are expected to start drilling for oil and gas in the Han Asparuh offshore block, Bulgaria's largest, in the first quarter of 2016.

It also aims to boost competitiveness by diversifying crude sources and cutting import costs. ""Given low oil prices and the cost pressure on shale companies, we are actively looking for business chances,"" SK Innovation's chief executive and president Chung Chul-khil told a press meeting.SK Innovation via its U.S.-based unit SK E&P America in April of last year started to develop U.S. oil fields by acquiring two assets, one each in Oklahoma and Texas, for a combined 387 billion won ($350 million).SK Innovation now considers the period from the third quarter this year to early next year a good time to acquire additional U.S. assets, and expects an increasing number of offers from producers hit by low oil prices, said Ki-tae Kim, president of exploration and production (E&P). Global crude prices  tumbled from last year's mid-June peaks due to a supply glut, losing as much as 60 percent of their value and pressuring high-cost producers particular in U.S. shale developments.Kim said exploration properties in the Anadarko Basin - which stretches across the western part of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle - would be a good fit since the company already has operations in the region. SK Innovation's investments last year in Oklahoma and Texas were its first in the United States since beginning its overseas E&P business in 1983, according to its web site (www.skinnovation.com).SK Innovation suffered its first loss in decades in the fourth quarter of 2014, although better margins over January to March amid weak global oil prices helped it swing back to a profit of 321 billion won.The statement, quoting its chief executive Chung, also said that for its chemical business its growth strategy would focus on the Chinese market.The company said it hoped its forward investment and development plans would triple its domestic stock market value to 30 trillion Korean won ($27 billion) by 2018.

Anadarko and Jera are in talks over a long-term gas import deal, three industry sources said.A Jera spokesman said the venture is in talks with various firms on new supplies but could not give details on individual projects due to confidentiality agreements.""Anadarko are in talks with Jera to discuss potential Mozambique sales,"" one of the sources said. The move shows how Jera's bulk purchasing power could be a swing factor in decisions on LNG projects that require huge investment and large long-term contracts to ensure viability.Last year Anadarko had allotted two-thirds of the capacity of its planned 10 mtpa Mozambique LNG project, but needed more before taking a final investment decision, which is still pending.Anadarko spokesman John Christiansen said the project has more than 8 mtpa of LNG signed in non-binding deals, up on 2014 levels.""We are progressing to long-term SPAs (sales and purchase agreements) with multiple customers in Asian markets, and we continue to make good progress with our marketing efforts,"" Christiansen said. Jera already handles all new long-term fuel purchases for Tepco and Chubu. From next year it will also handle all existing LNG supply contracts and purchases, amounting to 40 mtpa.Anadarko last year also signed a non-binding agreement with Japanese utility Toho Gas for 0.3 mtpa of Mozambican LNG, two industry sources said.A Toho Gas spokesman said Mozambique was a strong candidate for new supplies and is one of the projects it is talking to, but declined to say whether it had signed a non-binding deal, citing confidentiality.China's CNOOC, Indonesia's Pertamina, the United Arab Emirates, Thailand's PTT and Singapore are in talks with Anadarko.(Editing by Dale Hudson)",2015-06-25,APC,"Thu Jun 25, 2015 | 11:08am EDT",Anadarko in talks with Japanese JV Jera for Mozambique LNG deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/mozambique-lng-anadarko-petrol-idUSL8N0Z92O120150625?type=companyNews

90,"  (Adds background on case, paragraphs 3-11)By Lawrence HurleyWASHINGTON, June 29 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected bids by BP Plc and Anadarko Petroleum Corp to avoid penalties under federal pollution law in connection with the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.The high court left in place a June 2014 ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which said the companies were liable for civil penalties under the federal Clean Water Act.The April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion and Macondo oil well rupture killed 11 workers and caused the largest offshore environmental disaster in U.S. history, polluting large parts of the Gulf, killing marine wildlife and harming businesses. BP could face a maximum penalty of $13.7 billion under the Clean Water Act. Anadarko says it could be required to pay more than $1 billion.U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier in New Orleans has not yet imposed penalties, but has ruled that BP was grossly negligent and that 3.19 million barrels of oil were spilled. Overall, BP has incurred more than $42 billion in costs for the spill, including cleanup, fines and victim compensation.BP and Anadarko owned a respective 65 percent and 25 percent of the Macondo well. The companies had argued in part that they should not be responsible for oil spilled as a result of failed equipment on the drilling rig, which was owned by Transocean Ltd.As co-owners of the well, BP and Anadarko would be on the hook for resulting fines, the appeals court ruled.Transocean agreed last year to pay the U.S. government $1 billion in civil penalties over the spill.The cases are BP Exploration and Production Inc. v. U.S. and Anadarko Petroleum Corp v. U.S., U.S. Supreme Court, Nos 14-1217 and 14-1167.

92,"  (Corrects profit excluding items to 1 cent per share in paragraph 9)July 28 U.S. oil and gas company Anadarko Petroleum Corp on Tuesday reported a drop in profit, but results topped Wall Street expectations as the oil and natural gas company improved drilling practices and produced more crude than expected.Oil prices have tumbled about 40 percent from a year earlier, hit by worries about Chinese demand and fresh supply from Iran and mounting inventories.In response, independent exploration and production companies including Anadarko have cut spending and focused on drilling cheaper, more efficient wells in shale basins.""During the second quarter, we delivered more than 18,000 barrels per day of higher-margin oil sales volumes above our guidance, driven by continued improvements in productivity and ongoing operating efficiencies,"" said Anadarko Chairman, President and CEO Al Walker. Anadarko said it increased oil sales by about 30 percent year over year when adjusting for asset sales. The gains were driven by crude from shale fields in Colorado and Texas.Operating improvements have boosted the company's cash margins, allowing Anadarko to drill more than 100 additional wells this year, the company said. The Houston company had a quarterly profit of $61 million, or 12 cents per share, compared with a profit of $227 million, or 45 cents a share in the same period a year earlier.Excluding one-time items related to hedging, Anadarko had a profit of 1 cent per share. Analysts on average had expected Anadarko to report a loss of 51 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Anadarko's daily sales volume of oil and natural gas was about flat compared with a year earlier at 846,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd).Anadarko also said it liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique continues to advance and contractors have been chosen for initial development of onshore facilities.Shares in Anadarko were flat at $72.85 in trade after the market's closing bell.

94,"  (Adds background on LNG project, conference call details)HOUSTON, July 29 Anadarko Petroleum Corp  has no interest in selling down its stake in a planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday, following talk of international interest in the southern African country's gas reserves.The Houston company's desire to sell some of its interest in the project ""approaches zero,"" CEO Al Walker told investors on a conference call to discuss second-quarter earnings.Anadarko would like to be the operator on the multi-billion dollar project, so reducing its stake would put that status into question, said Walker.There has been talk of intense interest in Mozambique's gas reserves from national oil companies and the world's largest oil companies. Anadarko has a 26.5 percent stake in the Area 1 license in the Rovuma Basin offshore Mozambique. Anadarko's master limited partnership (MLP), Western Gas Partners LP, will provide capital to fund development in Mozambique, not from its cash from operations, Walker told investors.Crude prices have tumbled about 20 percent since June 23, hit by growing inventories, worries about demand from China and expectations for Iran's re-entry into the crude market following the nuclear deal. That slide is prompting oil and gas companies to take a more cautious view of the remainder of year.Anadarko does not expect a recovery in prices and does not plan to accelerate its drilling plans, executives told investors. ""We'll continue the focus on the next six months by improving our cash margins and creating value in our portfolio,"" said Walker.After the close of trading on Tuesday, Anadarko reported a profit that topped Wall Street expectations on higher-than-expected oil output and lower costs. .Shares of Anadarko climbed more than 5 percent to $76.77 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading.

Roy, head of business development at Oil India Ltd.. ""The outlook is upbeat,"" he said.Iran has asked Indian firms to submit a development plan for the Farzad-B gas field, Roy said, adding Tehran had offered a draft contract, known as the Iran Petroleum Contract (IPC), to Indian companies.The new contract for the block is a mix of production sharing and service contract, he said. The delegation also renewed talks over the purchase of Iranian liquefied natural gas (LNG) once sanctions against the country are lifted and Tehran sets up a liquefaction facility, Indian oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan told lawmakers on Wednesday.India signed a deal with Iran in 2005 to buy 5 million tonnes a year of LNG but the contract was never implemented.Separately, Oil India said the first delivery of LNG cargo from Mozambique's offshore Area 1 Block in the Rovuma basis was expected in the first quarter of 2020. ""There is a delay of 7-8 months in LNG supplies from Mozambique, as their parliament only recently passed the law supporting development of (an) LNG hub,"" Roy said.He said Mozambique's Area 1-operator Anadarko Petroleum  had signed initial deals with Japan, South Korea and Singapore-based entities to sell 60 percent of the gas to be produced from the phase 1 of the project.Reuters last month reported that Anadarko was in talks with Japanese joint-venture vehicle Jera, set to become the world's biggest buyer of LNG, to sell long-term supply from its Mozambique export scheme.Roy said banks had committed $16 billion for the project that would cost about $23 billion.""The financial closure for the project is expected by the end of this year or early next year,"" he said.The project also include setting up two LNG trains of an annual capacity of 6 million tonnes each.

98,"   By Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Top shale oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD.N) has found an unusual way to both save water and cut costs for its wells: tapping the treated runoff from toilets, sinks and showers in west Texas. Pioneer has signed an 11-year, $117 million deal with the city of Odessa, Texas that will guarantee it access to millions of gallons of treated municipal wastewater each day, for use in nearby oilfields. Deliveries of the so-called effluent, are expected to start at the end of the year.As crude oil has slid to its lowest level in six years - currently about $40 a barrel - oil and gas companies pumping from shale rock have tried to cut every unnecessary penny from their operations. Water acquisition and transportation can be up to 10 percent of the cost of drilling and fracking a well, according to consulting firm IHS.Producers are also trying to mitigate long-term risks of water scarcity in the arid Permian Basin of West Texas, where the top U.S. oilfield is situated.Oil and gas companies operating in area, including Pioneer and Apache Corp (APA.N), have long sought cheaper, more environmentally sound sources of water to use for fracking. For example, both companies have drawn some of the water they use in their operations from the Permian's brackish aquifers, which contain water unfit for drinking. Both companies also have worked to recycle water that is used for frack jobs or found in the ground while drilling. During hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, million of gallons of water are blasted, along with sand and chemicals, into a well drilled through shale or other rocks. The high-pressure slurry cracks the rock, allowing oil and gas to escape and exit the well.Pioneer is the first oil and gas company to sign a long-term wastewater supply contract with Odessa, a city of about 110,000 people. The Dallas-based company recently began construction on a pipeline network that will transport the treated water from the city's sewage plant to one of its oilfields about 20 miles away. ""The money has been approved,"" said Stephen McNair, president of Pioneer's water management group.  Pioneer's goal is to eliminate the use of fresh water in fracking in 5 to 10 years, said McNair.The municipal reclaimed water the company intends to use  comes from sewage plants that treat human waste and water from activities that include bathing and food preparation, according to Texas regulators.City officials say the deal will provide a steady stream of revenue and reduces truck traffic. ""We didn't think we were making our highest and best use of our effluent water, we were using a lot for irrigation,"" said Larry Long, the Odessa city attorney who helped to negotiate the deal with Pioneer. ""We thought it had more value going to the oil companies,"" he said, noting that it would allow potable water currently going to the oil fields to be put to other uses.  EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N), which has wells in the Eagle Ford formation in South Texas, is considering using water from wastewater treatment plants, according to its web site. And Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) uses treated water purchased from the city of Aurora in Colorado, according to a spokesman.  Alpha Reclaim, a private Houston company owned by BNN Energy that supplies reclaimed water to oil companies in Texas, has dealings or contracts with about 30 cities in Texas, including Big Lake in the western part of the state. The firm is looking to grow its water business, including its use of reclaimed wastewater.""We see a lot of opportunity,"" said Mark Ritchie, a vice president at Alpha Reclaim.

122,"  MILAN Dec 3 Italy's Eni has agreed with Anadarko Petroleum to start development of adjoining Mozambique offshore gas fields as the East African country strives to become a key global supplier of liquefied natural gas (LNG).An Eni statement on Thursday said that the two companies would develop straddling reservoirs in the gas-rich Rovuma Basin off the northern coast of Mozambique ""in a separate but coordinated way"" until 24 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas is developed.Further development would be in the hands of a joint venture that would be equally owned by the two groups, it added.Mozambique, one of the world's poorest countries, is hoping to fuel future prosperity with revenue from an estimated 180 trillion cubic feet of offshore gas -- enough to supply Germany, Britain, France and Italy for nearly two decades. The operating agreement, which is subject to final government approval, involves Eni's Mamba field in the Rovuma Basin's Area 4 and Anadarko's Prosperidade acreage in Area 1.Area 4, Eni's biggest ever discovery, holds 85 tcf of gas and is 50 percent owned by the Italian major. Area 1 has reserves of more than 75 tcf and is operated by Anadarko with a 26.5 percent equity stake.Both Eni and Anadarko still have to make final investment decisions on the projects, which will include development of large LNG facilities to export gas mainly to Asian markets. Oil and gas companies worldwide have been delaying big development projects after a sharp fall in oil prices, while the price of LNG in Asian markets is tied to the value of crude.There was speculation earlier this year that Anadarko might sell assets in Mozambique while Eni is actively looking to reduce its stake in Area 4.(Reporting by Stephen Jewkes; Editing by David Goodman)",2015-12-03,APC,"Thu Dec 3, 2015 | 2:22pm EST",Eni and Anadarko join forces on Mozambique gas projects,http://www.reuters.com//article/mozambique-eni-anadarko-petrol-idUSL8N13S56U20151203?type=companyNews

124,"  (Adds details, background)Dec 17 U.S. oil and natural gas company Anadarko Petroleum Corp raised the midpoint of forecast for oil sales volume and expects lower spending during the current quarter and next year as well.The Houston, Texas-based company raised the midpoint of fourth-quarter oil sales-volume forecast by more than 15,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) to a range of 314,000 to 319,000 bopd. Production increases relative to guidance, for the fourth quarter, are driven by the core oil-producing areas in the Wattenberg field and the Delaware Basin, the company said on Thursday.Oil producers, including Anadarko, are trying to lower costs by increasing drilling efficiencies and productivity to cope with a steep decline in oil prices. Anadarko said it now expects capital spending in the fourth quarter to be at or below the midpoint of its previously estimated range of $1.23 billion to $1.43 billion. It also expects 2016 capital spending to be ""significantly lower.""Anadarko on Thursday extended the maturity of its $3 billion unsecured revolving credit facility to January 2021 to improve liquidity.

153,"   By Mike Stone and Devika  Krishna Kumar | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Acquisition-hungry energy companies are back on the prowl.Dealmakers have recovered from the shock of Britain's ""Brexit"" vote last month to leave the European Union and have resumed buying oil and gas fields in choice locations in Canada and the United States, restocking their inventories on a bet that a two-year slump in the price of oil has abated.""Buyers are increasingly confident in a stable to slowly increasing oil price - as are their funding sources, whether private equity funds or public market investors,"" said Bobby Tudor, chief executive of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, an oil and gas investment bank.Oil prices CLc1 have held steady at or above $45 a barrel for a majority of the last two months and touched a 2016 high above $51, ahead of the British referendum.Tudor said buyers were banking on it eventually settling at around $60 a barrel, giving them confidence about buying drilling acreage in some of the nation's shale heartlands.U.S. oil and gas producer Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG.O) last week said it would spend $560 million buying leases on oil-rich land in the Southern Delaware Basin, within the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oilfield, where initial production results have been strong and costs are coming down.A day later, U.S. energy company Laredo Petroleum Inc (LPI.N) said it would spend $125 million buying acreage in the Midland Basin, also part of the Permian.These deals mark a resumption in buying after Brexit caused a temporary lull in acquisitions.Before the British referendum on June 23, buyers and sellers had grown comfortable with the idea that oil had rebounded from 12-year lows. That conviction helped to unclog the acquisition pipeline after a long-dormant period in which deals were offered but failed to materialize.About $5.1 billion of U.S. and Canadian properties traded hands in June, the largest dollar amount in more than a year according to PLS Inc, global M&A database for such deals.Acreage deals create confidence and open the door to acquisitions of entire companies, so long as oil remains relatively steady, according to nearly a dozen dealmakers interviewed by Reuters.More acreage deals are in the works, including ones that involve large exploration and production (E&P) companies such as Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) and Southwestern Energy Co  (SWN.N), according to people familiar with the matter. Restructuring bankers and attorneys anticipate that exploration and production companies that have emerged from bankruptcy, like Magnum Hunter Resources, or are going through the process, like Ultra Petroleum Corp [UPLMQ.PK], will be merger and acquisition targets for other oil and gas companies because they are financially healthy, having eliminated much of their debt.Magnum Hunter and Ultra Petroleum did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Publicly traded companies are warming up to deals now, a change from when deals were mainly stagnant or acreage was sold to private equity firms in small transactions. Traditional E&P companies dominated acquisition activity in the second quarter, representing 69 percent and 76 percent of total transactions and deal value, respectively, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Thursday.PRICE AND PRIME LOCATIONS The key dynamic that has developed and allowed buyers and sellers to get back to cutting deals is price.  Greater stability around the price of oil has enabled both sides to negotiate, where previously expectations of further falls kept them apart.Leading into the spate of deals in June was a nine-week period of relatively low oil volatility, when prices rose about 20 percent and traded between about $40 and $50 a barrel.  Transactions in June occurred at prices about 10 percent higher than the far forward crude price for three years out CLc36, according to bankers. That implies that buyers and sellers could agree upon a price of about $60 per barrel, the bankers said.That forward price has now returned to its pre-Brexit levels of about $54 a barrel, enabling deals once again.Another key ingredient for completed deals was their location. Many of the sales occurred in areas with the highest margins where pumping at about $50 per barrel is profitable. The acreage most sought-after is in Texas' Permian Basin and in Oklahoma's STACK area (Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties), popular because of their easy-to-extract rock formations and relatively low break-even prices.     In June, Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) said it would spend about $888 million to acquire STACK acreage and Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) said it would sell Texas acreage to Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N) and an undisclosed buyer for $858 million.HOPING FOR HIGHER OIL PRICES     While there could be hurdles such as resurgent output and deceleration in demand growth over the next few months, many producers are more bullish on the prices of oil long-term.""Investors have become overly bearish on oil as concerns over rising U.S. rig activity and high fuel inventories raised doubts about the rebalancing of the market. We think those concerns are unwarranted,"" ANZ said in a note.""We think any further decline in prices will accelerate the supply closures again and set the stage for an even stronger price recovery in 2017.""On Friday, U.S. oil prices ended the week 1 percent higher.

In May, Freeport withdrew plans to launch an initial public offering for that business.Anadarko said it would offer 35.3 million shares to fund the deal.

""It was probably a combination of stronger oil prices and  better operational results that ultimately led to a transaction that was frankly better than expected,"" Sussman said.The deal, which is effective Aug. 1 and is expected to close in the fourth quarter, will help Anadarko add about 80,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. Anadarko said it expected to increase its 2016 full-year capital guidance, not including the acquisition, to a range of $2.8 to $3.0 billion, primarily reflecting the increased activity in the Delaware and DJ basins.Anadarko plans to add two rigs in the U.S. Gulf by the end of the year, with more in 2017.

Anadarko said it expected to increase its 2016 full-year capital guidance, not including the acquisition, to a range of $2.8 to $3.0 billion, primarily reflecting the increased activity in the Delaware and DJ basins.Anadarko plans to add two rigs in the U.S. Gulf by the end of the year, with more in 2017. Within five years, Anadarko said it expects its U.S. Gulf production to more than double to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

173,"  Activist investor Carl Icahn, the third-largest shareholder in Freeport McMoran Inc (FCX.N), said on Tuesday he endorsed the U.S. miner's efforts to reduce debt and explore strategic alternatives.Icahn's comments come a day after Freeport said it would sell its deepwater Gulf of Mexico oil and natural gas assets to Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) for $2 billion in a bid to reduce its debt.The billionaire investor, who owns a 7.8 percent stake in Freeport and has two representatives on the board, said last year the company was undervalued and needed to address several corporate governance and capital issues.""Yesterday's announcement demonstrates the Company is making good on its stated goal of deleveraging and is on track to cut its net debt by half, from year end 2015 through the end of next year, at current copper prices,"" Icahn said in a statement on Tuesday. (bit.ly/2cUlDOa)Freeport, like other miners, has been hit hard in recent years by a downturn in prices for commodities, including copper, gold and oil, even as it racked up debt due to acquisitions. The sale to Anadarko follows failed attempts by Freeport to sell all or part of its oil and gas business. In May, Freeport withdrew plans to launch an initial public offering for the business.Chief Executive Richard Adkerson said in July that Freeport was still open to considering ""all strategic moves"" including selling assets or the entire company. However, the company had then put its asset sales plan on the rear burner, and instead unveiled a $1.5 billion share issue to help cut debt.Anderson also said he was confident the company could reduce its $18.8 billion of net debt to between $13.2 billion and $10.5 billion by the end of 2017. The company's share price has more than doubled since it touched a 16-year low in January.
