0,"   By Andrea Shalal-Esa | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Justice Department is investigating export and import procedures at Honeywell International Inc after the firm included Chinese parts in equipment it built for the F-35 fighter jet, three sources familiar with the matter said.Reuters last week reported that the Pentagon twice waived laws banning Chinese-built components in U.S. weapons in 2012 and 2013 for parts supplied by Honeywell for the $392 billion Lockheed Martin Corp F-35 program.New details have now emerged about one of those waivers, which involved simple thermal sensors that Honeywell initially produced in Scotland before moving that production line to China in 2009 and 2010. The other waivers involved high-performance magnets built in China and elsewhere.Federal agents from the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, a law enforcement arm of the Pentagon, are working with prosecutors on the case, a person briefed on the matter said. The DCIS and the Pentagon declined to comment.The precise nature of the investigation could not be confirmed. Typically, however, DCIS export investigations focus on whether a company violated the Arms Control Export Act by sending overseas products or technical specifications for items on the U.S. Munitions List without first obtaining a U.S. government license. The sensors and F-35 specifications in this case may be subject to the U.S. Munitions List. In terms of import violations, DCIS often investigates whether companies have engaged in fraud by misleading the Pentagon as to the origin of foreign parts.The case throws a spotlight on the reliance of American companies, even in sensitive areas, on China as a manufacturing base for basic components. In the past 20 years, much production has been shifted out of the United States to lower cost areas, particularly China.The sensors are part of the power thermal management system that Honeywell builds to cool the F-35, start its engines and pressurize the cabin, said Joe DellaVedova, spokesman for the Pentagon's F-35 program office.Honeywell spokesman Scott Sayres said the company decided in late 2012 - after consulting with Lockheed and the Pentagon - to move production of the sensors used on the F-35 from China to a plant in Boyne City, Michigan. It funded the move at its own cost, he said.Honeywell made the move after the origin of the sensors was discovered during a comprehensive review of the supply chain for the F-35, the newest U.S. warplane. That was carried out by Lockheed after another key supplier, Northrop Grumman Corp, discovered it had used non-compliant magnets made in Japan in building the jet's advanced radar system.Pentagon acquisition chief Frank Kendall also issued a waiver for those parts.Sayres said the sensors were part of a basic circuit card used in products sold commercially around the world.""We firmly believe Honeywell has complied with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations relating to the manufacture of the component in China,"" Sayres said.LOW RISK  Officials at the Justice Department and Pentagon declined to comment on the reported Honeywell investigation.One of the three sources familiar with the probe, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said it was focused on Honeywell's processes and procedures, rather than the components involved.They were seen as low risk items that did not pose any security risk for the F-35 program.The sources also cautioned such investigations can take months or years to complete, and said no determinations had yet been made about Honeywell's actions. Honeywell's Sayres declined to comment on the Justice Department probe, telling Reuters: ""As a general practice, we do not comment on the existence or nature of any active government investigations.""Honeywell decided to move the sensor production to China to save money, and simplify its supply line, he said.The Government Accountability Office (GAO), the investigative arm of Congress, is also looking into the sensor issue and two others involving the F-35, as part of a report due March 1.U.S. lawmakers ordered the GAO report because they are concerned American firms are being shut out of the specialty metals market, and that U.S. weapons could become dependent on parts made by a potential future adversary.Pentagon spokeswoman Maureen Schumann said the Pentagon's Kendall had granted national security waivers to allow foreign-built parts on other aircraft in the past, but had no immediate details about those cases.DellaVedova, the spokesman for the F-35 program office, said the thermal sensors were simple parts that did not include any software and were not programmable. He said there was no security risk associated with use of the sensors.He said all the Chinese-built sensors would eventually be replaced on the F-35s, but the process had not yet been completed. He had no immediate information on how many Chinese-built sensors were installed on the planes.""This will all be taken care of,"" DellaVedova said.(Additional reporting by John Shiffman; Editing by Martin Howell, Sophie Hares and Grant McCool)",2014-01-12,HON,"Sun Jan 12, 2014 | 8:12am EST","Exclusive: U.S. investigating Honeywell over export, import controls",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-honeywell-china-investigation-idUSBREA0B08C20140112?type=companyNews

11,"   By Ernest Scheyder  Diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by strong sales of turbochargers to help automobiles meet fuel-efficiency standards.The company, which also makes airplane cockpit parts, chemicals for the energy industry and scores of other electronics and equipment, said it is ""cautiously optimistic"" on the health of the global economy and that it still expects profit to rise at least 9 percent this year.""We are in a better spot than we were in a year ago in terms of growth,"" Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek said in an interview. ""But I don't think we're experiencing any kind of meaningful positive trends.""One of the company's brightest spots during the quarter was its Transportation Systems unit, which saw profit jump 39 percent, helped largely by demand for turbochargers, devices that boost an engine's torque.New fuel-efficiency regulations across Europe, China and the United States have boosted demand for Honeywell's turbochargers, as Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and other major automakers aim to get more power out of engines with less fuel.""You're seeing more legislation and regulation, and also more demand for efficiency,"" Szlosek said. ""That bodes well for our turbo business.""While the unit is Honeywell's smallest, executives see it as one of the fastest-growing. Indeed, in a revised forecast announced on Thursday, Honeywell cut its 2014 margin outlook for its three other units, but raised the margin outlook for the Transportation Systems unit. The company's Performance Materials and Technologies unit, which makes chemicals used in the oil and other sectors, has a 3 percent drop in profit during the quarter as some products came off patent.Despite the dip, Szlosek expressed confidence that the unit's profit should trend higher as new products launch this year.The company posted first-quarter net income of $1.02 billion, or $1.28 per share, compared with $966 million, or $1.23 per share, in the year-ago quarter. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales rose 4 percent to $9.68 billion, missing the $9.74 billion estimate from Wall Street.Honeywell last month set a target to boost annual sales to more than $50 billion by 2018 and to spend $10 billion on acquisitions. Honeywell posted $39.1 billion in sales last year.The New Jersey-based company expects high-growth regions such as China to drive about half its sales growth over the next five years, with profit margins for its business segments increasing to between 18.5 percent to 20 percent over that time, up from 16.5 percent for the first quarter. The $10 billion in acquisitions targeted by the company is more than twice as much as Honeywell spent on deals in the previous five years. Honeywell and other industrial conglomerates are eager to bolster their operations through deals but may hesitate due to high valuations of targets.Also on Thursday, Honeywell lifted the bottom end of its 2014 earnings forecast.

""But I don't think we're experiencing any kind of meaningful positive trends.""One of the company's brightest spots during the quarter was its Transportation Systems unit, which saw profit jump 39 percent, helped largely by demand for turbochargers, devices that boost an engine's torque.New fuel-efficiency regulations across Europe, China and the United States have boosted demand for Honeywell's turbochargers, as Volkswagen and other major automakers aim to get more power out of engines with less fuel.""You're seeing more legislation and regulation, and also more demand for efficiency,"" Szlosek said. ""That bodes well for our turbo business."" While the unit is Honeywell's smallest, executives see it as one of the fastest-growing. Indeed, in a revised forecast announced on Thursday, Honeywell cut its 2014 margin outlook for its three other units, but raised the margin outlook for the Transportation Systems unit.The company's Performance Materials and Technologies unit, which makes chemicals used in the oil and other sectors, has a 3 percent drop in profit during the quarter as some products came off patent.Despite the dip, Szlosek expressed confidence that the unit's profit should trend higher as new products launch  this year.The company posted first-quarter net income of $1.02 billion, or $1.28 per share, compared with $966 million, or $1.23 per share, in the year-ago quarter. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales rose 4 percent to $9.68 billion, missing the $9.74 billion estimate from Wall Street.Honeywell last month set a target to boost annual sales to more than $50 billion by 2018 and to spend $10 billion on acquisitions. Honeywell posted $39.1 billion in sales last year. The New Jersey-based company expects high-growth regions such as China to drive about half its sales growth over the next five years, with profit margins for its business segments increasing to between 18.5 percent to 20 percent over that time, up from 16.5 percent for the first quarter.The $10 billion in acquisitions targeted by the company is more than twice as much as Honeywell spent on deals in the previous five years. Honeywell and other industrial conglomerates are eager to bolster their operations through deals but may hesitate due to high valuations of targets.Also on Thursday, Honeywell lifted the bottom end of its 2014 earnings forecast. The company now expects to earn $5.40 to $5.55 per share this year, where previously the bottom end of that range had been $5.35 per share.Wall Street expects the company to earn $5.54 per share this year.Honeywell this month elevated two executives to the newly created position of vice chairman, with each of them taking responsibility for aspects of the five-year financial plan.Shares of Honeywell rose slightly to $93.33 in midday trading.

It will use an AT&T 4G LTE network and Honeywell systems and hardware to supply broadband service to business, commercial and general aviation passengers, as well as to airlines seeking more connectivity onboard planes.Honeywell said the deal could provide it with $1 billion in revenue over the next decade. AT&T declined to estimate potential revenue from the agreement.The two companies have signed a letter of intent and expect to sign a formal contract shortly, Honeywell said. Gogo Inc currently provides similar cellular network-based technology, known as air-to-ground, that is in use on about 80 percent of wired commercial aircraft in the United States, including Delta Air Lines and the newly merged American Airlines.After Gogo shares fell sharply, Chief Executive Mike Small said in an interview: ""I think it went the wrong direction."" He noted that Gogo pioneered the air-to-ground system over the last 20 years.""We have a great business and everybody wants in,"" he said. GoGo recently announced a satellite-based system that offers connectivity over water and uses a dual antenna capable of providing speeds of up to 70 megabits per second, compared with its current air-to-ground service speed of 9.8 mbps in the U.S.Honeywell said the AT&T system would have greater speed and bandwidth than existing systems, but did not provide approximate data speeds for the 4G system. AT&T said the airborne WiFi fits its strategy of adding connectivity to a wide range of applications, from cars to automation in homes. The company has about 116 million subscribers in the United States.The AT&T-Honeywell deal comes as a number of in-flight internet options are being rolled out, many based on Ka band or Ku band satellite spectrum. The systems promise faster speeds and wider application, at lower cost. But they also have made it difficult for airlines to choose among competing technologies, and the cost of equipping a fleet can cost hundreds of millions of dollars.Better connectivity would allow more communication with pilots and crew members and the plane's diagnostic systems, providing real-time weather tracking, and status reports on aircraft parts. With improved and less costly connectivity, a plane could send more alerts about parts that might be close to failure, enabling ground crews to have spares ready when the aircraft lands.Greater connectivity also would help in tracking jets, That is a priority as the search continues for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, which vanished from radar screens on March 8 with 239 people aboard.

29,"  * Market seen swelling to $2.1 bln by 2023 -Euroconsult* Good for suppliers like Cobham, Thales - analysts* Not all airlines agree wireless is best choice* U.S. players include Gogo, Honeywell, Golden EagleBy Lionel LaurentLONDON, July 22 The web-connected aircraft cabins of the future, powered by technology on show at last week's Farnborough Airshow, are offering a path to investor returns through suppliers like Cobham Plc and Thales SA .The market for inflight wireless internet, entertainment and communications services, driven by a flying public who increasingly want to chat, tweet, stream movies and check Facebook uninterrupted, is set to grow to $2.1 billion by 2023 from $440 million in 2013, consultancy Euroconsult says.While the past is dotted with inflight internet schemes which failed to take off, such as Boeing Co's Connexion, there are more reasons to be bullish as installation costs have come down and the use of social media has skyrocketed.""It's gone from the days when you were completely cut off in an aeroplane, to where very shortly every carrier will be offering real-time television,"" said Nick Cunningham, an analyst with Agency Partners.""You're talking about an installed base of literally tens of thousands of aircraft, starting with wide-bodies and working your way down ... It's going to be a must-have."" Analysts say this is good for parts makers such as UK-based Cobham, which makes compact, lightweight satellite-communication systems for both small and large planes. Cobham, named after its aviator founder who pioneered mid-air refueling in the 1930s and 40s, showed off its antenna technology at Farnborough.Other key players include France's Thales, Europe's largest defence electronics firm and one of the leading providers of in-flight entertainment and streaming systems, competing with the Avionics arm of Japan's Panasonic Corp.Thales bought LiveTV - a provider of in-flight entertainment and broadband services - from JetBlue Airways Corp  earlier this year. Florida-based LiveTV has more than 500 employees and expects 2014 revenue of over $150 million.Such investments underscore the reasons for investors to be optimistic on take-up of the technology in the still-booming commercial aviation market: installation costs are falling, systems are becoming lighter and satellite coverage is becoming available to most areas where air traffic is dense, according to Euroconsult.The downsides? There is no consensus yet on how to charge for such services, onboard satellite communications equipment is still costly and the certification process is relatively long. HIGH STAKES Not all airlines agree wireless technology is the right service to offer passengers. Its main competitor comes from the in-flight entertainment industry, whose movie and game systems are hard-wired into aircraft seatbacks.At a global travel fair in March, Lufthansa  announced plans to wirelessly stream movies on long flights, but Qatar Airways called the technology untested and said it would stick to traditional seatback screens. The stakes are high for airlines because in-flight entertainment is increasingly seen as a lucrative shopping platform as well as a place to watch games and films.Meanwhile, broader aviation trends are strong, with Boeing and Airbus Group NV betting the world will need some 30,000 to 36,000 new aircraft over the next 20 years.It is tough to pick out cheap aerospace stocks as a result, with the STOXX Europe 600 aerospace and defence index  up some 95 percent from 2011 lows, compared with a rise of about 50 percent for the broad Euro STOXX 50 index.Thales - about 30 percent of whose sales come from civil aerospace including cockpit systems - trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.98, while Cobham, which gets 19 percent of its revenue from the commercial aeronautics sector, is trading at 13.87, according to Thomson Reuters data.Both are lower than the median multiple of 14.07 for a basket of eight aerospace stocks, including Airbus, Safran SA  and Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc.Other U.S.-listed stocks in the field include Gogo Inc  , a supplier of broadband services, Honeywell International Inc, network operator AT&T Inc, manufacturer General Dynamics Corp and Global Eagle Entertainment Inc.Giving an indication of the rates of growth on offer, London-listed satellite operator Inmarsat Plc - market leader in aviation - said last year its compound annual revenue growth rate for all aviation services had jumped 22 percent between 2005 and 2013, more than other divisions.""Thales are saying it's quite a good fit to provide interconnection and Cobham are well-positioned because they do all the antennae and the other hardware that connects,"" said Zafar Khan, analyst at Societe Generale.""I'm not sure how huge a money spinner it will be in the grand scheme of things, but it is an interesting area.""

30,"   By Lewis Krauskopf  Aug 25 A lockout of about 135 union employees at a Honeywell International Inc uranium conversion plant in Illinois is poised to extend past a month as the two sides remain apart on several issues.Production and maintenance employees at the Metropolis, Illinois, plant who are members of United Steelworkers Local 7-669 have been locked out since the start of August, after a three-year contract expired. Talks are not expected to resume this week while the company reviews the union's latest proposal, said union spokesman John Paul Smith.""When it comes down to it, we are no closer to an agreement than we were on Aug. 1,"" Smith said.Honeywell said it is committed to bargaining in good faith, but is also concerned about the plant's long-term competitiveness.The plant accrued $300 million in operating losses over the past 10 years and is ""just now starting to break even,"" a company spokesman said. The diverse manufacturer, whose products also include climate control systems and aviation components, posted $39.1 billion in revenue last year. ""The company believes that with the right investments and the right labor contract, the plant will become and remain profitable,"" spokesman Peter Dalpe said in an emailed statement.Honeywell's Metropolis plant is the only U.S. facility that converts uranium oxide into to uranium hexafluoride, which is then enriched to be used as fuel in nuclear power plants. Honeywell has continued to operate the plant after the lockout, with the remaining roughly 135 plant employees who are non-union, as well as with contingent workers.The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has taken more precautions since the lockout began, including continuously staffing the plant during the first 72 hours and increasing safety inspections to once a week from the typical schedule of about once a month.No ""significant issues"" have been found, but the NRC will continue the stepped-up inspection schedule until the work stoppage is resolved or the agency is satisfied the plant can operate long-term without any issues, said NRC spokesman Roger Hannah. ""We're satisfied they have the appropriate training, but we want to make sure those people can perform those functions for an extended period of time without any issues,"" Hannah said.Honeywell also locked out workers for 14 months between 2010 and 2011 during a contract dispute. Since then, the number of union workers has dropped from 228 to its current level.The two sides remain apart on use of subcontractors, pay, healthcare benefits and work rules including grievance procedures, Smith said.Honeywell also closed the plant for a year starting in mid-2012 to make more than $40 million worth of safety upgrades required by the NRC in the wake of the disaster at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant. Some employees were let go during that time, but Honeywell spokesman Dalpe said the investment preserved jobs ""that would have been lost otherwise.""

33,"  NEW DELHI Tata Power Co Ltd's (TTPW.NS) defense engineering unit, Tata Power SED, has signed an agreement with Honeywell International (HON.N) to produce the U.S. company's ""TALIN"" navigator in India, Honeywell said in a statement on Monday.Honeywell will license the design and hardware to assemble, test and eventually build the production kits for the navigation system in India, in a boost for New Delhi's efforts to encourage local manufacturing of defense equipment. The agreement, announced during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States, will mark the first time India has produced inertial land navigation technology, Honeywell said.The world's largest arms importer, India is keen to modernize its armed forces by promoting domestic industry.  In a bid to kick start local production and encourage foreign manufacturers to share technology, the new government has approved a plan to raise the amount of foreign direct investment allowed in its defense industry to 49 percent from 26 percent.

34,"  NEW DELHI, Sept 29 Tata Power Co Ltd's  defence engineering unit, Tata Power SED, has signed an agreement with Honeywell International to produce the U.S. company's ""TALIN"" navigator in India, Honeywell said in a statement on Monday.Honeywell will license the design and hardware to assemble, test and eventually build the production kits for the navigation system in India, in a boost for New Delhi's efforts to encourage local manufacturing of defence equipment.The agreement, announced during Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States, will mark the first time India has produced inertial land navigation technology, Honeywell said. The world's largest arms importer, India is keen to modernise its armed forces by promoting domestic industry. In a bid to kick start local production and encourage foreign manufacturers to share technology, the new government has approved a plan to raise the amount of foreign direct investment allowed in its defence industry to 49 percent from 26 percent.

Independent tests conducted by the agency and Boeing both showed blanking on the screens when Wi-Fi devices were used near them. The displays are also susceptible to transmissions from mobile phones, weather radar and mobile satellite communications, the FAA said.Honeywell spokesman Steve Brecken said no display units had blanked in-flight due to Wi-Fi interference. ""The only know occurrence was during a developmental test conducted on the ground. We worked with Boeing and addressed any concerns in 2012 with new display hardware,"" he said. The display units provide crucial flight information including airspeed, altitude and navigation information, and cost thousands of dollars each.

The FAA's directives make them mandatory,"" Boeing spokesman Miles Kotay said.A number of airlines and Honeywell asked the FAA to delay or reduce the effects of the directive, but the regulator said the move was necessary to avoid loss of information during take-offs or landings, which could result in ""loss of airplane control at an altitude insufficient for recovery.""

37,"  * GE, Honeywell climb after quarterly results* Housing shares up after WSJ report, data* Small caps dip; energy shares gain* Indexes up: Dow 1.6 pct, S&P 1.3 pct, Nasdaq 1 pct   (Updates to close)By Caroline ValetkevitchNEW YORK, Oct 17 U.S. stocks extended their rebound from this month's bruising selloff on Friday, giving the S&P 500 its best day in over a week, as worries about the U.S. earnings outlook eased, but the S&P 500 still posted its fourth straight week of declines.The S&P 500's streak of weekly losses was its longest since August 2011, and the index still is off 6.2 percent from its Sept. 18 record high. The drop follows worries over the health of the global economy, the spread of the Ebola virus, as well as factors including lower oil prices and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's next steps. However, the broad index this week steered clear of correction territory, a 10-percent drop from its high.Friday's earnings offset some of the concerns about the impact of weak global demand on U.S. corporations. Honeywell  shares gained 4.3 percent to $90.06 after results.  General Electric shares rose 2.4 percent to $24.82 on its earnings.The S&P 500 posted its biggest one-day percentage gain since Oct. 8 and some investors said the recent selloff may have run its course.""This should be it. The market should do well once we get by some of these geopolitical risks that are on top of us right now, the Ebola thing and the mid-cycle elections,"" said Michael Mullaney, chief investment officer at Fiduciary Trust Co in Boston, which oversees more than $11.3 billion. ""I would think the market is going to be strong into the close this year.""Small caps closed lower. The Russell 2000 index was down 0.4 percent after a three-day streak of more than 1 percent gains, its best since July 2012. The index gained 2.8 percent for the week.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 263.17 points, or 1.63 percent, to 16,380.41, the S&P 500 gained 24 points, or 1.29 percent, to 1,886.76 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 41.05 points, or 0.97 percent, to 4,258.44. For the week, the Dow and S&P were down 1 percent while the Nasdaq was down 0.4 percent.Housing shares were among the day's best performers after a Wall Street Journal report said Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are close to an agreement that could boost mortgage lending. Shares of D.R. Horton rose 6.2 percent to $21.56, while shares of Toll Brothers gained 2.5 percent to $31.23.Also lifting the sector were increases in U.S. September housing starts and permits.The S&P energy index was up 0.9 percent, helped by shares of Schlumberger, up 3.7 percent to $93.97. The world's largest oilfield services company's third-quarter profit beat estimates.The largest percentage gainer on the S&P 500 was Mead Johnson Nutrition, up 9.9 percent to $100.23, after sources told Reuters that French food giant Danone has decided to pursue a takeover.

Honeywell International's (HON.N) aerospace revenue beat some analysts' forecasts, while the division's profit margins improved.

The demand is cascading down the supply chain to companies like Honeywell and GE that build key components such as avionics and engines. Boeing and Airbus now buy about two-thirds of the planes' content from suppliers rather than building it themselves. ""The data on aerospace remains strong,"" said Scott Lawson, vice president of Westwood Holdings Group.

46,"  (Adds Honeywell and Dupont's comments)By Foo Yun Chee and Barbara LewisBRUSSELS Oct 21 U.S. firm Honeywell International Inc's joint venture with chemicals company DuPont to produce a new refrigerant for car air conditioning systems to meet new environmental rules may be anti-competitive, the European Commission said on Tuesday, following a near-three year probe.The Commission said the agreements between the two companies related to the new coolant, known as R1234yf, may have blocked rivals keen to participate in its development and production.The coolant, which is designed to meet an EU directive aimed at reducing the use of fluorinated greenhouse gases in car air conditioning systems, has pitted EU regulators against Germany and its powerful car makers led by Daimler. Last month the Commission ordered Germany to stop its carmakers using a banned refrigerant with a higher ""global warming potential"" than the Honeywell-Dupont product within two months or face court action and possible fines.The new R1234yf coolant is already used in about 2 million cars globally.When Honeywell and Dupont announced a joint venture to construct and operate a global manufacturing plant for the new refrigerant they said they had developed the product jointly but would market and sell it separately. ""The cooperation they entered into in 2010 ... may have limited its (the R1234yf refrigerant's) availability and technical development, in breach of EU antitrust rules,"" the Commission said in a statement on Tuesday.It sent a so-called statement of objections or charge sheet setting out its concerns to the companies. Honeywell rejected the charges, saying it had complied with EU rules.""The allegations outlined in the statement of objections are baseless and conflict with the EU's own laws that encourage collaboration on development,"" the company said in a statement.DuPont said it was disappointed with the Commission's move  and that it would defend its case vigorously.The firms can ask for a closed-door hearing to argue their case. If found guilty, they could face fines of up to 10 percent of their global turnover.

48,"   By Lewis Krauskopf and Mica Rosenberg  The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has sued Honeywell International Inc to stop the company from imposing penalties on employees who refuse to undergo testing under its corporate wellness program.The lawsuit is the third case since August filed by the federal agency challenging a corporate wellness program, with Honeywell the biggest company to be targeted. Wellness programs that encourage healthier habits have become increasingly popular in Corporate America, as they promise to improve productivity, cut absenteeism and reduce medical costs.Such programs are also encouraged under President Barack Obama's healthcare law, the Affordable Care Act (ACA).Honeywell employees could be penalized up to $4,000 each, through surcharges and lost contributions to health plans, if they or their spouses do not comply with the biometric testing, according to the lawsuit, filed on Monday in U.S. District Court in Minnesota.According to the lawsuit, employees and spouses are screened for blood pressure, cholesterol, blood-sugar levels, waist circumference and nicotine. Honeywell had informed employees that testing was to occur from Oct 22-31, the lawsuit said. The testing program violates the Americans with Disabilities Act and Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, according to the lawsuit. The EEOC enforces federal labor laws having to do with discrimination. The agency asked for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction enjoining Honeywell from seeking to impose the penalties. A hearing is set for Monday, according to court documents.Honeywell employs about 51,000 people in the United States, according to its most recent annual U.S. securities filing. Of Honeywell employees and spouses enrolled in a health plan, 77 percent of participated in the company’s wellness program last year, up from 36 percent in 2011, the company said.

67,"  (Adds comment from Honeywell)By Sharon BegleyNEW YORK, April 16 In what would be a significant and hard-fought victory for U.S. businesses, the Obama administration said on Thursday it will propose new rules for workplace wellness programs that would treat as voluntary even plans that penalize workers thousands of dollars for not participating.That decision, which will be published in the Federal Register on Monday, opening 60 days for public comment, would likely remove the government's legal challenge to the wellness program at Honeywell International Inc.Last year, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) sued Honeywell, arguing that penalties in its workplace wellness program, which can reach $4,000 a year for workers who choose not to participate, made it involuntary.The ""voluntary"" standard is critical because a landmark anti-discrimination law largely prohibits employers from asking questions about the health of workers unless the queries relate to their ability to perform a job.Wellness programs, which the vast majority of large U.S. firms have instituted, often require employees to answer detailed questions about their family medical histories and to undergo employer-specified medical exams, such as for cholesterol and glucose levels, blood pressure, weight and waist size.The programs have expanded since President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law of 2010, which allows employers to charge non-participants 30 percent more for health coverage, including premiums and deductibles. That can amount to thousands of dollars a year.The EEOC therefore had to reconcile that Obamacare provision with the prohibition on involuntary wellness programs, which is part of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Although that landmark law ""limits the circumstances in which employers may ask employees about their health or require them to undergo medical examinations, it allows such inquiries and exams if they are voluntary and part of an employee health program,"" the EEOC said in a statement.The agency added that the ""proposed rule makes clear that wellness programs are permitted under the ADA,"" and that ""companies may offer incentives of up to 30 percent of the total cost of employee-only coverage in connection with wellness programs.""The EEOC proposal would bar employers from firing, disciplining, coercing, or denying health coverage to employees who decline to participate in a wellness program. BUSINESS LOBBYING About 98 percent of U.S. companies with 200 or more workers, and 73 percent of smaller firms, offered wellness programs in 2014, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Those numbers are up from 62 percent of larger firms and 26 percent of smaller firms offering such programs in 2006.Wellness programs are generally managed by outside companies in what has become an $8 billion-a-year industry, research firm IBISWorld reported last month.Reuters reported in November that leading U.S. corporations represented by the Business Roundtable, angered by the EEOC's legal action against Honeywell, were threatening to pull their tacit support for Obamacare unless the government backed off . Since then, the Business Roundtable has made meeting government officials about the issue ""a top priority,"" a senior official for the group said.The Roundtable argues that wellness programs with hefty penalties are voluntary ""because employees can elect to participate or pay the penalty,"" said its outside counsel, Nancy Taylor.The EEOC apparently agreed.""Employers are going to be pretty happy about the proposed regulation,"" said Seth Perretta, a principal at Groom Law Group in Washington and an expert in employment law.In a statement, Honeywell called the EEOC proposal ""a positive step toward enabling the implementation of the President's health care law and the desire of all Americans to lead healthier lives,"" and said no employee has been denied healthcare coverage ""or disciplined in any way as a result of their voluntary decision not to participate in our wellness programs.""Patient advocacy and anti-discrimination groups, however, criticized the idea that a wellness program can be voluntary if opting out brings hefty financial penalties.The EEOC proposal ""appears to diminish the protections that workers have against being coerced to disclose medical information to their employers when that information is unrelated to their ability to do their jobs,"" said attorney Jennifer Mathis of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.If the EEOC proposal takes effect, employees who feel they are being coerced into workplace wellness programs could try to challenge it in court. In general, however, courts defer to federal agencies on such questions.

Among the biggest drags, the S&P financials index  was down 1.3 percent, with shares of Dow component American Express falling 4.4 percent to $77.32 after revenue missed analysts' estimates, partly due to the currency impact.The Dow and S&P 500 both snapped two weeks of gains. For the week, the Dow was down 1.3 percent, the S&P 500 down 1 percent and the Nasdaq down 1.3 percent.Both Honeywell International and General Electric  blamed the strong dollar for lower revenue. Shares of Honeywell were down 2.1 percent at $101.70, while GE shares were down 0.1 percent at $27.25.China's securities regulator warned investors to be cautious as Chinese shares hit seven-year highs. China allowed fund managers to lend stocks for short-selling and expanded the number of stocks investors can short. China H-Share index futures fell 3.4 percent.

70,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | April 17  April 17 General Electric Co and Honeywell International Inc said on Friday they will take steps to cushion the impact of a stronger dollar, which hurt first-quarter results at both companies.Indeed, the impact of currency shifts on U.S. companies will be highlighted further next week with quarterly reports from United Technologies Corp, which already slashed its 2015 financial forecast in January over currency worries, as well as from 3M Co and Illinois Tool Works Inc.GE said foreign currency effects shaved $950 million, or 4 percentage points, off its sales in the first quarter.Honeywell also reported a 4-percentage-point quarterly drag from a stronger dollar, and projected that exchange fluctuations would weigh down sales by $1.7 billion this year. The rise in the dollar - which has surged 22 percent against a basket of major currencies since June 30 - hurts U.S. companies with major foreign sales, because they lose value when translated from weaker currencies into the greenback.Both companies said they have been taking action to mitigate the currency impact. GE is considering different locations where it can manufacture products or components for businesses, such as its power and healthcare units, said Chief Financial Officer Jeff Bornstein.""We certainly have thought more deeply and more thoughtfully about our supply chain footprint and our manufacturing footprint,"" Bornstein said in an interview. ""That's a little bit of a natural hedge that a global company has."" GE shares were down about 1 percent at $27.03 in afternoon trading after posting results. The U.S. conglomerate stood by its full-year industrial profit view despite concerns about its oil and gas business.Honeywell Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek said in an interview that the company has been hedging transactions that its individual foreign subsidiaries make when they import in dollars. Now, he said, it is also hedging when the company's foreign sales are translated back into the dollar. Honeywell's earnings, which the company projected to be in a range of $6 to $6.15 a share this year, would have been 12 or 13 cents a share lower without those hedges, Szlosek said.""Our hedging strategy has protected us significantly from the impact of FX on sales,"" Szlosek said.Honeywell shares were off 2 percent at $101.79 after the company lowered its full-year revenue forecast.""We're going to see a lot of dollar impact across the board,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer with Solaris Asset Management.

The European Commission last year launched legal proceedings against Germany, which has backed Daimler's refusal to use the R1234yf coolant developed by U.S. conglomerate Honeywell  in partnership with Dupont.Daimler, which has said the coolant can cause fire in front-end collisions, said on Tuesday it will install a ""specific protective system"" in vehicles switching to R1234yf to ensure safety. The world's third-largest maker of luxury cars has insisted on using R134a, a global warming agent that is more than 1,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide, but does not burst into flames. EU rules will require carmakers from 2017 to use coolants with a global warming potential no more than 150 times that of carbon dioxide.The Stuttgart-based manufacturer also said it will phase in carbon dioxide (CO2) as a refrigerant in S-Class and E-Class models starting next year. The two-track approach is required as it is not feasible to roll out CO2-based air conditioning technology across the fleet by January 2017, Daimler said.The Commission was not immediately available for comment.

Monday's stock gains were broad, with all 10 major S&P sectors higher, but investors shell-shocked by this year's market turbulence remained wary.""I don't think we're through the mess,"" said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager at Swarthmore Group in Philadelphia. ""You still have concerns about China and where growth goes there, and that's why you're still going to have this volatility.""U.S. crude prices settled up more than 6 percent, while prices of industrial metals such as copper and zinc rose as investors worried about potential shortages. At 2:33 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.37 percent at 16,616.04 points and the S&P 500 had gained 1.28 percent to 1,942.33.

119,"  Aerospace component supplier Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) confirmed on Tuesday that it had engaged in deal talks with United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) over the past year, and said it did not see regulatory process as a ""material obstacle"" to the deal.The announcement comes a day after United Tech disclosed merger talks with Honeywell and said a deal would ""face insurmountable regulatory obstacles"".United Tech, which makes Pratt & Whitney jet engines and Otis elevators, said on Monday that a merger could either be blocked outright or conditioned on significant divestitures after a lengthy and disruptive review period that would destroy shareholder value. ""A combined Honeywell and United Technologies would maintain a strong investment grade rating, and have higher free cash flow,"" Honeywell said.A merger of the two firms would create a behemoth with combined sales of more than $90 billion, a company responsible for a huge amount of equipment on commercial airliners, ranging from jet engines to airplane cockpits and landing gear.

124,"   By Cyril Altmeyer and Tim Hepher | PARIS  PARIS France's Thales (TCFP.PA) ruled out its participation in a ""Big Bang"" merger as the aerospace industry digested news of inconclusive talks between two of its largest suppliers, United Technologies (UTX.N) and Honeywell (HON.N).The existence of recent talks between the U.S. groups to create a components and engines giant with $90 billion of sales became public overnight, but United Technologies said a deal would ""face insurmountable regulatory obstacles.""The shape of the potential tie-up echoed, on a larger scale, abortive talks between Thales and French aero engines maker Safran (SAF.PA) in 2007. They broadly compete with Honeywell and United Technologies respectively.But Thales Chief Executive Patrice Caine told reporters he had no intention of revisiting the discussions and highlighted the difficulties of carrying out ""Big Bang"" transactions.He also ruled out bidding for Safran's Morpho Detection airport security business, which is reportedly up for sale. Thales would focus on add-on acquisitions without major execution risk and with a high chance of boosting profitability.Thales makes civil and military aircraft avionics, satellites, rail signalling systems and radar.Shares in Europe's largest defence electronics group rose more than 6 percent as strong 2015 defence earnings helped lift operating profit 23 percent to 1.22 billion euros ($1.3 billion), and advance payments from orders more than doubled its cashflow.     Thales raised its dividend 21 percent to 1.36 euros after posting higher-than-expected core profit and record orders for 2015, kicking into a higher gear after years of lacklustre growth.The company's order intake jumped 31 percent to 18.88 billion euros, lifted by radar contracts for recent French Rafale fighter sales to Egypt and Qatar, as well as a major London Underground signalling contract.Caine dismissed talk of a downturn in civil aerospace markets, saying airline traffic continued to support rising aircraft production.  He said a UK vote to leave the European Union in a June referendum would be neutral for the company's UK defence business but would ""raise concerns about the dynamism of Europe"".For 2016, Thales predicted operating income of between 1.3 billion euros and 1.33 billion, on the high side of analyst forecasts, and mid-single digit organic sales growth. It also said it planned to erase losses at its transport division.($1 = 0.9098 euros) (Editing by James Regan and David Holmes)",2016-02-23,HON,"Tue Feb 23, 2016 | 7:01am EST",Thales shuns big mergers after U.S. aero firms try to team up,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-thales-results-idUSKCN0VW0DP?type=companyNews

131,"   By Andrea Shalal and Michael Flaherty  Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) Chief Executive David Cote was sporting the casual jeans and sweater he often likes to wear in the office when he was visited by his then-counterpart at United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) in 2012, Louis Chenevert.With Honeywell's stock trading at around $55, Chenevert had come to discuss offering $65 per share to merge the two U.S. aerospace and automation giants.The idea was not new. The two companies had flirted with it for years, even before General Electric Co's (GE.N) failed bid to acquire Honeywell in 2000. But the talks never advanced beyond initial approaches.That time was no different. Cote responded negatively, telling Chenevert he believed Honeywell's stock would be worth $100 in a few years. He was proven right.While Honeywell's stock has risen more than 80 percent since then, and is near all-time highs, UTC's stock has risen only by a third, and is down a third from its 2015 peak.Cote, 63, sensed an opportunity to turn the tables by unveiling a $90.7 billion bid this week. Even after running Honeywell for 14 years, Cote's appetite for the top job is undiminished. He proposed a deal in which Honeywell would be the buyer and lead the merger, with Cote holding both CEO and chairman titles of the combined company.  This account, based on two sources briefed on the meeting and public filings, shows why Honeywell, which had previously shied away from a deal, was happy to confirm its interest in UTC this week from a position of strength. It also illustrates the challenges UTC now faces in resisting a deal.""It is very opportunistic of Dave. I don't blame him, but it's not going to happen,"" Greg Hayes, UTC's CEO since 2014, said on CNBC this week.UTC argues that a merger with Honeywell would face insurmountable antitrust obstacles and strong customer opposition, citing concerns expressed by Airbus Group SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N). Honeywell says antitrust issues are limited and can be addressed through asset sales. Honeywell has also argued that the combined company, which would have a market capitalization of more than $160 billion, would be able to offer a more comprehensive suite of products and services to customers, with the annualized cost synergies reaching $3.5 billion. UTC disputes that figure, and points out that the asset sales required to receive antitrust approval and customer concessions would destroy a lot of value.""If Honeywell wants to buy at a full and fair price, then yes, I would want to sell,"" said Daniel O'Keefe, portfolio manager at mutual fund manager Artisan Partners, which owns a $212 million stake in United Technologies.INVESTOR DAYS     Honeywell, which has a scheduled investor day on March 2,  has no plans to go hostile with its bid, according to the sources. However, UTC's stock has been rising every day since Honeywell's approach was disclosed on Tuesday, and is now up 10 percent since then, as investors bet on a deal happening. As a result, UTC will have to present a compelling standalone plan at its annual investor day on March 10 to keep its shareholders on board. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company has already been going out of its way to maintain investor support.UTC removed Chenevert in late 2014 after he refused to consider a sale of storied helicopter maker Sikorsky, according to the sources. Chenevert, who now works at Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), did not respond to requests for comment.Chenevert was succeeded by Hayes, whose first act was to announce a strategic review of all options. He reached out to Honeywell again in April 2015 to explore a merger, but cooled on the idea after he saw the antitrust environment become more stringent and UTC's stock lost value on disappointing earnings.UTC later sold Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) for $9 billion and agreed to use the proceeds to fund additional share repurchases.   BREAKING UP At a time when peers such as General Electric Co (GE.N) have been slimming down to focus on core businesses, UTC has retained its diversity. It makes everything from air conditioners to elevators and fire equipment, to a broad range of aerospace equipment, including tires, cockpits and engines.But UTC's businesses are not all faring equally. Its underperforming Otis elevator division, for example, is facing steep engineering and development costs as the company tries to refresh its product line.In light of UTC's latest snub of Honeywell, it will also have to explain why separating its aerospace from its buildings divisions does not make sense. Hayes has no intention of breaking up the company, according to a source familiar with his thinking.

137,"   By Alwyn Scott and Andrea Shalal | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Honeywell International Inc's (HON.N) proposal to buy rival United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) would create an industrial giant bigger than aircraft makers Boeing Co (BA.N) or Airbus Group (AIR.PA), potentially changing the balance of power between manufacturer and supplier.Pricing power is a key concern of the big aircraft makers, and it is a central issue in the battle between United Technologies and Honeywell. United Technologies on Friday rejected Honeywell's $90.7 billion offer, citing customer concerns among other big issues.With nearly $100 billion in annual sales and significant combined market share for such key aircraft components as wheels, brakes, power units, ventilation systems, electronics and small engines, a combined Honeywell/United Technologies would have the heft to fight price-cutting demands from customers, industry experts said. Boeing and Airbus have encouraged small and mid-sized suppliers to merge, so they would have more financial and management depth to serve the plane makers as they ramp up production over the next several years. That growth requires investments in machines and people that small companies may not be able to support.At the same time, however, the two aircraft makers have pushed suppliers for price cuts, according to industry executives and filings by some suppliers.Honeywell on Friday portrayed a combined Honeywell/United Technologies as a company that would have the resources to hold its own in this environment. Honeywell Chief Executive Dave Cote, in a presentation made to United Technologies on Feb. 19 and made public on Friday, said the two companies together would enjoy ""significant commercial opportunities to drive revenue growth."" A heftier research and development budget could fund investment in new technology. And they could boost profit margins by slashing annual costs by $3.5 billion, cutting redundant staffs and purchasing materials at higher volumes, Honeywell said.Boeing and Airbus aren't waiting for a deal to materialize to express concern about Cote's vision.Airbus Group Chief Executive Tom Enders said the deal would not be in his company's interest. Boeing said it would scrutinize the implications, saying in a statement: ""Healthy competition in our supply chain is vitally important to Boeing and our commercial and military customers."" The aircraft makers have used leverage afforded by their supply contracts to renegotiate pricing for components under certain conditions, including when a company is sold. Those negotiations can be protracted and complex, even when a big merger is not at stake. Boeing and another large supplier, Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), for example, have been in talks since November 2014 on new contracts governing parts for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and other aircraft, according to regulatory filings and people familiar with the discussions. While it may be impractical to shift fuselage, wing section and other large components to new suppliers, Boeing can ""trim around the edges"" by moving smaller parts, said a source familiar with the talks. ""And those smaller parts are more profitable.""United Technologies, in a lengthy statement opposing the Honeywell overture, argued that the aircraft makers would see to it that the combined companies had to cut prices by 5 to 10 percent.

139,"   By Ankit Ajmera and Andrea Shalal  U.S. industrial conglomerate United Technologies on Friday rejected a $90.7 billion offer by rival aerospace supplier Honeywell International Inc, saying that pursuing a merger would be ""irresponsible"" toward its shareholders.In an unusual move, the two companies sparred publicly about a deal that, if realized, would create one of the largest U.S. companies with almost $100 billion in annual sales. Major customers also weighed in, with Boeing saying it would careful scrutinize a deal and underscoring the need for ""healthy competition"" in its supply chain.United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) said the two companies had talked about a possible combination for years.But it said the regulatory environment had changed and a merger now would either be blocked outright, or any synergies would be far outweighed by regulatory delays, required divestitures, and customer concerns and concessions.""It would be irresponsible for UTC to move forward with the proposed combination,"" the company said in a regulatory filing.United Tech's filing came hours after Honeywell (HON.N) spelled out the details of its $90.7 billion offer to acquire United Tech, putting pressure on the reluctant aerospace supplier to come to the negotiating table.Honeywell Chief Executive Officer David Cote, in a presentation he made to United Tech's top executives last week and then made public on Friday, said a combined company would have double-digit earnings growth after it slashed costs.United Tech shares, part of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, closed 0.4 percent lower at $97.69. That is well below Honeywell's $108 per share offer, suggesting Wall Street, like United Tech, was skeptical about the combination. ""Game on.... There is clear momentum in this saga, and a ratcheting up of the tensions,"" wrote Rob Stallard with RBC Capital Markets. He cited concerns about business overlap, and said there were unresolved questions about achievable synergies, management roles, cultural fit, and merger premiums. Jeff Bialos, a law partner with Sutherland Asbill & Brennan and a former senior Pentagon official, said he was not convinced that the regulatory environment was as tough as United Tech said. Divestitures were always possible, but United Tech likely did not want to cede control to Honeywell, he said.United Tech is the parent of Otis elevators, Carrier air conditioners and Pratt & Whitney jet engines, while Honeywell makes thermostats, auto turbochargers and airplane cockpit electronics.Areas of overlap between the companies include small aircraft engines, airplane power units and environmental systems as well as wheels and brakes, CRT Capital analyst Peter Arment said in a note to clients. Honeywell would likely have to divest many assets and raise its offer before a deal was done, Arment added. U.S. and European regulatory scrutiny would push the deal's completion well into 2017, and potentially into 2018, according to sources familiar with the deal. Honeywell said its offer includes $42.63 in cash and 0.614 of its shares for each United Tech share. The proposal represents a 22 percent premium to United Tech's closing price on Feb. 19, the last trading day before the talks were made public. (bit.ly/1oMD1tg)Honeywell shares closed 1.1 percent lower at $103.03.The companies said earlier this week they had held merger talks but did not offer details. United Tech had said a deal would ""face insurmountable regulatory obstacles.""""It just cannot happen,"" United Tech CEO Greg Hayes said on CNBC television this week. ""There's just no way to get it done."" A merger could either be blocked outright or made conditional on significant divestitures after a lengthy and disruptive review that would destroy shareholder value, United Tech has said. Honeywell, however, said potential regulatory issues would be ""easily resolved."" In its presentation, Honeywell said a deal with United Tech would save $3.5 billion each year by cutting spending on raw materials, consolidating real estate and in other ways. Under the offer, Cote would lead the combined company. United Tech said the merged firm's revenues could fall by $5 billion to $10 billion since the change in “control” would force it to reopen contracts with major aircraft makers, said a source close the matter. That would allow those customers to negotiate lower prices, or even find new suppliers, the source said.A merger would create a behemoth responsible for much of the equipment on commercial airliners and many military aircraft, raising concerns for companies like Airbus (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N), as well as the Pentagon.The combined company would generate about 28 percent of sales from commercial aerospace customers, and 13 percent from the defense and space sector, according to Honeywell's presentation.(This version of the story corrects third paragraph to customers from suppliers) (Additional reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Writing by Nick Zieminski; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Clive McKeef and Tom Brown)",2016-02-27,HON,"Sat Feb 27, 2016 | 3:37am EST",CORRECTED-UPDATE 4-United Tech rejects Honeywell's $90.7 bln offer,http://www.reuters.com//article/unitedtech-ma-honeywell-idUSL2N166044?type=companyNews

142,"  (Repeats story first published on Friday with no changes to text)By Andrea Shalal and Michael FlahertyFeb 26 Honeywell International Inc Chief Executive David Cote was sporting the casual jeans and sweater he often likes to wear in the office when he was visited by his then-counterpart at United Technologies Corp in 2012, Louis Chenevert.With Honeywell's stock trading at around $55, Chenevert had come to discuss offering $65 per share to merge the two U.S. aerospace and automation giants.The idea was not new. The two companies had flirted with it for years, even before General Electric Co's failed bid to acquire Honeywell in 2000. But the talks never advanced beyond initial approaches.That time was no different. Cote responded negatively, telling Chenevert he believed Honeywell's stock would be worth $100 in a few years. He was proven right.While Honeywell's stock has risen more than 80 percent since then, and is near all-time highs, UTC's stock has risen only by a third, and is down a third from its 2015 peak.Cote, 63, sensed an opportunity to turn the tables by unveiling a $90.7 billion bid this week.Even after running Honeywell for 14 years, Cote's appetite for the top job is undiminished. He proposed a deal in which Honeywell would be the buyer and lead the merger, with Cote holding both CEO and chairman titles of the combined company.This account, based on two sources briefed on the meeting and public filings, shows why Honeywell, which had previously shied away from a deal, was happy to confirm its interest in UTC this week from a position of strength. It also illustrates the challenges UTC now faces in resisting a deal.""It is very opportunistic of Dave. I don't blame him, but it's not going to happen,"" Greg Hayes, UTC's CEO since 2014, said on CNBC this week. UTC argues that a merger with Honeywell would face insurmountable antitrust obstacles and strong customer opposition, citing concerns expressed by Airbus Group SE  and Boeing Co. Honeywell says antitrust issues are limited and can be addressed through asset sales.Honeywell has also argued that the combined company, which would have a market capitalization of more than $160 billion, would be able to offer a more comprehensive suite of products and services to customers, with the annualized cost synergies reaching $3.5 billion. UTC disputes that figure, and points out that the asset sales required to receive antitrust approval and customer concessions would destroy a lot of value.""If Honeywell wants to buy at a full and fair price, then yes, I would want to sell,"" said Daniel O'Keefe, portfolio manager at mutual fund manager Artisan Partners, which owns a $212 million stake in United Technologies.INVESTOR DAYS  Honeywell, which has a scheduled investor day on March 2,  has no plans to go hostile with its bid, according to the sources. However, UTC's stock has been rising every day since Honeywell's approach was disclosed on Tuesday, and is now up 10 percent since then, as investors bet on a deal happening.As a result, UTC will have to present a compelling standalone plan at its annual investor day on March 10 to keep its shareholders on board. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company has already been going out of its way to maintain investor support.UTC removed Chenevert in late 2014 after he refused to consider a sale of storied helicopter maker Sikorsky, according to the sources. Chenevert, who now works at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, did not respond to requests for comment.Chenevert was succeeded by Hayes, whose first act was to announce a strategic review of all options. He reached out to Honeywell again in April 2015 to explore a merger, but cooled on the idea after he saw the antitrust environment become more stringent and UTC's stock lost value on disappointing earnings.UTC later sold Sikorsky to Lockheed Martin Corp for $9 billion and agreed to use the proceeds to fund additional share repurchases. BREAKING UP At a time when peers such as General Electric Co have been slimming down to focus on core businesses, UTC has retained its diversity. It makes everything from air conditioners to elevators and fire equipment, to a broad range of aerospace equipment, including tires, cockpits and engines.But UTC's businesses are not all faring equally. Its underperforming Otis elevator division, for example, is facing steep engineering and development costs as the company tries to refresh its product line.In light of UTC's latest snub of Honeywell, it will also have to explain why separating its aerospace from its buildings divisions does not make sense. Hayes has no intention of breaking up the company, according to a source familiar with his thinking. Instead, it will focus on initiatives such as its investment in its Pratt & Whitney turbofan engines.""In terms of capital allocation and portfolio management, UTC has done a pretty good job of looking after shareholders and its assets. But you could argue that the company could be broken up,"" Artisan Partners' O'Keefe said.The fact that UTC and Honeywell have the same top six shareholders - Vanguard Group, BlackRock, MFS Investment, Wellington Management, JPMorgan Asset Management and State Street - means that both companies are largely playing to the same audience.Vanguard, BlackRock, JPMorgan and Wellington declined to comment. MFS and State Street did not respond to requests for comment.The advanced notice period to propose board members at UTC's annual meeting expired on Jan. 28, so any activist investor would have to wait a year to submit a slate of board directors. As of Dec. 31, no major activist hedge fund was invested in the company's shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.

150,"   By Joel Schectman and Susan Heavey | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A new U.S. export restriction against China's ZTE Corp (000063.SZ) for alleged Iran sanctions violations is likely to disrupt the telecom manufacturer's sprawling global supply chain and could create substantial parts shortages, according to sanctions experts.Under the measure announced by the Commerce Department on Monday, U.S. manufacturers will be banned from selling components to ZTE, which is a major global supplier of telecom-networking equipment. In addition, foreign manufacturers will be prohibited from selling products containing a significant amount of U.S.-made parts to the Chinese company.The Commerce Department, confirming the decision that was first reported by Reuters on Saturday, said ZTE planned to use a series of shell companies “to illicitly reexport controlled items to Iran in violation of U.S. export control laws."" It said ZTE acted ""contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.""While ZTE suppliers can apply for an export license to ship any American-made equipment or parts, the Commerce Department said such license applications generally will be denied.   The export restriction, which does not stop ZTE from selling handsets in the United States, is expected to have a global impact.“It is going to have a large ripple effect. It’s very significant to many companies both in the U.S. and (outside the) U.S.,” said Doug Jacobson, an export attorney at law firm Jacobson Burton Kelley PLLC, who said he has been fielding calls from clients who supply ZTE since Reuters broke news of the impending export restrictions.For example, a Taiwanese chipmaker that uses American-made components to make processors for ZTE handsets would likely have to cut off those sales. If the Taiwanese supplier only procures components from outside the United States it can continue to sell to ZTE, experts said.“I am telling all my clients today that anything (for ZTE)not already on board an airplane going to China, you cannot ship it starting tonight. They have to scrub and screen their customers lists – pending orders and future orders – to make sure that any transactions with ZTE are flagged and stopped.”ZTE, which has annual sales of more than $15 billion and is the only Chinese smartphone maker with a meaningful presence in the U.S. market, can appeal the decision. ZTE is among the largest companies that the Commerce Department has hit with a near-total export ban, according to public records. In 2014, the department restricted exports to Russian energy companies Lukoil OAO and Gazprom OAO, but those restrictions only stopped American companies from supplying certain types of oil-production projects, such as Arctic offshore and deepwater drilling.  EFFECT ON HANDSET PRODUCTION ZTE is the No. 4 smartphone vendor in the United States, with a 7 percent market share, behind Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Samsung Electronics Co (005930.KS) and LG Electronics Inc (066570.KS), according to research firm IDC. It sells handset devices to three of the four largest U.S. mobile carriers - AT&T (T.N), T-Mobile US (TMUS.O) and Sprint Corp (S.N).Although ZTE is not being banned from selling handsets in the United States, the restriction could disrupt handset production if ZTE sources U.S.-made parts to manufacture its handsets, experts said. AT&T declined to comment, and T-Mobile and Sprint did not respond to requests for comment.A ZTE website states that several leading U.S. technology companies, including Microsoft (MSFT.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O), IBM (IBM.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), are ""key strategic partners."" Intel and Qualcomm confirmed they were ZTE suppliers, but did not elaborate on specific products sold to the Chinese company or how sanctions would affect their businesses.Texas Instruments (TXN.O), which has also said it provides processors for the Chinese company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The impact of the new restrictions on these three companies was not immediately clear as most of them produce components both in the United States and overseas. Microsoft, in an emailed statement, said, ""We follow U.S. law and will review new U.S. restrictions.""A spokeswoman for Microsoft said the company had a licensing agreement with ZTE but could not confirm if ZTE purchases other products, such as software.The other U.S. companies did not respond to requests for comment.The U.S. decision could even prompt suppliers to halt sales of non-U.S. components that are still allowed, said Kay Georgi, an export attorney at law firm Arent Fox LLP.""When you get placed on one of these lists nobody wants to do business with you at all,"" Georgi said. The United States has long banned the sale of U.S.-made technology products to Iran as part of its sanctions, even as China maintains close diplomatic, economic, trade and energy ties with Tehran. Last year, the United States and major world powers reached a deal with Iran to loosen economic sanctions in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.""We hope this sends a strong message to ZTE, to China, and to other Chinese telecommunications companies who present serious national security risks not only by evading export controls, but by purposefully compromising supply chain security,"" said Representative Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee.

151,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK United Technologies Corp (UTX.N), maker of jet engines, aircraft components and building systems, said it is open to doing a large acquisition despite rejecting a merger proposed by Honeywell International Inc (HON.N).""I wouldn't be afraid to do a big deal,"" Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said at an investor meeting on Thursday. But ""it's got to be something that's actionable ... and the regulatory hurdles have to be manageable.""Hayes said there was appetite in UTC's commercial businesses, including elevators, fire and security systems, and possibly its aerospace systems business, to make a sizable acquisition.UTC recently scotched an approach by Honeywell because the deal faced ""very real"" obstacles from regulators and customers, Hayes said.Without an acquisition, the company is poised for ""huge growth"" based in part on urbanization and rising disposable incomes in the developing world, he said. ""We don't need M&A for growth,"" Hayes said, noting the company was not looking to increase debt for a short-term stock gain.Asked if the company was concerned about pressure from activist investors following the Honeywell approach, Hayes pointed to two board appointments the company made in December: T. Rowe Price Group Inc Chairman Brian Rogers and Frederic Reynolds, former Chief Financial Officer of CBS. ""We brought these guys on because we needed the voice of the investor on the board,"" Hayes said. UTC forecast compounded annual revenue growth of 5 percent to 8 percent through the end of the decade. Its Pratt & Whitney aircraft engine division is poised for revenue growth in excess of 10 percent a year over that period.The investment in aerospace systems and Pratt has positioned those units for ""nearly a trillion dollars in future business over next 25 years,"" Hayes said, referring to sales. Pratt engines, both those already in service and those already sold, will account for $750 billion of the total, he said. The Otis elevator unit is aiming to boost growth, after recent years when efforts to widen profit margins cost it market share. The company said it cut its forecast for heating, ventilation and air conditioning sales this year to low single-digit growth from mid single-digit growth, mainly due to slow sales in the Middle East.""The work there has come to pretty much of a halt due to what's going on in the oil industry,"" said Bob McDonough, president of the Climate, Controls and Security business.

162,"  The head of marketing for the U.S. online business of Wal-Mart Stores has left the retailer to return to a business-conference firm he founded, a company statement said on Thursday.The departure of Brian Monahan after three years at Wal-Mart was announced by NewCo, the startup he helped launch in 2012 in San Francisco with media industry veteran John Battelle. A spokesman for Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, confirmed that Monahan's last day was April 1.""We’re thankful for the great contributions Brian made to the business and wish him the best with NewCo. We’re in the process of identifying a successor,"" Wal-Mart spokesman Dan Toporek said.In the statement Monahan said he was ""compelled to dive back in and help"" the management team at NewCo, citing the momentum of the business and the launch of new editorial products. Monahan's title is ""Chief Evangelist"". NewCo holds its conferences inside the offices of start-ups in various cities around the world, attempting to offer something different than traditional business seminars and introduce up-and-coming companies to investors and entrepreneurs.Monahan joined Wal-Mart in 2013 as Vice President of Marketing for the website. In that role he was in charge of the overall online marketing strategy. In December, Wal-Mart rejigged the top of its marketing team, with Tony Rogers, formerly head of marketing in China, becoming chief marketing officer, replacing the retiring Stephen Quinn. The retailer also brought in former Target Corp CMO Michael Francis as a consultant, a move that was seen by some observers as a sign it was looking to tweak its marketing approach.Wal-Mart's online sales growth has slowed in recent months, going from 17 percent in the first quarter of the last fiscal year to 16 percent in the second, 10 percent in the third and 8 percent in the fourth quarter ended on Jan. 31. Wal-Mart has attributed the drop-off to weakness overseas, including in China and Brazil, and says that its online business in the United States has been good. The company does not disclose a detailed breakdown of sales in each market.

188,"  Diversified industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) agreed to buy distribution systems and logistics company Intelligrated Inc for $1.5 billion from a company backed by the Permira funds.Reuters reported on Thursday that Japan's Toyota Industries Corp (6201.T) was competing with Honeywell for Intelligrated, which installs automated material handling equipment to serve online retailers.Last week, Intelligrated's larger peer Dematic was bought by German forklift truck maker Kion Group AG (KGX.DE) for $3.25 billion to expand into automated warehouses and supply chains that have ballooned with the growth of e-commerce.

192,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Japan's Toyota Industries Corp (6201.T) is competing against U.S. diversified industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) to acquire U.S. distribution systems and logistics company Intelligrated Inc, people familiar with the matter said.The strong interest in the company follows German forklift truck maker Kion Group AG's (KGX.DE) agreement last week to buy Intelligrated's larger peer Dematic for $3.25 billion to expand into automated warehouses and supply chains that have ballooned with the growth of e-commerce.A deal for Intelligrated could come in days and value the privately held company at around $1.5 billion, including debt, the people said this week. There is no certainty, however, that any acquisition agreement will be reached, the people cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Honeywell declined to comment. Toyota Industries and Intelligrated did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Intelligrated, based in Mason, Ohio, manufactures, services and installs high-speed automated material handling equipment in customer distribution centers that primarily serve online retailers. Private equity firm Permira Advisers LLC acquired Intelligrated in 2012 for more than $500 million from Gryphon Investors, another private equity firm. Reuters reported in March that Permira was working with Centerview Partners Holdings LLC and Nomura Co Ltd (9716.T) on an auction for Intelligrated. Due to increased online sales and demand for faster delivery times, the market for supply chain automation is expected to grow by 10 percent by 2019, Kion said in its presentation on the Dematic deal last week.

193,"  * Temasek to report annual results later this week* Temasek portfolio expected to show first drop in value in 7 yrs* Portfolio hit by drop in StanChart value, China slowdown* U.S. focus on health, tech and consumer segments-sourcesBy Anshuman Daga and Saeed AzharSINGAPORE, July 4 Singapore sovereign investor Temasek is set to pounce on U.S. deals and look for co-investments with private equity partners to offset its first annual decline in the value of its assets in seven years, bankers and people familiar with the strategy said.Temasek, one of Asia's most active state investors, has seen its nearly 16 percent stake in London-based Standard Chartered  drop 55 percent in value over the past financial year while its Asian investments have been hit by China's economic slowdown.The 10 percent drop in sterling against the Singapore dollar that followed Britain's vote to leave the European Union has also depressed the value of the Standard Chartered stake. Temasek said it will offer details of its performance when it reports results this week, as well as give some indication as to where it sees future investment opportunities.The investor promoted former M&A lawyer Dilhan Pillay Sandrasegara as president of its international business and head of its Americas team on May 1 with a view to accelerate its investment in that region, especially in technology, consumer and healthcare, the people familiar with Temasek's strategy told Reuters..Since the appointment, Dhilan has been actively meeting companies in Silicon Valley, where he is spending a considerable part of his time every month, the people said.""Dilhan is a very smart guy, I am sure he will hire some people and build a team,"" said a senior banker, who works closely with Temasek. ""They have a lot of dry powder that can be deployed."" Temasek doesn't disclose its net cash position.Last month, Temasek formed an advisory group comprising executives from global firms such as PepsiCo and Honeywell International as it seeks U.S. investments.Singaporean and Chinese firms make up over half of Temasek's S$266 billion ($197 billion) portfolio. Enrico Soddu, head of data and research at the Sovereign Wealth Centre in London, expects the value of the portfolio to have fallen by 5-10 percent from a year earlier, mainly hit by China. This would be the first decline since 2009. The portfolio rose by nearly a fifth in the year ended March 2015.Temasek has done few big deals in the West in recent years. It was stung by an investment into Bank of America-Merrill Lynch  in the run up to the global financial crisis, an investment that proved loss-making.This year, it sold its $1.6 billion stake in shipping firm Neptune Orient Lines and last month pared its stake in China Construction Bank. It also invested in Alibaba  and Korea's Homeplus.But it failed to beat its own internal benchmark called 'Wealth added' in five of the last eight financial years. Temasek's returns have fallen below its risk-adjusted hurdle in five of the last, as per its last annual report.""They are certainly recognising that they need more experience and more skill sets to invest in developed markets,"" said Soddu.Ten companies, including Singapore Telecommunications , DBS Group and China Construction Bank, account for half of Temasek's assets.Temasek, the biggest shareholder in Standard Chartered , is willing to give the bank's management more time on its turnaround before taking a decision on the stake, people familiar with the matter said.

205,"   By Lauren Hirsch and Greg Roumeliotis  Honeywell International Inc is in talks to acquire JDA Software Group Inc, in a deal that could value the U.S. supply chain management software company at around $3 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.The acquisition would illustrate how Honeywell, a U.S. diversified industrial conglomerate, is keen to boost its automation portfolio after it agreed last month to acquire Intelligrated Inc, a U.S. distribution systems and logistics company, for $1.5 billion.JDA Software's majority owner, buyout firm New Mountain Capital LLC, has already explored a sale of the company to private equity firms, and there is no certainty its latest talks with Honeywell will result in a deal, the people said on Monday.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Honeywell, New Mountain Capital and JDA Software declined to comment. JDA Software, based in Scottsdale, Arizona, provides retail and supply chain planning and execution solutions for more than 4,000 corporate customers worldwide.The company has been struggling under the burden of more than $2 billion in debt. Earlier this year, credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service warned that JDA Software's debt levels might be unsustainable and that the risk of impairment in its capital structure would be high without a sizeable equity infusion or reduction in debt. Exacerbating JDA Software's woes has been fierce competition among software vendors for products in supply chain planning, transportation and warehouse management.Honeywell, on the other hand, has been looking to beef up its sensing and productivity solutions division, as the rise of internet shopping fuels demand for warehouses and logistics that speed up delivery and lower costs. New Mountain took JDA Software private in 2012 for $1.9 billion and then merged it with a company called RedPrairie.

225,"  PARIS Shares in French aircraft seats maker Zodiac Aerospace (ZODC.PA) rose sharply on Monday after U.S. rival B/E Aerospace (BEAV.O) agreed to be bought by Rockwell Collins for $6.4 billion.The move to create a new aerospace supplier with revenue of more than $8 billion breathed new life into the concept of combining aircraft interiors with providers of systems and connectivity, as planemakers shift towards smarter cabins.However, some analysts questioned the synergies involved in the purchase of B/E Aerospace, suggesting it could also be a partly defensive move as aerospace merger activity picks up.Shares in Zodiac Aerospace rose as much as 4 percent and were briefly the second-top gainer in France's SBF 120 Eclaireur index. At 0517 EDT the stock was up 2.3 percent at 21.945 euros.Rockwell Collins said on Sunday it had agreed to buy B/E Aerospace, one of the aircraft industry's largest cabin interior makers alongside Zodiac, for $62 a share, or $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt.A Paris-based analyst, asking not to be identified, said the deal raised bid speculation around Zodiac, with the two most likely candidates to acquire it being France's Safran (SAF.PA) and U.S. conglomerate United Technologies (UTX.N).Safran (SAF.PA) made an informal attempt to buy Zodiac in 2010 but was rebuffed by Zodiac's family shareholders. Sources familiar with the matter recently denied reports that Safran was considering a fresh approach as it focuses on a steep production ramp-up in its main engines business. NOT FOR SALE  Other top suppliers seen as keen to expand include Honeywell (HON.N), which failed to grab United Technologies this year.Zodiac Aerospace management have repeatedly said the company is not for sale. Rockwell Collins said the B/E deal would expand its scale.""Our tentative conclusion from this language is that the rationale is one of scale and product breadth, aftermarket mix enhancement, and finally product synergy,"" Raymond James analyst Harry Breach said in a note.The deal increases Rockwell Collins' exposure to a record pipeline of commercial aerospace equipment purchases and boosts its relatively limited exposure to lucrative aftermarkets. However it leaves the combined company vulnerable to any reduction in aircraft production plans as the aerospace cycle enters a slowdown, ending several years of record orders.Analysts cautioned those considerations would also have to be weighed in any bid for Zodiac.Others noted Zodiac is pricier than competitors as investors factor in a recovery from recent industrial problems.Its current share price implies an enterprise value of 24 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, or almost twice the multiple of 12.6 times forecast 2017 earnings being paid for B/E, according to Thomson Reuters data.""We'd be surprised if B/E Aerospace receives a higher offer given the full price (and) concerns about widebody aircraft delivery rates,"" Cowen & Co analysts said in a note.

231,"   By Jean-Baptiste Vey and Geert De Clercq | PARIS  PARIS Chinese, Kazakh and Japanese firms are in talks to invest in Areva (AREVA.PA), according to a French government source, a partnership deal that could help persuade regulators that a rescue plan for the nuclear group is not illegal state aid.The source said talks are set to end in two to three weeks. A second industrial source said that once the partnership investment deal is sealed, the European Commission will be ready to approve Areva's government-led restructuring by the end of December ahead of a planned 5 billion euro ($5.4 billion) mainly state-funded capital increase early next year. French online news website BFM Business, citing sources close to the group, reported on Tuesday that China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC), Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (7011.T) and Kazakhstan's Kazatomprom were each set to buy an 11 percent stake in Areva.Japan's MHI is a long-time Areva industrial partner with whom Areva is developing a new reactor model. Kazatomprom is a major uranium miner, with which Areva has a mining joint venture, while CNNC also has partnerships with Areva under which it may build a nuclear fuel recycling plant in China. BFM reported that the three foreign investors would inject 400 million euros each, that they would be able to chose board members, and that the French government's stake in Areva would fall to 67 percent.Areva declined to comment on the BFM Business report.      CNNC, Mitsubishi and Kazatomprom were not immediately available for comment.EDF CONNECTION The three-way investment would be for a one-third stake in Areva ""NewCo"", the as yet unnamed uranium mining and nuclear fuel business of Areva, which will be split off when the rest of the firm is absorbed by EDF (EDF.PA), the state power utility, under the rescue plan.  A major global player in the nuclear fuel industry, NewCo is set to get three billion euros of the five billion euro capital injection in order to repay debt and restore equity wiped out by years of losses.The nuclear reactor building unit of the virtually bankrupt state-owned group, Areva NP, will be bought by fellow state-owned utility EDF for 2.5 billion euros, which signed a binding takeover deal last week.A third part of Areva - Areva SA - will get a 2 billion euro capital increase and will hold the troubled Olkiluoto reactor construction project in Finland and other legacy activities that are earmarked for sale, including Areva's 50 percent state in Areva-Gamesa (GAM.MC) offshore wind joint venture Adwen, and Areva's military nuclear business. BFM Business also reported that the state, which owns 87 percent of Areva, would buy out Areva's current minority shareholders. They include the Kuwait Investment Authority (which holds 4.82 percent), EDF (2.24 percent), Areva staff (1.23 percent) and oil group Total (0.95 percent), according to ThomsonReuters data. Then the company would be delisted.Once the three foreign investors sign the deal to buy their one-third stake in Newco, the European Commission is expected to give the green light for Areva's restructuring and capital increase in which the French state will contribute the lion's share. Without the participation of third-party investors in the capital increase, the European Commission would qualify the injection of French state funds as illegal state aid.A source familiar with the situation said the government hopes to get EU clearance for the deal at the latest before Christmas.Areva chairman Philippe Varin is set to address a French parliament committee hearing on Wednesday.
