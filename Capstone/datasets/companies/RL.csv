2,"   By Junko Fujita | TOKYO  TOKYO Japan's Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T) is in final talks to buy the building rented by luxury retailer Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) for its flagship store in Tokyo's posh Omotesando area for about 35 billion yen ($342 million), three people with knowledge of the deal said.The purchase by Mitsubishi, Japan's biggest trading firm by net income, will be the largest property transaction since a group of investors bought an office building in Tokyo for about 100 billion yen last August. The price represents a premium of about 13 percent on that paid the last time the building changed hands, four years ago.The deal for the four-storey building occupied by the New York brand in the center of one of Tokyo's most fashionable districts comes as hopes grow among real estate operators that retail rents in general are set to rise amid growing interest in opening stores in the city.As part of his efforts to bring sustained growth to the world's third-biggest economy, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has promoted monetary, fiscal and structural reforms - dubbed ""Abenomics"" - that are stoking retail sales, fueling demand for store space in the capital's sprawl of shopping districts.Mitsubishi, with an array of businesses in finance, machinery, chemicals and energy, is aiming to buy the building from a group comprising Japanese property investor Secured Capital Investment Management, financial services company Orix Corp (8591.T) and Honolulu-based Trinity Investments.The current owners paid 31 billion yen for the eight-year-old, 7,421 square-meter property in 2010 when the market slowed in the wake of the global financial crisis. Japan's property business began to rebound last year, boosted by Prime Minister Abe's pro-growth economic policies. Also present on Omotesando are stores operated by the biggest names in the luxury goods business, including LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA's (LVMH.PA) Bulgari, Celine and Vuitton brands, Kering SA's (PRTP.PA) Gucci and privately owned Chanel.Both domestic and overseas retailers have ambitions to open stores in primary Tokyo shopping districts like Omotesando and the central Ginza area, said Hajime Shibata, a senior consultant at the Japanese unit of global commercial real estate service firm CBRE.The Mitsubishi deal will follow the acquisition of another landmark Tokyo retail property, a building housing a Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) store in Ginza. It was bought by Masayoshi Son, the billionaire founder of tech and telecoms group Softbank Corp (9984.T), for 32 billion yen in September. Shibata said Omotesando remains a draw for retailers because the area attracts fashion-conscious shoppers. While Omotesando offers an array of upscale stores, it's also located close to Harajuku, an area popular with younger buyers of Tokyo's funky street styles.""The market for retail properties in Tokyo has a positive outlook and we can expect the rents will start increasing,"" said Shibata.Low-cost financing will also fuel property deals. ""Investors will remain aggressive this year because they can continue borrowing money cheaply,"" said Takashi Ishizawa, chief real estate analyst at Mizuho Securities Co.A Mitsubishi spokeswoman declined to comment on the transaction. Officials for the current owners also declined to comment. Ralph Lauren was not immediately available for comment.Mitsubishi already has a substantial presence in Japan's property markets with its real estate asset management firm Diamond Realty Management Inc, which operates a private real estate trust.

10,"  Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) warned on Friday that its efforts to open more stores would erode operating profit margin at the luxury fashion house in the fiscal year through March 2015, and that sales growth would also be slower.The company's shares fell 6.7 percent to $142 in premarket trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Ralph Lauren, whose brands include Club Monaco stores, Chaps and its namesake brands, gets about 54 percent of its sales through department stores such as Macy's Inc (M.N) and other retailers. But in recent years, it has been opening more stores to have more control over the brands.The company plans to spend $400 million to $500 million on capital projects in the new fiscal year, and expects operating profit margin to fall between 0.75 and 1.25 percentage points as a result. In comparison, Macy's plans to spend about $1 billion but is about four times larger in terms of revenue.The push comes amid tepid sales in its retail business. Sales at its own stores open at least a year fell 1 percent in the fourth quarter ended March 29, while wholesale revenue jumped 24 percent, lifted by big gains in the Americas. Ralph Lauren projects global revenues will rise between 6 percent and 8 percent, a slower pace of growth than the 9 percent increase in the year through March 2014. Total revenue in the fourth quarter rose 13.6 percent to $1.87 billion, the company said. Net income rose 20.5 percent to $153 million, or $1.68 per share, from $127 million, or $1.37, a year earlier.The company also announced Friday that Roger Farah, the long-time executive whom many in the fashion industry credit with turning Ralph Lauren into a global powerhouse, will retire at the end of May.(Reporting by Phil Wahba in New York; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Bernadette Baum)",2014-05-09,RL,"Fri May 9, 2014 | 9:21am EDT",Ralph Lauren store expansions to hurt profit margin in fiscal 2015,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-ralphlauren-results-idUSBREA480DQ20140509?type=companyNews

21,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A Manhattan federal judge said Ralph Lauren Corp may try to hold the U.S. Polo Association in contempt for using a logo that resembles its iconic polo player logo, but put the case on hold for a related arbitration.In a decision made public on Monday, U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan said Ralph Lauren could pursue claims that the ""double horsemen"" logo used to advertise USPA retail stores, including in New York's Times Square, and online stores was too similar to Ralph Lauren's logo of a polo player atop a horse.Sullivan said the USPA's depictions, which Ralph Lauren said appear to make the two horsemen blur together, ""certainly appear to be the very mark"" prohibited under a 2005 jury verdict and 2012 injunction. But Sullivan stayed the case while an arbitrator decides whether Ralph Lauren's claims should be arbitrated, saying the case would be ""greatly simplified"" following arbitration. The decision is dated March 27. Lawyers for Ralph Lauren and the USPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Sullivan's decision is the latest installment in litigation that began in 1984 between the parties over their logos. Separately on Monday, Indian textile company Arvind Ltd  said it would pay Ralph Lauren $3.2 million to settle a lawsuit claiming it sold USPA products in India that lacked hangtags showing that Polo Ralph Lauren had nothing to do with the products.

34,"  American designer Ralph Lauren, who built a fashion powerhouse on luxury designs inspired by country club chic, announced Tuesday he is stepping down as chief executive officer and named the head of Gap Inc's populist Old Navy brand to the position.Ralph Lauren Corp, founded by 75-year-old Lauren in 1967, appointed Stefan Larsson, the global president of Gap's Old Navy division, as CEO effective in November. Lauren will continue to serve as executive chairman and head its design team, the company said in a statement.  Lauren, who got his start designing neckties, plans to stay active at the company and Larsson will report to him. “When they start designing things I can’t understand, I’ll quit,” Lauren told the New York Times in an interview. Ralph Lauren shares rose 3.79 percent to $108 in trading after the bell on the news. The company has been struggling to boost profits as a stronger dollar reduces the value of sales from overseas. Net revenue in its first quarter ended June 27 fell 5 percent, mainly due to currency effects.  Odeon Capital analyst Rick Snyder said the company had grown to a size where it needed more ""systems and controls."" The change in CEO ""is just a natural progression,"" Snyder said.Milton Pedraza, a fashion industry analyst at the Luxury Institute, said Larsson’s appointment follows a trend of luxury brands hiring leaders from mass-market companies in recent months. He cited the appointment of Grita Loebsack, a former vice president at Unilever Plc, as CEO of Kering's emerging brands, which include Stella McCartney and Gucci. Larsson is credited with reviving sales at the Old Navy division, successfully implementing a model of offering trendy clothes at low prices.Annual sales at the business rose 8 percent in 2014 and became Gap's biggest business. Sales for the division were $6.62 billion, or 40.3 percent of Gap's total. Lauren's fashion empire includes some 25 brands including the Polo, Club Monaco and Denim & Supply, and the company makes clothing, accessories, furniture, home decor items and footwear under its labels.   FROM WILD WEST TO HIP HOP   Despite the aura of Anglo-Saxon elitism around his company, Lauren was born Ralph Lifshitz in the Bronx in 1939. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Belarus, and he changed his name to Lauren at age 16.  Despite his humble roots, Lauren's designs drew inspiration from elite and exotic realms including East Coast prepsters, the Wild West, colonists on African safari and czarist Russia. He designed the wardrobe for the 1974 film version of ""The Great Gatsby"" including a pink suit for star Robert Redford.  The Ralph Lauren Polo shirt, which debuted in 1972, became a signature item for the company with a tiny polo player embroidered on the chest. His designs have been worn by presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, actress Gwyneth Paltrow and actor Johnny Depp.Lauren was also, perhaps surprisingly, influential in the hip hop world. His bright colors and bold clothing became staples for some New York gangs, and rappers such as Kanye West and Lil Wayne have mentioned Lauren and his designs in their rhymes. The company also said that Jackwyn Nemerov, chief operating officer, would retire in November at which time she will become an adviser to the company.

40,"   By Tom Hals | WILMINGTON, Del  WILMINGTON, Del Oct 22 First Data Corp's Chief Executive Officer Frank Bisignano hailed a $3.5 billion fund-raising in July 2014 for drawing a ""who's who in equity investing"" and paving the way for the payment processor's huge IPO last week.The 2014 deal included one unusual investor: Lehman Brothers, the bank that collapsed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.Lehman may be long gone from Wall Street, but its bankruptcy estate still manages a portfolio of more than $10 billion in assets, exceeding the market capitalization of fashion house Ralph Lauren Corp or property investment firm Kimco Realty Corp.From an office in Manhattan, Lehman's staff manage piles of cash and securities, interests in real estate and private equity investments, including a stake in Formula One motor racing.While bankruptcy estates focus on liquidating assets for the benefit of creditors, Lehman dusted off its investing expertise last year and spent $151 million on private placement of stock in First Data.According to a court filing, the money was spent on a ""pro-rata"" share of the private placement, indicating Lehman had a previous relationship with First Data. Lehman provided financing in 2007 for the buyout of First Data, which was led by KKR & Co.""When you get a $3.5 billion vote of confidence by some fabulous investors,"" Bisignano told an analysts call in July 2014, ""the who's who in equity investing in it gives your customers great confidence in your ability."" The private placement of stock was credited by Bisignano for providing cash to pay down First Data's debt and returning the company to profit after years of losses.Lehman's management can make investments if they determine it will likely benefit creditors.Lehman and First Data declined to comment on the Lehman stake.Lehman did not disclose how the First Data investment performed. KKR, which was the lead investor in the 2014 private placement, has estimated in securities filings the value of its investment in First Data rose about 13 percent from the private placement through June 30. However, those gains may have been offset after First Data cut the IPO price by 20 percent from the top of its target range.Shares in First Data were little changed at $15.36 on Thursday, below the $16 IPO price.COMPLEX CASES  Lehman emerged from bankruptcy in 2012 with a new board selected by creditors, overseen by Chairman David Pauker, formerly the executive managing director of Goldin Associates, a financial consultancy. Christopher O'Meara, a former chief financial officer of Lehman, is the chief executive.""I do think it's remarkable both how significant Lehman's assets have turned out to be and how much they still have,"" said David Skeel, a professor at University of Pennsylvania Law School.The First Data deal is not even the largest investment by the bankrupt firm. In 2012, it ponied up about $3 billion to buy two minority positions held by other banks in Archstone, an owner of apartment complexes, giving it full ownership. It later sold Archstone for $6.5 billion.Lehman had teamed up with Tishman Speyer to acquire Archstone for $22.2 billion, including debt, in 2007.In total, Lehman's bankruptcy estate has distributed $105.4 billion to creditors. Of that, $77.2 billion was paid to third-party claims, with the rest paid to other Lehman affiliates. While more than $1 trillion of claims were filed, the estate will recognize about $330 billion, according to court documents.Jonathan Lipson, a professor at Temple University School of Law, said the case could still require years of work as the estate pursues lingering litigation and awaits overseas affiliates to complete their liquidations.""Enron's estate lasted forever and ever,"" Lipson said, referring to the power company that filed in 2001 and closed its bankruptcy case only last year. ""That's what happens with really complex cases.""

44,"   By Melissa Fares and Gina Cherelus | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Michael Kors Holdings Ltd and Ralph Lauren Corp were among the top-mentioned brands by social media users during New York Fashion Week, the result of a push by fashion houses to build buzz among fans who otherwise would not be exposed to their shows.Both companies were among the top five brands that received the most mentions on Twitter Inc	 during the week, which occurs twice a year and is considered one of the industry's highest exposure events, according to marketing technology company Amobee Brand Intelligence.Michael Kors received 70,902 related tweets and Ralph Lauren garnered 46,971 tweets from the start of Fashion Week on Feb 11 through its finish on Thursday.The brands had elaborate social media strategies, which included behind-the-scenes videos on the messaging app Snapchat and live footage of shows on Twitter's streaming video service Periscope.  As of Friday, they were also among the top five mentioned brands at event venues on Facebook Inc's photo-sharing app Instagram, according to data from Ground Signal, a location-based social media search company.  Engaging with users of social media is increasingly important to designers because it helps them draw attention of consumers, not only buyers and press who attend the show.The strategy is also a way to reach younger fans. According to Ground Signal, roughly a third of Instagram posts were from users under the age of 25.  “We know we need to be where our customer is, and today she is on all of these platforms consuming more content more quickly than ever before,” Lisa Pomerantz, a Michael Kors spokeswoman, said by email. Chatter on social media sites can drive demand for designers' collections. Rebecca Minkoff, a maker of luxury handbags and clothing, promoted designs on several platforms under the hashtag #SeeBuyWear. Its New York-based store did four times its usual business following Saturday's show, a Minkoff spokeswoman said in an email. Major fashion houses did not receive the same level of attention as widely known music artists with their own fashion lines. According to Amobee, rapper Kanye West's Yeezy line drew more than 800,000 tweets, and singer Rihanna's Fenty x Puma collection brought in over 140,000, topping the list when it came to Twitter traffic.Other brands with significant Twitter mentions included PVH Corp's Tommy Hilfiger, Malan Breton and Coach Inc.

45,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Target Corp's (TGT.N) quarterly sales at established stores topped analysts' estimates as its initiatives around higher-profit items drove traffic, showing that the company's turnaround efforts under CEO Brian Cornell were gaining traction.The U.S. retailer, whose shares rose as much as 4 percent to $76.95, also forecast a higher-than-expected adjusted profit for the full year.Same-store sales at rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) missed market expectations last week, hurt by a strong dollar and sluggish apparel demand.Target's apparel sales rose in the fourth quarter, in contrast to weak sales at several retailers including Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N).Cornell, Target's chief executive since August 2014, has been aggressively trying to turnaround the company after several years of sluggish growth.Some of his efforts include promoting and investing in a narrower set of higher-margin ""signature"" categories such as baby and health and wellness, and pulling out of Canada. Comparable sales in higher-margin categories rose by more than three times the company average in the quarter ended Jan. 30, Target said, with  women's apparel, wearable electronics and food being the fastest growing.""Signs that CEO Cornell's strategic initiatives are gaining traction include: 'signature' categories re-accelerating to about 6 percent growth and traffic rising 1.3 percent,"" Sterne Agee analyst Renato Basanta said.Apparel sales were helped by better in-store and online presentation and the stocking of trendier styles, Target finance chief Cathy Smith said on a media call. ""We believe that Target performed somewhat above the market (in apparel) thanks to its more fashion-savvy shopper demographic and its strong marketing efforts around holiday looks,"" Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note.Concerns about a slowdown in Target's digital sales were also alleviated by its 34 percent growth in the quarter, Sterne Agee's Basanta said, terming it ""solid progress for Target's still nascent platform.""The concerns stem from Target's warning in November that it would miss its target of growing online sales by 40 percent in 2015 due to slowing electronic sales. Sales at Target stores open at least 13 months increased 1.9 percent in the quarter, beating the 1.5 percent rise analysts had expected.Excluding items, Target earned $1.52 per share, missing the average estimate by 2 cents, due to promotions.Total sales fell 0.6 percent to $21.63 billion, mainly due to the sale of its pharmacy business to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N).
