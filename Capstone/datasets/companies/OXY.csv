0,"   By Valerie Volcovici and Selam Gebrekidan | WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  WASHINGTON/NEW YORK One of the most important U.S. energy policy lobbying debates this year is shaping up as a remarkably one-sided fight.While a growing number of groups support ending a decades-old U.S. law that effectively bans crude oil exports, few companies and lobbyists publicly oppose the idea.On Tuesday, top oil refiner Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) became the first major company to publicly oppose relaxing the restrictions, a seemingly predictable stance from an industry that has reaped the huge benefits of buying cheaper U.S. crude oil and selling it as refined fuels, often abroad.But some of Valero's natural allies in the fight are steering clear, not wishing to compromise their free-market ideals in defense of a policy that most energy analysts and experts say has become a remnant of a bygone era.""We don't oppose lifting the crude-oil export ban, as we fully support free markets,"" Marathon Petroleum Corp (MPC.N) spokeswoman Stefanie Griffith said in an emailed statement.Phillips 66 (PSX.N) says exports of crude oil and other products ""are good for our country and contribute to a strong balance of trade,"" a spokesman said on Tuesday. The U.S. trade deficit fell to a four-year low in November thanks to shrinking net petroleum imports, government data showed this week.The refiners' lobby group, which helped lead a highly contentious but successful campaign last year to relax the U.S. ethanol mandates, is sticking to its free-market mantra despite the objections of some of its members, Charles Drevna, president of American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, told Reuters this month.U.S. domestic shipping industry executives privately voice support for the ban, but the industry at large has been reluctant to take a position. The shipping industry is benefiting from a surge in rates for U.S.-flagged tankers, which are required by law to move petroleum products between U.S. ports.There is still time for more foes to emerge, of course. Environmental groups that have sought to block coal exports and the Keystone XL pipeline may take up the issue more seriously.Ahead of mid-term elections, some politicians may raise the specter of higher gasoline prices, as New Jersey Democratic Senator Robert Menendez did in a letter to President Barack Obama last month.But without a cohesive lobbying force, even industry insiders see little standing in the way of rising exports.LESSONS FROM GAS LOBBY Thanks to the rise in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies, U.S. crude oil production has surged to the highest level in 25 years, threatening to inundate refiners with a light sweet crude that is easy to refine.As a result, domestic oil prices have fallen to a discount versus similar varieties elsewhere, spurring calls to ease an export ban imposed in 1975 after the Arab oil embargo. Understandably, big producers such as independent Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N) and oil major Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) were the first to call for a review of the ban. U.S. Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz last year said the export ban should be reassessed by the Department of Commerce, which regulates licensing.More surprising is the lack of unanimity among refiners.""I would have thought the independent refiners would stay sort of united on this,"" said Chi Chow, refining industry analyst at Macquarie Group. ""It's definitely in their economic interest to keep the ban in place,"" he said.The battle has echoes of a similar war over the past two years, as natural gas producers sought government approval for exporting liquefied natural gas - over the objection of big consumers such as Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N).But while industrial gas users mounted a compelling macro-economic argument to restrain exports - lower domestic prices will create more jobs - refiners are on a shakier footing given bumper profits and gasoline prices that remain high by historical standards. Exporting crude is unlikely to have a major impact on local pump prices, energy experts say.""My interest is not to protect the refineries' bottom line,"" Senator Lisa Murkowski, the top Republican on the Senate Energy Committee, said on Tuesday after urging a review of the ban. ""They are going to have to deal with it within the industry.""America's Energy Advantage, the coalition of companies led by Dow that opposed unfettered LNG exports, has not taken a position yet on crude exports and does not plan to weigh in on the discussion at this point, spokesman Brock Park said. The coalition appears to be losing that battle: the Obama administration has approved four new requests to export LNG to non-free trade countries in the past year, and is expected to approve more this year, analysts say.For refiners, any public effort to oppose exporting crude could draw more attention to their unfettered overseas shipments of refined fuels like gasoline and diesel, sales of which have trebled over the past 10 years to record highs.A Reuters-IPSOS poll conducted in November showed that American voters are almost evenly divided on the question of U.S. oil exports. But a majority believe gasoline exports should be restricted.ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS KEEP MUM A handful of lawmakers have already spoken out in opposition of the ban, including New Jersey's Menendez and Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts.But the balance of power in Washington may be shifting.Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, a major energy state, is expected to take Democratic Oregon Senator Ron Wyden's place on the committee. She recently suggested she would support lifting the ban if ""scientific data"" showed it necessary. While opponents of the Keystone XL pipeline, such as 350.org, are already lining up to oppose crude oil exports, other environmental groups have yet to craft an approach - even as the debate rapidly accelerates in Washington.The Natural Resources Defense Council ""hasn't been engaged on the issue of oil exports specifically,"" said Kate Slusark Kiely, a spokeswoman for the group. She said the group is focused on ""protecting people and the environment from the risks involved with its development and use.""SHIPPERS STEER CLEAR The U.S. shipping industry would seem a likely opponent of change. With overseas shipments restricted, oil producers have scrambled to secure so-called ""Jones Act"" tankers, the small fleet of U.S.-owned, U.S.-made, and U.S.-crewed vessels that are allowed to carry goods between U.S. ports.Rates for Jones Act tankers and barges owned by companies such as Kirby Corp (KEX.N) and American Petroleum Tankers - being bought by Kinder Morgan Energy Partners KMP.N - have surged as a growing glut of south Texas crude is shipped to other U.S. ports. If exports were allowed, demand could wane.One executive at a U.S.-flag ship company, who declined to be named, said that he was ""fully supportive of the law.""Yet the American Maritime Partnership, which represents the U.S. domestic maritime industry, does not have a position on crude exports, spokesman Joe Brenckle said.With Jones Act rates already three times more expensive than foreign-flagged vessels, industry officials may worry about becoming a target of the debate themselves.""I think there's a fear of being seen as anti-competitive or protectionist. It's a challenge when you compare the rates of, say an MR Jones Act tanker versus a similarly sized international vessel,"" said Ben Nolan, director of maritime research at Stifel, Nicolaus & Company in Chicago.The industry would make unlikely bedfellows with refiners, who have long complained that the Jones Act law inflates costs for refiners on the East Coast.""If indeed this is truly the beginning of the debate, let's make sure the debate includes all the parameters so we fully understand the ramifications of other obstacles of economic growth,"" said Drevna of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers.""We can't look at crude exports in a vacuum. We should also look at the Jones Act and how that hampers development.""(Additional reporting by Anna Louie Sussman and Cezary Podkul; Editing by Jonathan Leff and Lisa Shumaker)",2014-01-08,OXY,"Wed Jan 8, 2014 | 6:15am EST",Analysis: Lobbying fight over U.S. oil exports may be one-sided battle,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-crude-exports-analysis-idUSBREA070I320140108?type=companyNews

Occidental, which is looking to sell a minority stake in its Middle East business, said realized U.S. crude prices rose 8 percent in the quarter ended Dec. 31, helping the company to a net profit of $1.64 billion.At $2.04 per share, earnings were significantly higher than the 42 cents per share earned a year earlier, when the company wrote down the value of gas properties in the U.S. midcontinent by $1.1 billion.Even excluding the one-time gain and an after-tax charge of $395 million related to the impairment of some domestic oil and gas assets, Occidental earned $1.72 per share in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Net sales were flat at $6.17 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.67 per share on revenue of about $5.79 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""Occidental sold more than it produced,"" said Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov. ""It took volumes out of inventory, and that's why it beat estimates.""Los Angeles-based Occidental said output in the fourth quarter fell to 750,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) from 779,000 boe/d a year earlier. But sales volumes exceeded production due to the timing of shipments from the company's international operations, mainly in Iraq.Occidental said in October that it planned to sell a minority stake in its Middle East and North African operations, as well as announcing strategic alternatives for some assets in the U.S. Rocky Mountain region, which have lower returns.In the fourth quarter, Occidental also recorded a $665 million after-tax gain from the sale of part of its stake in the general partner of pipeline company Plains All American Pipeline LP.The company's realized price for U.S. crude in the fourth quarter rose to $94.52 per barrel, while worldwide crude gained 3 percent to $99.27 per barrel and domestic gas prices jumped 8 percent.Occidental's shares closed at $87.82 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.",2014-01-30,OXY,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 8:43am EST","UPDATE 1-Higher sales, oil prices boost Occidental profit",http://www.reuters.com//article/occidentalpetroleum-results-idUSL3N0L441320140130?type=companyNews

5,"  * Expects to complete spinoff by 2014-end or early 2015* To move headquarters to Houston from Los Angeles* Says unit will be state's largest natural gas producer* Says Chazen asked to remain president, CEO through 2016* Shares up 3 pct in late morning tradingBy Swetha GopinathFeb 14 Occidental Petroleum Corp said it would spin off its oil and gas assets in California into a separately traded company and move its headquarters from Los Angeles to Houston, where it will be closer to its largest U.S. operations.Wall Street analysts have estimated the underperforming California unit, which Occidental had talked about splitting from for months, could be worth $19 billion to $22 billion.New York-traded shares of Occidental rose 3.5 percent on Friday to $95.51, giving the fourth-largest U.S. oil company a market capitalization of $72 billion.Occidental said the California unit generated a pretax profit of about $1.5 billion in 2013.""Creating two separate energy companies will result in more focused businesses that will be competitive industry leaders,""  Chief Executive Stephen Chazen said on Friday.The California unit, the largest natural gas producer in the state, has long been seen as a drag on the company because of its limited oil production. Total production growth averaged 3.6 percent between 2010 and 2013. The California fields produced an average 261 million cubic feet of gas and 88,000 barrels of oil per day in 2013.Although natural gas prices have risen recently due to cold weather in North America, prices have been weak over the past few years because of a flood of production from shale fields.Occidental is increasingly focusing on production from fields in the Permian Basis in Texas and New Mexico, far from Los Angeles where the company was founded nearly a century ago.CALIFORNIA VS. TEXAS The formal migration of Occidental to Texas, a move Reuters flagged as likely late last year, follows several other departures from California to the Lone Star state by big companies in the energy industry. Texas Governor Rick Perry welcomed the shift, saying it was only fitting that the state's biggest oil producer should be based in ""the energy capital of the world.""Perry, a Republican, has run television ads in states that are traditional Democratic strongholds to lure companies to Texas, pitching it as a low-tax, low-regulation environment for ""creative renegades.""Fluor Corp, an engineering company now based outside Dallas, had called California's Orange County home until 2006. Calpine Corp, now a Houston-based power company, abandoned San Jose three years later.After Occidental's move, Chevron Corp. will be the only big oil company with headquarters in California. LESS PROPRIETARY TRADING The company has also said it will sell a minority stake in its Middle East and North Africa operations.""We are of the view that the Mid-East/North Africa monetization should be even more needle-moving... reflecting the fact that these assets are perceived by the market as particularly idiosyncratic,"" Raymond James analyst Pavel Molchanov said in an email.Occidental said it expected to complete the separation of the unit, which will likely carry debt of $4 billion to $5 billion, by the end of 2014 or early 2015.The California unit produces oil and gas on holdings covering 2.1 million net acres.Occidental also said on Friday that it would reduce proprietary trading in crude oil and other commodities, which analysts have said create volatility in quarterly earnings.The company did not say how this would affect Phibro, its proprietary business.U.S. oil and gas producers such as Hess Corp and Chesapeake Energy Corp are streamlining their operations and investing more in the most profitable shale fields in North America to increase shareholder returns.Occidental said on Thursday that it would sell $1.4 billion of natural gas assets in the central United States and use part of the funds to buy back another 30 million shares. The company also raised its dividend.The company said Chazen would remain president and CEO through 2016, extending his tenure by two years.It also said that Chairman Edward Djerejian, who was elected last May after the ousting of predecessor Ray Irani, had been asked to remain in the role for another year.",2014-02-14,OXY,"Fri Feb 14, 2014 | 1:22pm EST","UPDATE 4-Occidental to spin off California assets, move HQ to Houston",http://www.reuters.com//article/occidentalpetroleum-california-idUSL3N0LJ4CW20140214?type=companyNews

9,"   By Rory Carroll | SAN FRANCISCO, March 19  SAN FRANCISCO, March 19 The council of the Los Angeles County city of Carson, California, has unanimously approved a 45-day moratorium on new oil and gas drilling, a setback for Occidental Petroleum's plans to drill more than 200 new wells there and the latest example of local governments taking a stand against fracking.Occidental originally presented its plan to drill new wells in the Dominquez Oil Field in Carson in 2012. At the time it said it planned to use hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to reach an estimated 52 million barrels of oil trapped below ground in the area.Fracking consists of injecting water, sand and chemicals deep underground at high pressure to break apart rock and release oil and gas into a well. Its use has helped spur an energy boom across the United States.Occidental's plans were met with resistance from the Carson community, which voiced concern about the impact fracking could have on local air and water quality.When two test wells currently operating at the Dominquez project showed fracking would not effectively increase production, Occidental withdrew fracking from the project's scope, Occidental spokeswoman Susie Geiger said.Despite that, the city council approved the moratorium on new oil drilling by a vote of 5-0 late Tuesday to give city officials time to consider additional regulations. ""There are too many questions, too many unknowns and too many possible bad consequences that could result from the city engaging in this activity,"" said Albert Robles, the Carson council member who led the moratorium charge.""These questions significantly outweigh any possible benefit to the residents of Carson.""The city council will consider a one-year moratorium after the 45-day period is up, Robles said. Environmental groups, which held a rally outside city hall prior to Tuesday's vote, expressed concerns that Occidental would later decide to frack or use other controversial drilling techniques like acidization.They said they hope the moratorium will eventually lead to an outright ban on all new oil and gas production in Carson.Geiger said it was unclear what impact the moratorium would have on Occidental's plans for the project. She said the project would provide well-paying jobs and increased tax revenue for Carson, Los Angeles County and the state. The vote in Carson is the latest example of local governments moving to take a closer look at fracking after a bill that sought to bring the practice to a halt failed to pass the California state legislature last year. California Governor Jerry Brown has declined to impose a moratorium by executive order, angering many environmentalists in the state.The coastal city of Santa Cruz passed a fracking moratorium in September. Last month, the Los Angeles city council voted unanimously to prohibit fracking and other unconventional oil recovery practices at oil fields in the city. A final vote is required before it goes into effect.""California cities and counties have broad legal and moral authority to stop fracking at the local level,"" said Zack Malitz of progressive group Credo, which has helped organize scores of rallies against fracking in California.""If Governor Brown doesn't stand up to the fracking industry, he should expect a wave of local governments, under intense pressure from their constituents, to take action to protect residents from the toxic effects of fracking,"" he said.(Reporting by Rory Carroll; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)",2014-03-19,OXY,"Wed Mar 19, 2014 | 3:55pm EDT",California city halts new oil drilling over fracking concerns,http://www.reuters.com//article/california-fracking-idUSL2N0MG04020140319?type=companyNews

11,"  * Affected Vasconia volumes not seen significant* Gov't negotiating with indigenous community to repair pipe* U.S.'s Occidental suspends contractors until line reopens   (Adds details on attack, obstacles to repairs, background)By Peter Murphy and Luis Jaime AcostaBOGOTA, April 7 Colombia's state-run Ecopetrol SA has declared force majeure on a small number of deliveries of medium Vasconia crude after the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline was damaged by a series of attacks by leftist guerillas, a press official said on Monday.The official could not specify on what date force majeure was declared, what quantities were involved or which clients would be affected, but said volumes were not significant enough to require notifying the country's stock market regulator. The pipeline has been shut since a blast on March 25 in Toledo province, he said. Normally speedy repairs could not take place this time because of objections and demands made by an indigenous community near the site of the blast.Government and justice officials have intervened to seek a solution to the demands, which include diverting the pipeline away from their area, the Ecopetrol press official said. A separate bomb attack took place elsewhere in the same province on April 1, he said. Until repairs can begin, there is no estimate for when the 780 km (485 mile) pipeline, owned by Ecopetrol subsidiary Cenit, could reopen. It has capacity to transport 220,000 barrels per day.U.S.-based Occidental, which like Ecopetrol relies on the pipeline to pump oil to the Caribbean coast from the Cano Limon oil field, said in a statement on Monday that it had to suspend some contractors due to the pipeline's closure.A Colombia-based source at Occidental said the company had exhausted its storage capacity at the field, forcing it to suspend production. Workers would be able to return once the pipeline was operational, the source said. Occidental produced an average 29,000 barrels per day in 2013, according to data on its web site.Occidental is the operator of the Cano Limon field, where it  produces its own crude and also extracts the share belonging to partner Ecopetrol, meaning both have been immediately affected by the pipeline's closure.Bomb attacks on Colombia's pipelines increased in 2013 to 259, the highest in a decade and a 72 percent jump from 2012, according to Defense Ministry data. Leftist rebels say wealth generated in the sector benefits the foreign oil companies producing crude and not the local population.Oil is Colombia's most valuable export with around 1 million barrels per day produced in 2013, but finding new reserves to boost the 2.38 billion barrels available has become more urgent as production speeds up.

The company said reduced gas-directed drilling in the United States, field and port strikes in Libya and insurgent activity in Yemen weighed on total production.However, higher crude and natural gas prices in the United States helped Occidental make up for lower production. The company is also scaling back drilling for natural gas and focusing on drilling for the more lucrative crude oil.Occidental's realized price for U.S. crude rose 5 percent to $95.94 in the January-March quarter, while domestic gas prices jumped 15 percent. U.S. natural gas prices rose by about 50 percent in the quarter as harsh winter in North America sapped excess supplies at the key delivery point Henry Hub in Louisiana.The rise in natural gas prices helped U.S. oil companies Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips report first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. Occidental's net profit rose 2.6 percent to $1.39 billion, or $1.75 per share, in the quarter, while revenue rose nearly 4 percent to $6.09 billion.The results were above the average analysts' estimate of a profit of $1.70 per share and revenue of $5.87 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company said in October that it plans to sell a minority stake in its Middle East and North African operations, but is yet to announce a deal for the assets.Occidental is also spinning off its oil and gas assets in California into a publicly traded company and has shifted base from Los Angeles to Houston to be closer to its operations in the Permian Basis in Texas and New Mexico.Occidental's shares have risen about 4 percent in the last year to Friday's close of $94.44 on the New York Stock Exchange.

14,"  BOGOTA, July 2 Production at Occidental Petroleum Corp's oil fields in Colombia's northern Arauca province has been suspended following a rebel attack that left 13 people injured over the weekend, according to company and military sources.The U.S.-based oil company halted operations at two fields, Cano Limon and Caricare, which together produce around 67,000 barrels per day, and informed the government they will remain shut until security is guaranteed, both sources said.The attack, on a worker rest area at the Cano Limon oil field, was carried out by the leftist National Liberation Army, ELN, the government has said. Such attacks are unusual as rebels usually target pipelines and oil wells, not workers.The two sources asked that they not be identified. The government, which is in preliminary peace talks with the ELN, has offered a reward for each captured rebel.Energy Minister Amylkar Acosta said on Wednesday the government would double the number of troops in the area and provide ""all the security required"" to tackle rebels in the area. ""We have sent an important contingent of troops to guarantee the continuance of operations,"" Amylkar said.A religious service was taking place in the rest area when the attack happened on Sunday, the government has said. Colombia is Latin America's fourth-biggest oil producer with daily output of around 1 million barrels. Bomb attacks on oil infrastructure by the country's leftist guerrillas are frequent, with around five per week on average in 2013.Occidental is the operator of the Cano Limon field, where it produces its own crude and also extracts the share belonging to its partner, state-run Ecopetrol. In April, the company suspended labor contracts as a result of rebel attacks on the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, which was closed for two months after being blown up at several points by rebels, forcing the company to halt production at the fields.Attacks on Colombia's pipelines roe in 2013 to 259, the highest in a decade and a 72 percent increase from 2012, Defense Ministry data shows.Rebels say wealth generated in the sector benefits the foreign oil companies producing crude and not the local population.Output has slipped this year due to rebel attacks.

Hall's Astenbeck returned the most this year from among nine commodity funds that Maryland's $44 billion state pension system was invested in, data obtained by Reuters showed.The Astenbeck Commodities Fund III, which Maryland had about $137 million in, rose 19.1 percent through June. Astenbeck Capital said in a letter to its investors last month, also seen by Reuters, that it managed about $3.4 billion in different hedge fund accounts, each reporting similar returns.If Astenbeck maintains its near 20 percent gain through the year end, it will be its best annual performance since 2009, when it rose more than 28 percent. The fund, launched in 2008, posted losses in two of the last three years. Hall, who mostly takes bullish long-term bets on oil but also invests in natural gas, platinum and corn, managed to outperform despite range-bound oil markets.

22,"  Oct 7 Any sale of Occidental Petroleum Corp's  roughly 330,000 acres in North Dakota's oil-rich Bakken shale formation would make strategic sense for the company, which is likely eager to strike a deal, two analysts said on Tuesday.Oxy is looking to sell its Bakken holdings, which are largely undeveloped, for as much as $3 billion, according to a report from Bloomberg News.Even with the recent dip in crude oil prices, the divestment ""makes sense to us, strategically,"" Raymond James analysts Pavel Molchanov and Kevin Smith said in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""This is substantially undeveloped acreage, and Occidental has long cited it as a likely monetization candidate, so it's been puzzling why the company kept it this long,"" the analysts said. Oxy is spending about $510 million this year on its North Dakota holdings, and any buyer would have to invest significant capital to boost production. Currently, Oxy is the 18th-largest oil producer in North Dakota with about 17,000 barrels per day as of July, trailing peers of the same size and even much-smaller rivals. Oxy said last October that it would pursue ""strategic alternatives"" for some of its North American assets, including those in North Dakota.

23,"   By Mariana Santibanez  NEW YORK, Oct 7 (IFR) - Energy companies have become a larger presence in the US high-yield bond market this year, relying on debt to fund capex as they expand exploration and production activity, but months of heavy issuance and weaker oil prices are taking their toll.Some recent bond deals have struggled to get across the line, only to end up still getting punished in secondary.Apollo's US$1.1bn LBO bond for Jupiter Resources, for example, has traded as low as 89 - even after coming to market last month with a five-point discount.""A lot of high-yield energy companies, particularly those developing shale plays, are spending more money than they are taking in,"" Patrick Faul, head of research at Calvert Investments, told IFR.""They have to borrow capital to fund their planned development of the fields,"" said Faul, adding that most do not have the ability to use internally generated cash flow.In the race to develop shale fields, the industry overall has increased E&P spending in 2014 around 6%-8% year-on-year, according to Western Asset Management Co - and much of that is funded with high-yield paper.WAMCO said energy borrowers have already accounted for 19% of high-yield debt printed this year, well up from 13.8% for the whole of 2013.In September alone, energy and power made up 25.75% of total issuance, SDC data shows.""We've seen so much supply from E&P companies,"" said one high-yield investor. ""(It) is sending a bit of a red flag.""MORE DILIGENCE  Yet it's more than just the sheer volume of deals that is rattling nerves on the buy-side.Stalling demand from China has fuelled a steep drop in commodity prices. The WTI crude future for November has dropped to 89.40 from the 100.07 on July 25.The investor said he is skeptical about the E&P sector's business model overall, raising concerns that access to debt capital markets might get tougher for some borrowers.""They know they will have to come back to the debt markets to finance capex plans, but there is a risk that when energy prices fall, they cannot access the market,"" he said.Perhaps the most glaring example of that is Energy Future Holdings, the former TXU, which was taken private in 2007 in what was then the biggest leveraged buyout ever.The company's fortunes reversed suddenly when natural gas prices plummeted. It filed for bankruptcy this year, and investors figure to recover little from the restructuring. Bankers say the buy-side is also now paying more attention to the capital structure of deals, as well as details about ownership and areas targeted by the E&P activity they fund.Apollo's Jupiter bond, for example, was pulled out of the market in August after being met with investor push-back over what were seen as overly aggressive terms.When the trade was resurrected the following month, its covenants were changed, and it was downsized - meaning Apollo had to pump in more equity.It also came with a juicier 9.25% coupon, almost 200bp wider than 7.50% area whispers.""The restrictive covenants in the preliminary terms for the bonds (allowed for) significant debt that can be secured ahead of these bonds,"" said Anthony Canale, head of high-yield research at Covenant Review. Another market source said investors were ""particularly concerned"" about that issuer's flexibility to add more debt. He referenced the poor performance of unsecured bonds issued by sector rival Samson Resources, owned by KKR, when it piled on more debt.CARRYING ON Energy bonds were the second-worst performing high-yield sector in September, down about 2.24%, according to Citi. Naturally, that has had an impact on new issues.California Resources, which came to market the same week in September as Jupiter, priced its US$5bn trade three-tranche bond at the wide end of talk as investors demanded a premium for the big size of the deal and the area it operates in.The bond financed the spin-off of the business from Occidental Petroleum Corp.""It's not the Permian basin and, because of the spin-off, its area is limited to California. As a result it needed to pay more,"" said the market source.But the trade wasn't a disaster. It may have cost the company a bit more, but it still attracted an US$8bn order book.Bankers are now looking ahead to a similarly sized issue for Single B rated Dynegy, tipped to come to market in the next few weeks to partly finance its acquisition of coal and plants from Duke Energy and Energy Capital Partners (ECP).CreditSights is positive on the new Dynegy issue, despite investor worries it will re-price the company's outstanding curve and broader concerns about softer prices.""The biggest risk to Dynegy remains weak natural gas prices and a potential drop into the low US$3s,"" CreditSights said, ""but this (M&A) deal gives the company more fuel source diversity.""

ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N) on Thursday slashed exploration spending plans for this year, as the third- and fourth-largest U.S. oil companies attempt to cope with a steep slide in crude prices.The cuts follow similar steps by rival Hess Corp (HES.N) earlier this week while Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Europe's largest oil company, said on Thursday it would reduce its spending the next three years by $15 billion.  Rising supplies of oil, from sources including North American shale basins, and weakening demand have flooded global markets with crude, sending prices plummeting almost 60 percent since June. On Thursday, crude traded in New York at $43.80 per barrel, much lower than many oil and gas projects require to make money.In response to the price collapse, oil and gas companies have made drastic cuts to budgets, idled drilling rigs and in some cases, cut jobs.For a factbox on capex cuts, click on:Conoco, which said in December it would cut 2015 spending by 20 percent to $13.5 billion, now expects spending to be scaled back by a further 15 percent to $11.5 billion. Occidental said it would slash its capital budget by 33 percent to $5.8 billion this year.""There's a lot of debate right now about the duration of the current low oil prices. But we're assuming that they will stay low for 2015 and we're taking decisive actions accordingly,"" Ryan Lance, Conoco's CEO, said on a conference call.  U.S. PRODUCTION DIP? Conoco's second trimming of its 2015 capex budget raised the specter that others in the industry could further reduce their own spending, potentially reinforcing a dip in U.S. production that the U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts to occur this summer. That would mark a sharp turnabout for the U.S. oil industry, which has enjoyed five years of blistering output growth thanks to the shale oil boom. Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil producer, has yet to unveil 2015 spending and may do so on Friday when it reports quarterly results.  Conoco said it would defer drilling some U.S. onshore exploration programs and delay spending on some major projects. Occidental said it will pull back spending in North Dakota's Bakken Shale and in Bahrain. ""We think it is imprudent to accelerate some of these opportunities in the current low product price environment,"" Occidental Chief Executive Stephen Chazen told investors.Analysts at Houston-based investment bank Simmons & Co said Conoco's plan to further reduce capital spending is the right move to make, in this ""challenging environment.""Neither Conoco nor Occidental are running out of cash, despite the low prices, though. Indeed, Occidental last quarter spent $1.3 billion on 100,000 acres in the Permian, a prolific shale formation in Texas. Chazen said the deal was to better connect existing acreage and boost drilling efficiencies. Both companies also expect oil and gas output to rise this year, although possibly at a slower rate. Conoco now expects oil and gas output to grow 2 percent to 3 percent. That compares with a previous forecast for growth of 3 percent. Occidental said its production will ramp up 6 percent to 10 percent, helped by wells in the Permian Basin.Excluding one-time items, both companies reported earnings that topped analyst expectations. Conoco was helped by better-than-expected results in its Asia Pacific and Middle East segment, while Occidental's adjusted earnings were lifted by its chemicals business.On a net basis, both companies reported a quarterly loss.Conoco had a fourth-quarter loss of $39 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with a profit of $2.5 billion, or $2.00 a per share. One time-items including the termination of the Freeport LNG agreement. Occidental reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $3.41 billion, or $4.41 per share. It earned an income of $1.6 billion, or $2.04 a share, a year earlier.In afternoon trading Thursday, shares of Conoco fell about 1 percent to $61.90 per share, while shares of Oxy rose 1 percent to $77.30.

Occidental said it will pull back spending in North Dakota's Bakken Shale and in Bahrain.""We think it is imprudent to accelerate some of these opportunities in the current low product price environment,"" Occidental Chief Executive Stephen Chazen told investors.Analysts at Houston-based investment bank Simmons & Co said Conoco's plan to further reduce capital spending is the right move to make, in this ""challenging environment."" Neither Conoco nor Occidental are running out of cash, despite the low prices, though. Indeed, Occidental last quarter spent $1.3 billion on 100,000 acres in the Permian, a prolific shale formation in Texas. Chazen said the deal was to better connect existing acreage and boost drilling efficiencies.Both companies also expect oil and gas output to rise this year, although possibly at a slower rate. Conoco now expects oil and gas output to grow 2 percent to 3 percent. That compares with a previous forecast for growth of 3 percent.Occidental said its production will ramp up 6 percent to 10 percent, helped by wells in the Permian Basin.Excluding one-time items, both companies reported earnings that topped analyst expectations. Conoco was helped by better-than-expected results in its Asia Pacific and Middle East segment, while Occidental's adjusted earnings were lifted by its chemicals business.On a net basis, both companies reported a quarterly loss.Conoco had a fourth-quarter loss of $39 million, or 3 cents per share, compared with a profit of $2.5 billion, or $2.00 a per share. One time-items including the termination of the Freeport LNG agreement.Occidental reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $3.41 billion, or $4.41 per share.

On Thursday, crude traded in New York at around $44 a barrel, much lower than many oil and gas projects require to make money.In response to the price collapse, oil and gas companies have made drastic cuts to budgets, idled drilling rigs, and in some cases, cut jobs.ConocoPhillips, which said in December it would cut 2015 spending by 20 percent to $13.5 billion, now expects spending to be scaled back even further - by 15 percent to $11.5 billion.

51,"   By Edward McAllister | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Two weeks of thin declines in the U.S. rig count have raised expectations that drilling activity is nearing a pivotal level that could dent production, bolster prices and coax idle rigs back to the field after a precipitous cull since October.Energy producers responded quickly to a steep drop in oil prices over the last six months, idling nearly 800 rigs, or 50 percent, since a peak of 1,609 rigs in October. In the last week of January, rigs fell by 94, the biggest drop on record, according to a weekly survey by oil service firm Baker Hughes. [RIG/U]U.S. companies remain nervous about oil prices. Spending has been cut as prices fail to rebound significantly, and further price drops could quickly lead to more shrinkage in the rig count. But the decline has slowed, dropping by just 23 rigs in the last two weeks, the smallest weekly cuts since December, according to the latest survey released on Thursday, a sign that the rig count could be approaching its low point. Some reckon that a 50-60 percent drop is as far as it will fall, once energy firms remove their least efficient rigs.""Production companies are in a holding pattern for now,"" said Eric Lee, analyst at Citi in New York. ""It could be the beginning of the flattening of the decline in the rig count.""The U.S. rig count is vital for global oil markets that have been flooded with oversupply this year, but it has proven a conundrum for traders and analysts.  U.S. oil output remains strong and continues to contribute to the global glut, despite the drop in rigs, in part because it takes time for a decline in drilling to hit production levels, but also because rigs are more efficient now than even a year ago.U.S. drillers were forced to scale back after oil prices fell 60 percent to near $40 a barrel in January, from more than  $100 a barrel last June. The rig count fell by 11 to 802 this week, according to the latest Baker Hughes survey, the lowest number since 2011.     ""We think 1,000-1,200 rigs will keep production steady. With 800 rigs, we should see production decline in the second half of the year,"" said Francisco Blanch, analyst at Bank of America. ""We might see a little more rigs lost, but the majority of the fall is behind us."" According to Baker Hughes, oil rigs in the Permian Basin of Texas, one of the country's largest oil deposits, fell this week to 280, the lowest level since basin-by-basin records began in early 2011 and down from over 560 in November. In the Williston Basin of North Dakota, oil rigs are at 91, also the lowest since 2011, down from nearly 200 in November. In both regions, however, the decline has eased.  The decline scenario was unthinkable six months ago when oil was at $90 a barrel and the oil production boom showed little sign of abating, despite a drop from $107 in June. It remains to be seen how production will be impacted or whether a lower rig count will help reduce the growing U.S. crude stockpile that is causing jitters in the market.   ""We have seen an awful lot of damage and the consequences for production will be manifested in months rather than quarters,"" said William Herbert, managing director at Simmons & Company International investment bank in Houston. Herbert expects the rig count to fall by about another 100 rigs before bottoming out at the end of June.

53,"  ABU DHABI, April 20 Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) does not have a deadline for when to award further stakes in its 40-year onshore oilfield concession, the director general of the state run company said on Monday.The comment suggests ADNOC, which signed an agreement on Jan. 29 with France's Total giving the firm a 10 percent stake in the new concession, is in no rush to make a decision about other bidders in the tender.Total's bid set the bar high for peers like BP and Royal Dutch Shell after the French oil major submitted the best bid and highest signature bonus, according to industry sources.When asked if talks with Shell and BP continued after they submitted revised bids, ADNOC's director general Abdullah Nasser al-Suwaidi told reporters in Abu Dhabi that the oil companies ""know what we've asked for and they bid."" ""Whoever meets our conditions, will be considered... there is no timeline,"" he added.A total of nine firms bid for stakes in the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations (ADCO) concession which became available after a 40-year deal with Western oil companies expired in January 2014. ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and BP each held 9.5 percent equity stakes in that ADCO concession. After the deal expired last year, ADNOC took 100 percent of the concession as political leaders in Abu Dhabi weighed up whether to bring in Asian firms, industry and diplomatic sources said.Shell, Total and BP made new bids, while Exxon decided against bidding.Other bidders include U.S. firm Occidental Petroleum Corp , Italy's ENI, China National Petroleum Corp.

54,"  (Recasts lead, adds detail, background)By Yuka Obayashi and Rania El GamalTOKYO/ABU DHABI, April 27 Japan's Inpex Corp  became the first Asian oil company to get a stake in a new 40-year onshore oil concession in Abu Dhabi, joining France's Total in developing the United Arab Emirates' (UAE) biggest oilfields.Nine Asian and Western companies bid for stakes in the Abu Dhabi Company for Onshore Oil Operations (ADCO) concession after a deal with the Western majors dating back to the 1970s expired in January 2014.Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) said on Monday it had granted Inpex a 5 percent stake in the new concession.The fields produce 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) and output is expected to rise to 1.8 million from 2017.Total became the first oil major to renew the concession, putting peers under pressure to improve terms after the local partner said the French firm made the best offer.Last week, ADNOC's director general said there was no deadline for awarding further stakes in the concession, suggesting Abu Dhabi was in no rush to make a decision about other bidders in the tender. The Inpex concession gives Japan, which imports almost all of its oil and is the fourth-biggest importer, the ability to procure oil without passing through the chokepoint of the Strait of Hormuz at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Yoichi Miyazawa told reporters.""This is an epoch-making event and this pact will contribute greatly to Japan's stable procurement of oil,"" Miyazawa said.It is the first major stake in an oil concession Japan has obtained since 2009. Japan holds stakes in oilfields producing 610,000 bpd and the ADCO concession will boost the figure by 15 percent when production is expanded to 1.8 million bpd.Inpex did not disclose the value of the deal due to a confidentiality agreement, but Japanese public broadcaster NHK said earlier it was expected to be worth $1.1 billion. Other bidders for the concessions include Occidental Petroleum Corp, Italy's ENI, China National Petroleum Corp, Norway's Statoil and Korea National Oil Corp.The concession signed with Total was effective from Jan. 1, 2015, and covers Abu Dhabi's 15 principal onshore oilfields that represent more than half of the Gulf emirate's production.Four oil majors -- ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell , Total and BP -- had each held 9.5 percent equity stakes in the ADCO concession since the 1970s. After the deal expired last year, state-run ADNOC took 100 percent of the concession as political leaders in Abu Dhabi weighed up whether to bring in Asian firms or stick with old partners, industry and diplomatic sources said.Shell and BP have also put in new bids, while Exxon has decided against bidding, sources have told Reuters.For Japan, which imported 3.45 million bpd of oil in 2014, the UAE accounted for about 24 percent of the supply.Inpex also owns a stake in the ADNOC's offshore oil concession, which is set to expire in 2018.Japan's next challenge is to win a renewal of that stake.""The deal on the onshore oil fields underlines a sense of trust in Japan by Abu Dhabi and could add momentum to our negotiation for the offshore concession,"" Ryo Minami, director at the oil and gas division at Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, told reporters.Japan, which aims to boost self-sufficiency in gas and oil to 40 percent by the 2030 fiscal year, will raise the ratio to near 25 percent with the latest deal from 23.3 percent in the 2013/14 year.

56,"   By Robert Gibbons | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oil prices eased off 2015 highs on Friday after Iraq said its crude oil exports hit a record in April, and on pressure from a stronger dollar.Both Brent and U.S. crude settled well above intraday lows, supported by data showing another slip in drilling rig activity and news of a shut gasoline-making unit in Venezuela.Venezuela's 645,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Amuay refinery has halted its catalytic cracking unit for maintenance, helping U.S. RBOB gasoline RBc1 and ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) HOc1 futures post higher settlements on the first day of trading with June contracts in front-month position.June Brent LCOc1 crude fell 32 cents to settle at $66.46 a barrel, after falling to $65.52 and having earlier matched Thursday's 2015 peak of $66.93. Brent jumped 21 percent in April.U.S. June crude CLc1 fell 48 cents to settle at $59.15, after hitting a 2015 high of $59.90 and recovering from a $58.32 intraday low. U.S. crude futures gained 25 percent last month.Trading volume was thinned as some major markets were closed for the May Day holiday.    Friday's pullback was initially sparked by news that Iraq's oil exports rose in April to a record 3.08 million bpd from 2.98 million bpd in March, which served as a reminder of ample supply in the market.OPEC supply in April rose to its highest in more than two years at 31.04 million bpd, according to a Reuters survey.    ""What is driving prices these days is less physical markets, which remain very weak, but more expectations of future tightening,"" said Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at Energy Aspects.Despite a sharp drop in U.S. shale drilling in recent months, there have been few signs that a global supply glut is easing. Oil services firm Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) said on Friday that U.S. drilling activity fell by 24 rigs, fewer than the 31 rigs idled last week.""If markets don't tighten as quickly as people are expecting, the sell-off can be large,"" Sen said.The U.S. dollar index .DXY posted its best daily gain in a month, up from a two-month low on signs that the U.S. economy may be stabilizing after a soft patch. The stronger dollar helped pressure several dollar-denominated commodities, including oil. .TRJCRB Speculators cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in the week to April 28, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday.

63,"   By Barani Krishnan and Robert Gibbons | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Brent oil posted its first weekly loss in a month on Friday as the market fretted again about global oversupply while U.S. crude rose for an eighth straight week, helped by jobs growth data and the first storm of the hurricane season forming.Crude prices had rallied with little pause over the past month, helped by a weaker dollar and bets that better demand in the near term will ease the supply glut.But on Thursday, prices fell as much as 3 percent, their most since early April, after hitting 2015 highs. Oil was also pressured by a stronger dollar and physical oil markets showing tens millions of West African, Azeri and North Sea crude barrels without buyers.In Friday's session, Brent, the more globally-used benchmark for oil, settled down 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $65.39 a barrel. It was down 1.6 percent on the week. Brent had risen previously in four consecutive weeks, gaining nearly 20 percent.U.S. crude rose 45 cents, or 0.8 percent, for the session to settle at $59.39 a barrel. It climbed 0.4 percent on the week, extending gains for an eighth straight week that had put the market up 32 percent. Some analysts doubted the market could press on without correction.""We can see some downside acceleration next week and we are leaving a $40 price handle on the table,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois.Brent slipped after early support from record high crude imports in China in April. Traders cautioned that low prices could encourage China to stockpile, adding to global inventories. Trading also turned choppy on the realization that last week's drawdown in U.S. inventories was at the expense of builds in gasoline and distillates. [EIA/S]""Products inventories were up, so it looks like the crude is just being turned into products"" without corresponding demand, said Dominick Chirichella, senior partner at the Energy Management Institute in New York. Still, U.S. crude sidestepped those concerns to rise on higher nonfarm payrolls in April.Also supportive to the market was news that Ana, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season which traditionally begins June 1, had formed off the coast of South Carolina..U.S. crude also stayed resilient despite this week's drop in the country's oil rig count, a measure for future output, being the smallest in a month.

64,"  Goldman Sachs has cut its long-term crude oil price forecasts and recommended investors sell shares in two major oil companies, saying that improved U.S. shale efficiency and higher production from OPEC will more than cover future demand.The U.S. investment bank's equities team, in a note published on Saturday, raised its projection for the average Brent crude oil LCOc1 price this year to $58 a barrel from $52 and lifted its outlook for U.S. light crude futures CLc1 to $52 a barrel from $48.But Goldman, closely followed investors including large pensions and hedge funds, said it expects Brent to fall over time, reaching $55 a barrel by 2020.Brent traded around $67 a barrel at 1100 GMT on Monday.""We lower our Brent oil price assumption to $60-$65 for 2016-2019, falling to $55 for 2020,"" Goldman said.""We see global oil demand being met by U.S. shale, which is continuing to benefit from efficiency and productivity improvements, and OPEC,"" the bank's note to clients added.Goldman said that this ""lower-for-longer oil price"" would ""put significant pressure"" on integrated oil companies, forcing a rethink on dividends.""As a result, we downgrade the sector outlook to 'cautious' from 'neutral',"" it said. The bank downgraded BP (BP.L) and Statoil (STL.OL) to ""sell"" from ""neutral"", citing long-term dividend risk for BP and cashflow pressure on Statoil.Last week the U.S. investment bank described a recent rally in oil prices was ""premature"", adding that a weakening of prices is required for a rebalancing of the market to resume. Oil prices have recovered this year after sharp falls through the second half of 2014.Goldman Sachs said it assumed a $5 a barrel spread between Brent and U.S. crude, which is also known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), through 2016-2020.To view a list of the forecast changes, click (Reporting by Anupam Chatterjee and Vijaykumar Vedala in Bengaluru and Christopher Johnson and Ron Bousso in London; Editing by David Goodman)",2015-05-18,OXY,"Mon May 18, 2015 | 8:04am EDT",Goldman cuts crude outlook and oil company forecasts,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-oil-forecast-goldman-idUSKBN0O30YG20150518?type=companyNews

68,"  (Refiles to correct bid to billion, not million in 19th paragraph)* Since 1993 China poured $140 bln into foreign energy projects* Acquisitions were $4.4 bln last year, lowest since 2008* Anti-graft campaign, crude slump hit appetite for deals* Chinese state firms shift to cutting costs, selling assetsBy Chen AizhuBEIJING, Aug 7 As global oil giants struggle with plunging earnings, Chinese state oil firms are unlikely to be waiting in the wings to buy any unwanted assets.After pouring tens of billions of dollars into foreign energy projects in the last two decades, China's rush to purchase overseas oil and gas projects is over - at least for now - and some state firms are even looking to sell assets.China, the world's second-biggest oil consumer, invested more than $140 billion in the sector in the period from 1993, according to Thomson Reuters data.But Chinese firms have slammed the brakes on after a slide in crude prices has slashed returns on some investments and with deals coming under greater scrutiny since Beijing stepped up an anti-graft campaign two years ago.The shift started last year but has become more pronounced in recent months, industry sources say, with the focus for management now on more mundane goals such as cutting costs and improving returns from assets rather than new purchases.""The era of rapid, sometimes blind, expansions is over,"" said Luo Zuoxian, an economist at a research arm of Sinopec Group, parent of Sinopec Corp, China's No.2 energy giant. Luo does not foresee any big acquisitions in the next three to five years.Sinopec, which in late 2013 surprised the market by putting up for sale some shale gas assets in Canada, may now look to offload more ""non-core"" assets, senior company sources said.Sinopec Group is also shaking up its global exploration unit and re-assessing its broader investment strategy to identify ""core areas"" for spending in future.This could mean that projects in places such as eastern Africa, which is rich in natural gas, could fall outside the targets, because to exploit them would require heavy spending and years to get returns, one of the sources said.Sinopec declined to comment on divestment plans. ANTI-GRAFT DRIVE Beijing's anti-graft drive, which has felled about a dozen top oil executives, has also made it harder to strike new deals.New chairmen have been appointed in May at the top three energy groups - China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) , parent of PetroChina, Sinopec and CNOOC, parent of CNOOC Ltd.""The anti-graft climate sends a message: 'to do less is safer'"", said an investment official at a state oil firm.China's graft watchdog said in April that some of Sinopec's overseas investments had generated low returns or even no revenue after years of output.""It's definitely a dialing back of what they want to achieve. Previously it was growth at all cost, now the mantra is return on value,"" said Neil Beveridge of Bernstein Research. In a bid to cut spending, CNPC said last week it has started renegotiation with contractors on 24 overseas projects including gas ventures in Russia and Mozambique.HIGHS AND LOWS Thomson Reuters data showed outbound oil and gas deals were $4.4 billion last year, the lowest since 2008.China has had highs and lows in investments going back.A decade ago, CNOOC pulled an $18.5 billion bid for U.S firm Unocal after intense opposition from Washington, though in 2013 it bought Canada's Nexen Inc for $15.1 billion, China's largest foreign acquisition.Asked about its strategy in a low oil price environment, CNOOC said it would prudently invest, balancing short-term return and long-term development and focusing on cash flow, as well as optimising assets and capital allocation.CNOOC sold several small conventional gas assets last year, and Sinochem Group pulled back its team of five from the Wolfcamp shale operation in Texas, company sources said.Sinopec's Argentine oil and gas venture, bought in 2010 from Occidental Petroleum Corp, could be considered for divestment, said a company source.But as China remains a top oil buyer, with imports of crude on two occasions exceeding that of the United States this year, some say it is only a matter of time before Chinese firms buy abroad again, albeit more cautiously.""Once the new management has settled down, the low interest rate environment in China together with stabilizing oil prices should improve the cash flow, enabling them to exploit opportunistic acquisitions overseas, perhaps starting 2017,"" said Gordon Kwan of Nomura research.

71,"   By Ernest Scheyder | WILLISTON, N.D.  WILLISTON, N.D. Oct 16 Occidental Petroleum Corp's move to sell its North Dakota acreage likely removes a logjam that had impeded U.S. oilfield deals for much of the year, though the deal's price sets an unusually low bar for future deals and gives buyers the advantage over sellers.Oxy is selling all of its roughly 300,000 acres in North Dakota's Bakken shale formation to a private equity fund in a deal valued around $500 million, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.The price is roughly one-sixth, though, of what Wall Street had expected Oxy to fetch for the assets as recently as last year.Houston-based Oxy did not sell the North Dakota assets out of distress; indeed, it has $2.8 billion in cash in the bank. Rather, the deal removes an operational distraction from managers focused elsewhere and helps the company achieve its goal of being cash-flow neutral. Still, for ConocoPhillips, Whiting Petroleum Corp , Oasis Petroleum Inc and other oil companies pursuing pipeline or oil acreage sales, Oxy has set the bar low.""The (Oxy) sale price shows the stark reality that operators trying to sell non-core acreage face in a sub-$50 per barrel oil world face,"" said Tim Rezvan, an oil industry analyst at Sterne Agee CRT.Conoco, one of the largest American oil producers, is trying to sell oil and gas properties in the Rockies, East Texas, South Texas and Northern Louisiana, with expectations for the total value of all the deals eclipsing $2 billion. As with Oxy, the deals would not be crucial to Conoco's survival, but would give the company cash to weather the low oil price storm and focus more on core operations.Yet with Oxy accepting far lower than Wall Street expected for its non-core acreage in North Dakota, it remains to be seen if Conoco can hit that target. Whiting and Oasis are currently selling so-called midstream assets mostly comprised of pipelines and saltwater disposal units.But the assets, which generate steady streams of cash, might now go for far less than executives want, which would be potentially harmful for these companies.In the case of Oasis, which operates only in North Dakota, the sale of all or part of its saltwater disposal business is seen as vital to keeping core oil operations online. Earlier this month Wall Street banks cut Oasis' credit line by roughly $170 million, the largest reported reduction this autumn of an oil producer's access to debt markets in the wake of plunging crude prices.That cut stressed the company's balance sheet and put further onus on a good price for the saltwater disposal assets, which at one time was estimated to be worth as much as $880 million.

96,"  QUITO Dec 22 The government of Ecuador obtained a discount of at least 18 percent on compensation required by a World Bank tribunal for seizing Occidental Petroleum Corp's  assets, President Rafael Correa said, adding that negotiations were ongoing.In 2012, the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) awarded Occidental $1.77 billion. An ICSID tribunal then cut the award by 40 percent in November and the negotiations appear to have reduced that amount by a further 18 percent.""We are negotiating very hard and have obtained a discount of at least 18 percent of the payment. This may increase,"" Correa said in the coastal province of Guayas.""But in truth we are going to pay 30 percent less,"" he added, explaining that the percentage includes some tax disputes and labor liabilities that Occidental has pending in the country. The discounts would come in addition to the 40 percent reduction announced earlier this year.Ecuador is requesting a ""comprehensive agreement"" to finalize all outstanding issues between the two parties. ""The oil company wants to impose a clause that leaves the door open to continue suing the country and that is unacceptable,"" said Correa. Reuters was not immediately able to obtain comment from Occidental.Ecuador seized the field known as Block 15 from Occidental in 2006, arguing that its sale to Andes Petroleum had been carried out without government consent.At the time of the contract termination, Occidental was Ecuador's largest oil investor, extracting around 100,000 barrels of oil per day.

""We're conscious that the award is enforceable, and if Ecuador doesn't honor it, even if we're right, it could be enforced,"" Garcia told television channel Ecuavisa, adding that the country would finish paying by April.

98,"   By Mike Stone and Jessica DiNapoli  Jan 25 SandRidge Energy Inc is exploring debt restructuring options, according to people familiar with the matter, as the heavily indebted U.S. oil and gas exploration and production company struggles with the fallout from plunging energy prices.SandRidge has been in talks with investment banks and law firms about hiring restructuring advisors, and could make an announcement on their appointment as early as this week, the people said.Debtwire had reported on Jan. 13, also citing unnamed sources, that SandRidge - which produces oil and gas from shale formations in the Mid-Continent region of the United States - had hired Houlihan Lokey to craft a restructuring plan. Houlihan Lokey is very likely to be named SandRidge's financial advisor for any restructuring, the Reuters sources said.These sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.SandRidge and Houlihan Lokey declined to comment.Oklahoma City-based SandRidge, which has a debt burden of around $4 billion, has already been reaching out to some of its creditors to inform them that they should work together to prepare for likely negotiations, one of the sources said.The vast majority of the company's debt is in the form of bonds owned by a plethora of mutual funds, hedge funds, and other institutional investors. They do not yet have a single representative who could be reached for comment.One of the options that the company will consider is a pre-packaged bankruptcy with the agreement of its creditors, the people said. They said that a decision on a way forward is not imminent and that the company has access to enough cash to continue doing business for at least several more months under its current structure.Other avenues SandRidge could pursue would include a debt exchange or filing for bankruptcy protection without any agreement with its creditors. It is not clear whether the company currently has a preference for a particular route. SETTLED DISPUTE As oil prices hover around 12-year lows, many U.S. oil and gas exploration and production companies are looking for ways to stay afloat. SandRidge, which made risky bets in the Mississippi Lime formation in northern Oklahoma and southern Kansas, is particularly vulnerable.For months, SandRidge has been caught in a bind, having just enough money to pay interest on its debt, but not enough to drill new wells or replace older ones.Mississippi Lime wells typically do not produce as much oil as some other shale formations, and the rock also contains a lot of water, which is costly to haul away.After an initially encouraging exploration phase, the shale play has not delivered the low cost production gains that SandRidge and Wall Street analysts expected. About 40 energy companies entered bankruptcy in 2015 and more are expected in the next few months as oil prices have dropped by 75 percent since mid-2014.The companies that filed last year include Swift Energy Co, which filed for bankruptcy on December 31, Magnum Hunter Resources Corp and Samson Resources Corp.SandRidge attracted the ire of Oklahoma regulators over its use of wells to dispose of wastewater, an activity that is believed to trigger earthquakes. Last week, the company agreed to shut seven wells in the state and reduce the amount of wastewater injected into roughly 40 others.On Friday, SandRidge said it had also settled a dispute stemming from a 30-year agreement to send Occidental Petroleum Corp a fixed amount of natural gas from the Pinon field in west Texas each year. Occidental had been treating the gas to extract carbon dioxide which it uses in its own oil recovery business and then sending methane back to SandRidge. However,  low natural gas prices have made it uneconomic for SandRidge to fulfill the contract and it faced potential penalties that could have eventually run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.Under the agreement, SandRidge will hand over the Pinon assets to Occidental plus $11 million in cash and Occidental will drop any claims from the previous deal. SandRidge said the settlement is expected to reduce its operating costs by $39 million in 2016. SHARES DELISTED To raise cash, SandRidge has put its headquarters in Oklahoma City up for sale in May, but has yet to find a buyer. In April, it laid off at least 130 employees, or 20 percent of its workforce based there, public records show. It has also previously used a distressed debt exchange with creditors to lighten its debt load.SandRidge had $790 million in cash and access to undrawn credit facilities that gave it access to capital totaling $1.9 billion, chief financial officer Julian Bott said on the company's latest quarterly earnings call on Nov. 5. This has given the company breathing room of several more months to decide on a way forward, as well as scope to pursue another debt exchange.As of earlier this month, SandRidge's shares are no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and trade on the OTC Pink marketplace instead with a market capitalization of around $30 million.Its bonds are trading at extremely distressed levels, with its Jan. 15 2020 notes at below 5 cents on the dollar.Oklahoma-based SandRidge was founded in 2006 by former CEO Tom Ward, a previous executive and co-founder of natural gas giant Chesapeake Energy Corp.Ward was ousted by SandRidge's board in 2013 after some of SandRidge's largest investors alleged governance lapses and strategic missteps, including transactions SandRidge had made with entities controlled by the Ward family. His exit package from the firm was worth around $90 million. A request for comment at Ward's new Oklahoma City-based company, Tapstone Energy, was not immediately returned.SandRidge named James Bennett as CEO in June of 2013.

104,"   By Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Feb 22 Oil and gas pipeline and processing companies that borrowed vast amounts to grow when crude oil prices were much higher and U.S. output was surging now face major issues over that leverage, the CEO of Occidental Petroleum Corp warned on Monday.During the plunge in crude oil prices, investors have punished exploration and production companies that had freely tapped capital markets for funds to drill new wells.Now, those same markets are penalizing pipeline companies formed as master limited partnerships (MLPs), which rely on growth to pay out rich dividends to investors in exchange for favorable tax treatment. ""If you think debt is bad in the production business, the midstream has a lot more relatively,"" Stephen Chazen, Occidental's chief executive told the IHS CERAWeek conference in Houston on Monday.Occidental does not have an MLP, a vehicle that soared in popularity when crude oil prices were much higher than those currently around $30 a barrel. ""They were counting on growth in production that for now is not there. So that's really a major issue for the midstream - trying to deal with way too much debt given the (dividend) promises made to limited holders.""He added that money would be tougher to come by.

106,"   By Jessica DiNapoli | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Highly-leveraged U.S. energy companies are struggling to carry out debt swaps as part of their survival strategy because plummeting oil and gas prices make investors either avoid such deals or demand tougher terms.Last year, at least 10 exploration and production companies, including California Resources Corp (CRC.N), managed to ease financial pressure by persuading investors to accept some losses on their bond holdings in return for new debt that often matures later and offers better collateral.Yet since prices tumbled further early this year, investors have grown more worried that some firms may not survive the rout. They see no point in accepting debt with potentially better collateral if it could mean nothing once the firm hits the wall.The deepening slump also means that producers need to offer more attractive terms - higher interest payments and more collateral - to win over investors and avoid the brutal equity wipeout that happens in most bankruptcies.""Investors are less desperate now since they've already taken a lot of the pain,"" said Roopesh Shah, global chief of Goldman Sachs' restructuring group.""They have less downside they're trying to protect,"" he said. Shah said debt exchanges were still viable, but needed to offer better protection and potential gains for investors. That is a tall order for producers, which must conserve cash to make it through the price slump, and whose ability to issue new debt is limited by provisions in bond documents that tie debt to commodity prices.Pennsylvania-based Eclipse Resources Corp (ECR.N) that acquires and develops oil and natural gas properties in Ohio, canceled a debt exchange launched in January. Denbury Resources Inc (DNR.N), a Texas company with operations in the Rocky Mountains and along the Gulf of Mexico Coast, pulled a debt swap even after sweetening the deal for investors.  ""Ultimately we terminated because it wasn't attractive enough for us,"" said Denbury spokesman Ross Campbell, adding that the company is still deciding whether to try another swap. Eclipse declined to comment.Chesapeake Energy Corp's (CHK.N) and Vanguard Natural Resources LLC's (VNR.O) exchange offers saw limited demand. Only about 20 percent of holders of Chesapeake bonds due in 2017 and 2018 took up the offer, even after Chesapeake doubled the amount of new debt it planned to issue. About 30 percent of eligible potential bondholders took part in Vanguard's exchange. The companies did not respond to requests for comment. LOOMING BANKRUPTCIES  With survival options dwindling, Roughly a third of U.S. oil producers, or 175 firms, is at risk of slipping into bankruptcy this year, according to a study by Deloitte, the auditing and consulting firm. About 40 hit the wall last year. The deepening downturn has jeopardized other survival strategies, including selling assets to raise cash or buying back debt.     When California Resources, a spin-off of Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), launched its debt exchange in November, it offered creditors 80 percent of face value - a premium of 11 to 23 percent - plus a hefty bump in interest rate. The company, which declined to comment, more than doubled the total amount of old debt investors could trade in.  In its canceled exchange, Eclipse Resources offered investors half of face value for bonds that had already cratered to 30 cents on the dollar, and a virtually unchanged coupon on the proposed new bonds. Some swaps turned out to be disastrous for debtholders, which may be deterring others. New debt issued by Halcon Resources Corp (HK.N) in an exchange now trades below 15 cents on the dollar, after the exploration and production company completed another swap that offered investors higher security. The new California Resources debt has also plummeted, to close to 20 cents on the dollar. As the crisis ripples through the energy sector, larger companies will also consider debt exchanges, until now mainly pursued by small producers, bankers said. At least two firms are now seeking debt swaps. Rex Energy Corp (REXX.O) offers its creditors higher coupon and a second lien debt that comes ahead of unsecured debt plus equity for their holdings. Alta Mesa Holdings LP [ALMEH.UL] proposes to swap bonds for secured term loans. Rex declined to comment, and Alta Mesa did not respond to requests for comment.Swaps are not a silver bullet for issuers either. Linn Energy LLC LINE.O, whose bondholders agreed to an exchange last year, drew down a revolving credit line this year, a sign of potential trouble ahead. The company did not immediately return a request for comment.

107,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK After several false starts over the last two years, U.S. fund managers are betting that energy stocks have finally hit bottom. Firms including T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and American Funds have been adding shares of exploration and production companies that they say have the most to gain from oil prices stabilizing. The price of oil fell from $115 a barrel to $27.88 between June 2014 and January of this year, yet is up more than 50 percent since hitting its low. The number of funds buying shares of ConocoPhillips jumped 144 percent over the last three months compared with the previous quarter, according to data from fund tracker Morningstar. Occidental Petroleum Corp, meanwhile, had a 110 percent increase in new owners.""The E&P companies have taken the brunt of the pain that I think they will see in their business, so they will go into recovery faster and first,"" said Bill Costello, a portfolio manager at Westwood who has been adding to his exposure of the sector. Some companies in the sector, such as Marathon Oil Corp and Devon Energy Corp have plugged holes in their balance sheets by selling assets and offering additional equity shares to investors, he said, allowing them to withstand a prolonged era of relatively low oil prices.  The rush of fund managers to buy exploration and production companies after several quarters of shedding them is one reason why the sector is up 9 percent for the year to date, outpacing both the 6.3 percent gain for energy stocks as a whole and the 1.8 percent gain in the broad Standard & Poor's 500. Overall, energy stocks remain the most underweight sector among fund mangers, with the average large cap fund holding approximately 1 percent less of its portfolio in the sector than its weight in the benchmark index, according to Lipper data.Fund managers say that they are buying exploration and production companies in part because they expect the oil glut to dwindle this year as production halts begin to take effect, setting up for a rally in revenue and earnings in 2017. ""If you stop being negative on energy, you don't want to buy a safe energy play, you want to buy a levered play,"" said Ernesto Ramos, a portfolio manager at BMO Asset Management Company, referring to EOG Resources, whose revenues are closely tied to oil prices. Shares of the company are up 6.7 percent for the year to date, roughly half of the 14.6 percent increase in oil over the same time. Overall, earnings among energy companies in the S&P 500 are expected to fall 66.5 percent in 2016, before gaining 203.1 percent in 2017, according to Thomson Reuters data.  The prospects of a revenue and earnings rebound over the next two years is attracting growth-focused fund managers who have typically shied away from the energy sector. Mike Pytosh, portfolio manager of the Voya MidCap Opportunities fund, said that he shifted his energy exposure during the January and February sell-off from refineries to exploration and production companies that were the hardest hit. ""It certainly got to a point where it was oversold. You have to not look at where the expectations are now, but where these companies will be a year or two out,"" he said.
