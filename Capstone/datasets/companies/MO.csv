0,"  Feb 5 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)E-cigarettes provide tobacco companies with a  compelling source of diversification and the potential to reverse secular  declines over the long term, Fitch Ratings says. Altria's recently announced  acquisition of E-cigarette company Green Smoke highlights the industry's  commitment to this promising product category.Altria Tuesday said its Nu Mark LLC subsidiary would acquire Green Smoke Inc.'s  E-vapor business for approximately $110 million in a transaction expected to  close during the second quarter. Green Smoke's offering is differentiated from  NuMark's MarkTen E-cigarette brand by in the vapor itself, which is delivered in  a higher volume. Green Smoke has limited distribution capability as its products  are mainly sold via the Internet. Altria's much larger retail channel can now  offer an E-cigarette portfolio combining the relatively new MarkTen brand with  the highly rated Green Smoke products. The entrance of large tobacco companies has legitimized the E-cigarette  marketplace. Lorillard, the first major tobacco company to jump into the space  with the purchase of blu eCigs in April 2012, has since committed to rapidly  expanding the number of retail outlets for the blu brand. British American  Tobacco acquired     Ltd in 2012. Shortly thereafter, Altria and  Reynolds American introduced their MarkTen and Vuse e-cigarette brands,  respectively. Growth prospects for the E-cigarette industry are compelling, with sales  estimates for the U.S. marketplace reaching $1.5 billion in 2013, compared to  less than $10 million in 2007. Demand has essentially doubled every year since  the introduction of the vapor products in late 2006 in the US, which is the  world's largest E-cigarette marketplace. The vast majority of this demand is  derived from current tobacco smokers.The consistent, rapid growth of the industry has led to predictions that  E-cigarette sales will overtake those generated by tobacco cigarettes within the  next decade. Today, the size of the E-cigarette category pales in comparison to  that of the overall tobacco industry, estimated at $697 billion in global retail  value in 2012 by Euromonitor international. While promising, growth via the nascent E-cigarette product category could be  stifled under potentially strict government regulation. The U.S. Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) may soon regulate E-cigarettes, which are currently  unregulated as either a tobacco product or a smoking cessation medical device.  The FDA wants to address concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of the vapor  cigarettes as well as the potential influence of their use on youth smoking  initiation.For more information on this topic, please see our special report titled,  ""E-Cigarettes: A Glowing Marketplace,"" available on our Website  www.fitchratings.com",2014-02-05,MO,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 9:32am EST",RPT-Fitch: Altria Green Smoke Buy Highlights Industry e-Cig Interest,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-altria-green-smoke-buy-highlights-idUSFit68990920140205?type=companyNews
1,"   By Jonathan Stempel  An Illinois state appeals court has reinstated a $10.1 billion verdict against Philip Morris USA in a lawsuit accusing the Altria Group Inc unit of misleading consumers about the risks of smoking ""light"" cigarettes. Philip Morris USA said it will appeal immediately.Tuesday's decision by the Fifth District Court of Appeals in Mount Vernon, Illinois, revives a 2003 judgment handed down by a state trial judge.That judgment against the maker of Marlboro cigarettes had been overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court in 2005, a ruling that the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the following year.In 2008, the plaintiffs sought to revive their case after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rescinded a 42-year-old policy on how cigarette makers could describe tar and nicotine levels in their advertising and packaging.A state court judge dismissed the case in December 2012, but Justice Melissa Chapman wrote for a three-judge appeals court panel that he lacked authority to speculate how the policy change might affect damages. She said the effect of overturning the dismissal was to reinstate the original verdict.The lawsuit, brought on behalf roughly 1.4 million Illinois smokers, began in 2000.

5,"  (Adds Altria comment, Reynolds and Lorillard not immediately available for comment)By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK, June 18 A federal judge said on Wednesday New York City may prevent retailers from offering discounts on cigarettes and other tobacco products, rejecting an industry effort to halt enforcement of a law designed to curb tobacco purchases.U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan said the city may block stores from selling the products at below list price, whether by running sales, redeeming coupons, offering bulk discounts or providing free lighters or other non-tobacco products with purchases.Industry trade groups, as well as cigarette makers, including Philip Morris parent Altria Group Inc, Reynolds American Inc and Lorillard Inc, complained that the limits violated their free speech rights and were pre-empted by other federal and state laws.The limits on discounts were part of a sweeping law signed last November by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg as part of an effort to dissuade people from smoking. Other changes included raising the minimum legal age to buy tobacco to 21 from 18, setting a minimum $10.50 price for a pack of cigarettes, boosting penalties for illegal tobacco sales and increasing enforcement against non-payment of excise taxes.In upholding the limits on discounts, Griesa said pricing restrictions ""designed to discourage consumption of a potentially harmful product"" were constitutional so long as retailers could still provide ""truthful, non-misleading information"" to consumers.""The ordinance only regulates an economic transaction - the sale of tobacco products below the listed price,"" he wrote. ""It does not restrict the dissemination of pricing information and thus, it does not violate the First Amendment."" Altria spokesman Brian May said: ""We disagree with the court's decision, and are considering our appellate options.""Spokesmen for Reynolds American and Lorillard, as well as lawyers for both companies, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ""This is a huge victory for the city's comprehensive efforts to reduce tobacco usage,"" Nicholas Ciappetta, a senior lawyer for the city, said in a statement.Bloomberg's more than decade-old campaign to ban smoking in various public and private places and to discourage New Yorkers from smoking altogether has become a blueprint for other cities.The City Council has estimated that the enacted changes have helped reduce smoking rates in the city by nearly one-third for adults and roughly one-half for children.Bloomberg left office 5-1/2 months ago, after serving 12 years as mayor.The case is National Association of Tobacco Outlets Inc et al v. City of New York et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-00577.

6,"  CHICAGO Aug 25 Electronic cigarettes may be more tempting to non-smoking youths than conventional cigarettes, and once young people have tried e-cigarettes they are more inclined to give regular cigarettes a try, U.S. researchers said on Monday.A report, released by a team at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lends evidence to the argument that electronic cigarettes encourage youth smoking.The study, based on nationally representative youth surveys, found that more than a quarter-million adolescents and teens who had never smoked used an electronic cigarette in 2013, a threefold increase from 2011.Youths who had tried e-cigarettes were nearly twice as likely to say they would try a conventional cigarette in the next year compared with those who had never tried an e-cigarette, according to the study in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research.E-cigarettes are slim, reusable, metal-tube devices containing nicotine-laced liquids that come in exotic flavors. When users puff, the nicotine is heated and released as a vapor containing no tar, unlike conventional cigarette smoke. Health experts have raised concerns that the burgeoning $2 billion e-cigarette industry, which has been virtually unregulated, would reverse gains in the decades-long effort to curb youth smoking in the United States. Just 15.7 percent of U.S. teenagers reported smoking in 2013, the lowest rate on record.In April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed rules that would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to anyone under 18 but would not restrict flavored products, online sales or advertising, which public health advocates say attract children. Earlier this month, attorneys general from 29 states urged the FDA to strengthen those rules to better protect young people from nicotine addiction.""We are very concerned about nicotine use among our youth, regardless of whether it comes from conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes or other tobacco products,"" Dr. Tim McAfee, director of CDC's Office on Smoking and Health, said in a statement. ""Not only is nicotine highly addictive, it can harm adolescent brain development.""In the CDC study, researchers analyzed data from the 2011, 2012, and 2013 National Youth Tobacco Surveys of students in grades 6-12. They found that more than 263,000 who had never smoked a conventional cigarette used e-cigarettes in 2013, up from 79,000 in 2011.Among non-smoking youth who had tried electronic cigarettes, 43.9 percent said they intended to smoke conventional cigarettes within the next year, compared with 21.5 percent of those who had never used e-cigarettes.Lorillard Inc leads the U.S. e-cigarette market, while Reynolds American Inc and Altria Group Inc  are rolling out their own brands nationwide this summer. A Wells Fargo analyst report in July projected that U.S. sales of e-cigarettes would outpace conventional ones by 2020.

11,"   By Jonathan Stempel | Sept 24  Sept 24 The Illinois Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to hear Philip Morris USA's appeal of a $10.1 billion verdict accusing the Altria Group Inc unit of misleading consumers about the risks of smoking ""light"" cigarettes.Philip Morris, which makes Marlboro cigarettes, is seeking to overturn an intermediate state appeals court's April 30 reinstatement of the award, which had been imposed by a trial judge in 2003 and overturned two years later.The award has been on hold during the current appeal. A decision is not expected for at least several months.Altria is based in Richmond, Virginia, and controls roughly half of the U.S. cigarette market. Its shares hit a record high on Wednesday, and were up 83 cents at $45.65 in late afternoon trading. The class-action case was brought in 2000 on behalf of 1.4 million Illinois smokers, and was the first to go to trial over the use of the word ""light"" to promote cigarettes.Philip Morris was accused of deceiving consumers into believing that ""light"" or ""low tar"" cigarettes were safer than regular cigarettes.Unlike in many smoking cases, the plaintiffs sought to recoup sums they claimed to spend on light cigarettes, not money for health-related claims. They revived their case after the Federal Trade Commission in 2008 changed its policy on how cigarette makers could describe tar and nicotine levels in advertising and packaging.A state court judge dismissed the case again in December 2012. But the appeals court said that judge lacked authority to decide how the policy change affected damages, and reinstated the original verdict. ""We feel very confident that the trial record below will be sustained, and look forward to rearguing the merits in court,"" said George Zelcs, a partner at Korein Tillery in Chicago who represents the plaintiffs, in a phone interview.Murray Garnick, an associate general counsel at Altria, in a statement said there are ""compelling reasons"" for the Illinois Supreme Court to again rule for Philip Morris USA.U.S. regulators have since June 2010 banned companies from using ""light,"" ""low"" and ""mild"" in tobacco labeling.The case is Philip Morris Inc v.

12,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to  Altria Group, Inc.'s (Altria) proposed senior unsecured notes issuance. A total  of $1 billion in notes are being issued with a maturity date in 2020. The Rating  Outlook is Stable. At Sept. 30, 2014, Altria had approximately $14 billion of  total debt. The senior unsecured notes will rank equal to Altria's other existing and future  senior unsecured indebtedness. The notes will be guaranteed by Philip Morris USA  Inc. (PM USA) Altria's wholly owned subsidiary and subject to a Change of  Control provision, whereby the company will be required to make an offer to  purchase the notes at 101% plus accrued and unpaid interest upon a change of  control and a downgrade below investment grade. Net proceeds from the offering  will be used for general corporate purposes.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  Market Leading Positions  Altria maintains leadership in the U.S. cigarette market with its Marlboro  franchise, and leading positions in moist smokeless tobacco (MST) with its  Copenhagen brand and in tipped cigars with Black & Mild. PM USA, the company's  cigarette manufacturing subsidiary, commands around one-half of the U.S.  marketplace bolstered by Marlboro's nearly 44% share. The company's MST  offerings, Copenhagen and Skoal, also represent about one-half of the domestic  MST market on a combined basis. Fitch believes that Altria's key smokeable and  smokeless brands can hold current market share given no meaningful market  disruption anticipated over the ratings horizon.  Accelerating Secular Volume Decline The U.S. marketplace for tobacco cigarettes continues to dwindle by the  mid-single digits annually as the smoking population declines (adults that  smoked fell to record low of 18% of the U.S. population in 2013). Cigarette  consumption in the U.S. has fallen by compound annual rate of 2.5% through 2012  since peaking at 640 billion sticks in 1981.  Altria, with around one-half of the U.S. marketplace, is most at risk in the  industry by the secular volume declines. The company maintains some  diversification across its product portfolio with smoking alternatives and wine;  however, the smokeable tobacco business represents around 86% of revenues and  earnings. Altria's ability to achieve net price realization has kept net  revenues positive in the smokeable segment despite the volume pressure. Reversal  of positive price realization for tobacco products in the absence of a viable  source of profitability outside of the tobacco category would have negative  consequences for Altria's ratings.  Steady Leverage Despite Volume Pressure Altria's gross debt leverage (total debt to EBITDA) has been in the range of  1.8x to 2.1x since 2008 and was 1.81x for the LTM ending Sept. 30, 2014 and  1.89x in 2013, both measures slightly better than Fitch's expectations due to  stronger EBITDA growth and a lower debt load. Altria defended margins from the  volume declines by controlling operating costs (mainly cigarette infrastructure), having completed two cost savings programs over the past few  years. EBITDA margins have expanded because of the cost initiatives to 43.6% for  the LTM ending Sept. 30, 2014 from 39.3% in 2011. Fitch expects the current  leverage level will be sustained through the long-term absent leveraging  transactions.  SABMiller Stake Supports Strong Liquidity Significantly bolstering Altria's liquidity is the company's 26.8% share of  SABMiller plc., currently valued at $24 billion. Internal liquidity provided by  operating cash flow (OCF) is strong at $4.58 billion for the LTM period ending  Sept. 30, 2014 and $4.38 billion in 2013. OCF has covered large dividends  payments and modest capital spending since 2008, excluding 2010, yielding  positive free cash flow with margins fluctuating in the 1% to 4% range during  this time.  Altria also had cash of $2.2 billion and full availability under a recently  extended $3 billion five-year revolver (due August 2019) at Sept. 30, 2014.  Excess liquidity is important given Altria's annual payment in April to the  Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) that is approximately $4 billion. Debt  maturities over the rating horizon are manageable, including $1 billion of  unsecured notes due in 2015, given the company's solid liquidity.  Financial strategy emphasizes heavy shareholder returns:  Limited acquisition opportunities and light capital spending (at or below 1%)  affords Altria the flexibility to return significant cash flows to shareholders  via large dividend payments and aggressive share repurchasing. Fitch expects the  same shareholder-friendly posture through the ratings horizon including dividend  payouts around 80% that has led to payments for the LTM ended Sept. 30, 2014  totaling $3.82 billion.  Share repurchases significantly increased to more than $1 billion in 2011 and  2012 but moderated in 2013 to $634 million. The company already purchased over  $679 billion in shares through the first nine months of 2014. Fitch sees the  strategy as manageable at current cash flows and with leverage (total debt to  EBITDA) sustained around 2.0x.  Industry factors limit ratings upside Positive action to current credit ratings is restrained by key factors in the  mature industry, specifically secular volume declines, high litigation exposure,  rising regulatory risks and an accommodative shareholder stance. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action:  --Mitigation of negative industry factors with an emphasis on the slowing or  reversal of secular volume declines;  --Altria fully offsetting cigarette volume pressures with meaningful portfolio  diversification; --Significantly reducing litigation risk, most notably the Engle progeny  exposure; --A commitment to a conservative financial strategy demonstrated by lower  dividend payouts and less-aggressive share repurchasing. Future developments that may individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action:  --Altria has some flexibility to accommodate a more aggressive  shareholder-friendly stance or acquisition activity, but gross leverage  approaching 2.5x would warrant a one-notch downgrade;  --EBITDA pressures arising from greater-than-expected market contraction  resulting from accelerated volume declines or a heightened competitive  environment, such that gross leverage rises and stays around 2.5x; --Regulatory decisions immediately banning sale of mentholated cigarettes or  meaningfully increasing excise taxes on smoking products that significantly  further suppresses volume and demand; --Dramatic changes in the litigation process, whereby legal cases may reach  verdict quicker and/or material adverse judgments significantly increase.

Reynolds Tobacco Co, Lorillard Inc and Altria Group's  Philip Morris USA - will pay $100 million to settle hundreds of federal lawsuits over smoking, according to an announcement from plaintiffs' lawyers on Wednesday.The agreement will cover more than 400 lawsuits filed in federal court in Florida by smokers or their families, according to court filings. The settlement will not cover cases that have already gone to trial, or thousands of lawsuits in state court. The tentative agreement will be finalized if all individual plaintiffs participate, or the parties otherwise agree.Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds will each pay $42.5 million, and Lorillard will pay $15 million, according to a lead lawyer for plaintiffs, Joe Rice of law firm Motley Rice.Rice and other plaintiffs' firms that negotiated the deal said Wednesday they were pleased their clients would be compensated after years of litigation. It is the first major agreement reached by the three companies to resolve a chunk of so-called Engle cases, named after a class action brought by Florida residents over injuries or deaths they said were caused by tobacco-related medical conditions.In 2006, the Florida Supreme Court overturned a $145 billion award for the class and ruled that plaintiffs had too many individual issues to proceed as a group. However, the court said plaintiffs could bring individual lawsuits based on findings from earlier in the litigation that nicotine is addictive and that tobacco use can cause diseases. After that ruling, thousands of cases were filed in Florida federal and state courts. All three companies have been hit with millions of dollars in damages from dozens of Engle cases that have gone to trial.In 2013, Liggett Group and parent company Vector Group Ltd  paid $110 million to nearly 5,000 smoking lawsuits. Murray Garnick, associate general counsel for Altria Client Services, said the agreement was in the company's best interests and that it will vigorously defend unsettled lawsuits.R.J.

19,"  LONDON Philip Morris International (PM.N) and its American counterpart Altria Group (MO.N) announced on Thursday an expansion of their agreement on e-cigarettes to include research and development, as the market for tobacco alternatives continues to evolve. The companies, which split from each other in 2008, said in 2013 that Philip Morris would have the exclusive right to sell Altria's e-cigarettes outside the United States, and Altria the exclusive right to sell two of Philip Morris's ""heated tobacco products"" in the United States. They also said they would cooperate on scientific assessments of the products, engaging with regulators and sharing improvements in the products.On Thursday, the companies said they were expanding that framework to include a joint research, development and technology-sharing agreement, which a Philip Morris spokeswoman said would set a framework to develop the next generation of e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes, which heat nicotine-laced liquid into an inhalable vapor, have been growing in popularity on both sides of the Atlantic, but remain the subject of much debate due largely to a lack of long-term data about their effects on health. Still, many scientists believe they are much safer than traditional cigarettes.  Altria sells an e-cigarette called MarkTen in the United States, which Philip Morris sells in Spain under the brand name Solaris. Philip Morris also sells Marlboro HeatSticks, made from tobacco, in Italy and Japan.    Separately on Thursday, Philip Morris, the world's leading tobacco company, said it was dissolving a joint venture with Swedish Match (SWMA.ST) that was aimed at selling snus, a type of smokeless tobacco, outside Scandinavia and the United States. The companies said there was a small but growing demand for snus in those markets but that ""development has ... taken longer than the parties had initially anticipated"".The companies will now pursue their own strategies, though there are transitional agreements in place whereby Swedish Match will supply snus to Philip Morris for certain markets, and Philip Morris will distribute the Swedish company's snus in Canada and Russia.

21,"  Anheuser-Busch InBev SA (ABI.BR) reached out to SABMiller Plc's SAB.L largest shareholder, Altria Group Inc (MO.N), before making a takeover approach, Bloomberg reported.Cigarette maker Altria, which owns a 27 percent stake in SABMiller, has signaled it is open to considering a proposal, depending on the terms, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. SABMiller, the world's No. 2 brewer, said on Wednesday it had been informed that AB InBev intended to make an offer which it would have to do by Oct. 14 under British rules.AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, is also close to lining up a group of banks to help finance a deal and a takeover proposal may come as soon as the financing is in place, Bloomberg reported on Friday. Banks are willing to offer more than $50 billion of debt for the acquisition, one of the people said.Analysts have said AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds ($62) per SABMiller share, and maybe as much as 45 pounds, implying an overall price of up to $130 billion, including SABMiller's debt. Altria and AB InBev declined to comment on the Bloomberg report.

22,"  (Adds background, details)Sept 18 Anheuser-Busch InBev SA reached out to SABMiller Plc's largest shareholder, Altria Group Inc, before making a takeover approach, Bloomberg reported.Cigarette maker Altria, which owns a 27 percent stake in SABMiller, has signaled it is open to considering a proposal, depending on the terms, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. (bloom.bg/1QMbe4d)SABMiller, the world's No. 2 brewer, said on Wednesday it had been informed that AB InBev intended to make an offer which it would have to do by Oct. 14 under British rules. AB InBev, the world's largest brewer, is also close to lining up a group of banks to help finance a deal and a takeover proposal may come as soon as the financing is in place, Bloomberg reported on Friday.Banks are willing to offer more than $50 billion of debt for the acquisition, one of the people said. Analysts have said AB InBev will have to pay at least 40 pounds ($62) per SABMiller share, and maybe as much as 45 pounds, implying an overall price of up to $130 billion, including SABMiller's debt.

23,"   By Philip Blenkinsop and Martinne Geller | BRUSSELS/LONDON, Sept 30  BRUSSELS/LONDON, Sept 30 A $70 billion debt package being arranged to fund Anheuser-Busch InBev's  takeover of SABMiller still leaves the world's largest brewer with a tricky balancing act in satisfying a range of shareholder camps with different needs.SABMiller's two major shareholders face potential capital gains taxes, so may want to get paid in shares - which would conflict with AB InBev's controlling shareholders' desire to limit the dilution to their control that would come with issuing new shares.Furthermore, some shareholders might have geographical restrictions tied to the location of the share listing.Marlboro maker Altria and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia together own 42 percent of SABMiller, and are widely believed to prefer shares in an enlarged company rather than cash, to avoid triggering capital gains taxes on the proceeds of their stakes, worth about $24 billion and $13 billion, respectively, at current prices.""We can say with confidence that Santo Domingo and Altria will want a decent chunk of equity, probably the majority,"" said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Eamonn Ferry. ""The wild card is how much of the free float would want equity too,"" he added, referring to shareholders beyond the major two.AB InBev, maker of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona,    is expected to have offered between 40 and 45 pounds per share for its nearest rival within the next two weeks. It is already asking banks to underwrite up to $70 billion in debt financing, sources have told Reuters.With a deal therefore costing as much as $110 billion, that leaves a likely share issue of as much as $40 billion, a ratio that roughly fits the 60/40 split expected by analysts, who note the Brazilian and Belgian founding families of AB InBev, who own 52 percent of its shares, would not want to largely dilute their control by issuing too much new equity.""It is hard to over-estimate the importance that ABI assigns to this ownership structure,"" said Nomura analysts earlier this month. ""This drives an ownership culture and a long-term view."" SABMiller said on Sept. 16 that AB InBev had approached it about a friendly takeover that would form a combined group brewing a third of the world's beer. UK takeover rules require AB InBev to make a formal offer by Oct. 14, though the parties are not required to disclose the offer.Despite the combination having been discussed for years, sources say one of the difficulties in pulling it off is finding a structure that ensures the two biggest shareholders get shares and the rest cash, while still offering the same to all shareholders.""That's the problem,"" said an industry banker not involved in the deal.SABMiller and AB InBev declined to comment. Officials representing Altria and the Santo Domingo family could not immediately be reached. FOUNDING FAMILIES One way to ease dilution of control is to bring the Santo Domingo family into the core group of controlling insiders, say analysts. That would makes sense given the family are founders of a Colombian brewer that SABMiller bought in 2005, and the controlling group includes the founding families of AB InBev.""The Santo Domingos clearly know the beer business quite well. They'd be more than happy to have money invested in ABI and the 3G guys,"" said Exane's Ferry, referring to private equity firm 3G Capital, which is run by some of AB InBev's controlling shareholders.3G gained control of U.S. food group Kraft Heinz  following deals financed in part by billionaire Warren Buffett. Members of the Santo Domingo family have invested with 3G, according to the Wall Street Journal. Depending on price, AB InBev's core shareholder group could see their ownership of the merged group fall from 52 percent to just over 40 percent with that level of new equity. If Santo Domingo's shares were added to the core group, it could rise back to nearly 50 percent, according to some analysts.Equity financing would mean a far higher new share component than when InBev bought Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion in 2008. A rights issue of just 6.4 billion euros meant AB InBev's net debt to EBITDA (core profit) ratio soared to more than five times.In an SAB deal, analysts see that multiple being just over four, after likely required disposals in the United States and China.Furthermore, there is a group of South African shareholders, three of which own 5 percent of the company, who have long ties with the South African-born brewer and might like to participate in its future growth.But their future ownership could hinge on a continued stock listing in Johannesburg.If the dilution is too great, Societe Generale analyst Andrew Holland suggests a ""backstop"" share buyback at a later stage.""The disadvantage is that the buyback would have to be done as a tender offer, which would probably have to be at a premium to whatever ABI's shares trade on at the time,"" he said.($1 = 0.6605 pounds)   (Editing by David Holmes)",2015-09-30,MO,"Wed Sep 30, 2015 | 3:47pm EDT",AB InBev faces delicate balance in structuring SABMiller bid,http://www.reuters.com//article/sabmiller-ma-abinbev-structure-idUSL5N12023Z20150930?type=companyNews

27,"  * CEO repeats frustration, says rival's view lacks credibility* SABMiller board says proposal substantially undervalue company   (Adds Breakingviews link)By Philip Blenkinsop and Martinne GellerBRUSSELS/LONDON, Oct 8 Anheuser-Busch InBev  Chief Executive Carlos Brito repeated his appeal to SABMiller shareholders on Thursday, again urging them to push the brewer's board into more serious takeover discussions.The Brazilian boss of Belgium-based AB InBev expressed frustration at the board of its UK rival, continuing a strategy begun on Wednesday, which one analyst called going ""hostile lite"", referring to an acquirer putting its terms direct to a target's shareholders.The stakes are high for both, the world's No. 1 and 2 brewers, whose combination would be the fifth largest merger in corporate history, according to Thomson Reuters data.AB InBev said it was surprised the SABMiller board said its takeover offer of 42.15 pounds per share, made public on Wednesday, ""still very substantially undervalues"" SABMiller.It noted the price is a 44 percent premium to SAB's share price on Sept. 14, the last day before renewed speculation of its approach. The premium, and the fact that SAB's largest shareholder, tobacco group Altria, supports the offer, show SAB's stance ""lacks credibility"", it said. ""How long will it be before shareholders see a value of over 42 pounds in the absence of an offer from AB InBev?"" Brito said in a statement on Thursday.""If shareholders agree that we should be in proper discussions, they should voice their views and should not allow the board of SABMiller to frustrate this process and let this opportunity slip away.""An SAB spokesman said the company noted AB InBev's announcement, which it said ""contains nothing new."" FORMAL BID AB InBev has until Oct. 14 to make a formal bid, unless SAB agrees to continue talks and applies for an extension. The deadline and lack of board engagement were the reasons Brito gave on Wednesday for going public with his third offer.The appeal to SAB's minority shareholders ""could be interpreted as a 'hostile lite' approach,"" said Berenberg analyst Javier Gonzalez Lastra. ""If AB InBev does indeed have the support of both Altria and BevCo ... it would appear natural that there is some probability that AB InBev eventually goes hostile,"" Lastra said. Altria and the BevCo company of Colombia's Santo Domingo family together own almost 41 percent of the company.Brito on Wednesday said it was premature to talk about a hostile bid.While AB InBev's cash offer of 42.15 per share would give SAB a market value of 68 billion pounds, the company would only really pay 65 billion pounds because of an alternative discounted offer of cash and shares, designed for Altria and BevCo.Altria, with a 26.6 percent stake, has endorsed the proposal, but the Santo Domingos have not.AB InBev also said SABMiller's board had referred to significant regulatory hurdles in the United States and Canada on which AB InBev had ""not yet provided comfort"". AB InBev said it had done significant work to find solutions and had repeatedly offered to share this analysis with SABMiller.""Each time the board of SABMiller has refused to engage,"" the brewer said.

36,"  BRUSSELS Brewer SABMiller Plc SAB.L has extended the deadline for rival Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) to make a formal $100 billion-plus takeover offer by a further week in order to finalize shareholder support for the deal.The two companies said in a joint statement on Wednesday that London's Panel on Takeovers and Mergers had granted SABMiller's request to push back the deadline to 5 p.m. (12.00 midnight ET) on Wednesday, November 11.The Takeover Panel has already granted a series of extensions since AB InBev and SABMiller said they had reached a preliminary agreement on a takeover on Oct. 13.Since then, AB InBev has completed a due diligence review of its target, reconfirmed the terms of its proposed offer and negotiated facilities to fund a takeover at short notice.  The two companies said on Wednesday that they had made good progress in agreeing terms and AB InBev had entered into the funding facilities, but still needed a further week to finalize discussions and satisfy pre-conditions.Last week, Chief Financial Officer Felipe Dutra said the extension was needed for lawyers to finalize documents related to shareholder support for the deal. AB InBev is offering 44 pounds per SABMiller share, along with a discounted alternative mostly of shares and designed for SABMiller's two largest shareholders, cigarette-maker Altria (MO.N) and BevCo, the vehicle of Colombia's Santo Domingo family, who together own 40.5 percent of the target company. The takeover currently worth $107 billion would create a brewing colossus making about a third of all beer drunk and would be the largest of a British-based company and the fourth-biggest overall in corporate history.

37,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK S&P Dow Jones Indices is negotiating with asset managers to license its new index, which it says represents companies that focus on the long term rather than the current quarter.   The Long-Term Value Creation Global Index .SPLTVCUN could be the basis for one or more mutual funds, exchange-traded funds or structured products, Vinit Srivastava, S&P's senior director of equity strategy, said in an interview last week.    S&P created the index over the past year in response to concerns that company executives, under pressure from hard-charging board overseers and the earnings calendar, have put short-term wins ahead of building businesses that thrive over time.Designed with the help of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the index consists of companies with what S&P considers strong corporate-governance plans and solid financial numbers.""We have to do things to stop that short-term focus,"" said Poul Winslow, managing director at Toronto-based CPPIB. He said the index relied on a scoring system that draws out important details about how companies are governed.The CPPIB and other institutional investors have committed $2 billion to private funds tracking the index.S&P, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc MHFI.N and the largest provider of indexes tracked by U.S.-listed ETFs, has not decided whether such a license would be exclusive to one asset manager. Srivastava declined to name any bidders or comment further on the discussions. Bringing such a product to market could take several months of planning and regulatory approvals.Asset managers have already had something of a hand in the effort. Focusing Capital on the Long Term, a group that advocated for the index and was founded by CPPIB and management consultant McKinsey & Co in 2013, counts senior management from fund-managing companies BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and State Street Corp (STT.N) among its members and advisers. DEFINING LONG-TERM To come up with its index, S&P starts with the largest public companies and allocates money to those that produce a hefty return on equity and seem to develop strong policies on legal compliance, environmental reporting and philanthropy. Such practices, advocates like Winslow said, can predict performance better than balance sheets.Among the top companies in the index are health insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N), coffee chain Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and industrial conglomerate 3M Co (MMM.N). However, the index does not screen out companies that spend cash buying back their own shares, even though such repurchases have been criticized by investors who would rather see the money go to long-term ventures like capital expenditures or workforce development. One of the long-term index's top holdings, retailer O'Reilly Automotive Inc (ORLY.O), is also one of the largest components of the S&P 500 Buyback Index .SPBUYUP.Srivastava said companies with good governance rules tend to do buybacks ""for the right reasons.""The index's focus on corporate governance does not necessarily mean a focus on social issues, even though pension funds often consider such criteria.Two of the index's top 10 holdings are tobacco companies Reynolds American Inc (RAI.N) and Altria Group Inc (MO.N), which socially conscious investors often screen out.

38,"   By Maiya Keidan and Sinead Cruise | LONDON  LONDON The Children's Investment Fund Management (TCI) has taken a stake in SABMiller SAB.L, the second activist to buy into the brewer in recent weeks, raising the prospect of a late push for improved takeover terms from AB InBev (ABI.BR).The move by TCI comes ahead of SABMiller's annual meeting in London on Thursday when investors could question terms of a $100 billion-plus deal that now appear to favor its two largest shareholders after a steep drop in the value of sterling.British-based TCI, best known for its investments in troubled carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and French aerospace group Safran (SAF.PA), has acquired just under 1 percent of SABMiller's stock, a source familiar with the matter said.TCI's acquisition of a small stake follows news that fellow hedge fund Elliott Advisors had taken a 1.3 percent stake in the London-listed maker of beers like Peroni and Grolsch, which it later raised to about 1.5 percent, regulatory filings showed. The appearance of two of the world's most powerful activists on the SABMiller shareholder register has prompted talk among some institutional investors that Elliott and TCI could lead a push for AB InBev to improve its 44 pounds-per-share cash offer, aimed at the majority of shareholders. SAB shares traded at 44.31 pounds at 1130 GMT on Monday.The source declined to describe the motives or rationale behind TCI's stakebuilding, but did say the hedge fund ""obviously has an interest in the deal and how it pans out"". TCI and SABMiller declined to comment.The main offer is now lower than a special cash-and-stock offer designed for SAB's biggest two investors, cigarette maker Altria (MO.N) and Colombia's Santo Domingo family, who together own about 40 percent of the company.When the deal was announced in November, that partial share alternative -- which avoids triggering large tax bills -- was worth about 39 pounds. But the recent fall in the pound and rise in ABI's shares have increased its value to about 51 pounds. ROCK THE BOAT? ""Given all the regulatory hoops that the deal has already had to jump through it might be dangerous to rock the boat too much, but Elliott must have taken a view that they can get the offer upped without altering the timetable of the deal materially,"" one of SAB's top 15 investors told Reuters.Investor advisor Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. has written to clients to point out the relative improvement in the value of the partial share alternative, noting that it now represents a 16 percent premium to the broader offer, instead of a 4.9 percent discount.  It also pointed out that while the alternative offer was technically open to all investors, it seemed ""designed to be unappealing"" to most fund managers since the shares are unlisted and cannot be traded for five years.The deal is currently structured as a ""scheme of arrangement"" which requires approval by 75 percent of SAB's shareholders. The vote is expected to take place only once outstanding antitrust approvals have been granted. Another source close to the deal suggested the activists might struggle to garner enough support among SAB shareholders to call for a rewrite of the terms at this late stage, especially since the deal has already received two of the four required approvals from European and South African regulators.""It's a dangerous game and there's no certainty that ABI is willing to raise its offer,"" the source said.""The pound is going back up and this plays in favor of the existing arrangement...Shareholders want to get this deal done.""

39,"  LONDON SABMiller SAB.L has not ruled out asking Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) to revamp its proposed $100 billion-plus takeover offer before formally recommending the bid, a source close to the London-listed brewer told Reuters, amid rising shareholder disquiet about the terms. SABMiller's board is meeting on Wednesday, a day before its annual shareholder meeting, to discuss how to quell unease about the disparity between ABI's 44-pounds per share cash offer and a stock-and-cash alternative designed for SAB's biggest investors, cigarette maker Altria (MO.N) and Colombia's Santo Domingo family, the source said.When the original deal was announced in November, that partial share alternative -- which avoids triggering large tax bills -- was worth about 39 pounds. But the recent fall in the pound and rise in ABI's shares have increased its value to about 51 pounds, representing a premium of around 15 percent to the cash offer.All investors have the option to take the stock and cash offer but under current terms the stock cannot be traded for five years, rendering the option highly unattractive for most fund managers.""At this stage the board will reassure investors and tell them their concerns will only be addressed after the deal gets regulatory clearance,"" the first source close to SAB said.""After the pre-conditions are satisfied, (the board) will need to decide whether to refresh its recommendation for the ABI bid or ask for improved terms,"" the source added.SABMiller declined to comment. A second source close to SABMiller described the long-planned meeting as ""routine"" prior to an AGM and said it was unconnected to recent stakebuilding by activist investors The Children's Investment Fund Management (TCI) and Elliott Advisors. Those investments have raised the prospects of a late opportunistic push for more cash from ABI, which counts Budweiser and Stella Artois among its top brands.    APPROVALS  ABI's proposed takeover has already been approved by European and South African regulators but U.S. and Chinese antitrust authorities have yet to sanction the union.Until then, the deal terms remain flexible and subject to revision, the first source said. ""Regulatory approval is expected very soon. It could come any time now and this is why agitators are building stakes,"" the source said. Minority investors meanwhile are waiting nervously to see if any last-minute jostling could secure them more cash or derail the merger altogether.""They (Elliott) have previous form here in trying to extract value close to decision day ... but the deal feels done so it may be too little too late,"" said one SABMiller investor, who said he would back a campaign for fresh terms as it was in his clients' interests.""The fall in sterling makes the cash offer less attractive to general shareholders. The 'insiders' got a better deal here than the other shareholders,"" he said.Besides increasing the cash offer to minority investors, sources have suggested that ABI could also address the disparity by increasing the cash component offered to Altria and the Santo Domingos or reducing the lock-up period on the shares. Currently structured as a 'scheme of arrangement', the deal needs approval by 75 percent of shareholders but sources also said ABI could switch to a straight takeover offer, which only needs a majority.

40,"   By Philip Blenkinsop and Freya Berry | BRUSSELS/LONDON  BRUSSELS/LONDON Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) raised its $100 billion-plus bid for rival brewer SABMiller on Tuesday in an attempt to quash investor dissent over an offer made less attractive by a post Brexit vote fall in the pound.    SABMiller SAB.L said its chairman spoke with his AB InBevcounterpart on Friday about that offer in the light of exchange rate volatility and market movements, but there was no talk or agreement on the terms of the revised offer of 45 pounds a share, up from 44 pounds in October.    The change comes after a number of activist investors, such as Elliott Capital Advisors and TCI Fund Management, bought stakes in SABMiller and several shareholders voiced concerns at least week's annual general meeting that the cash deal was less attractive for most investors than before and was below a share-and-cash alternative.    AB InBev (ABI) said the revised terms were final, which under British law means the price is set, unless the bidder drops its offer and waits six months to make another.     However, Aberdeen Asset Management (ADN.L), with a 1.17percent SABMiller stake according to Thomson Reuters data, said the revised offer was still unacceptable, although analysts said they thought the deal was now likely to go through.    Bernstein Research beverage analyst Trevor Stirling said SABMiller's shares would probably drop to 41.50 pounds if ABInBev's takeover bid failed.     ""The broader base of shareholders can take the money and run.... or seek to call ABI's bluff,"" said Bernstein Research analyst Trevor Stirling. Another analyst likened the situation to a game of chicken that ABI was trying to head off.    The world's largest brewer, seeking to secure attractive markets in Latin America and Africa by taking over its nearest rival, also improved the terms of an alternative share-and-cash offer designed for SABMiller's two largest shareholders.     The slide in the value of the pound following Britain's vote to leave the European Union has made the deal less attractive for all the other investors, while the rise of AB InBev shares in the past nine months has made the alternative option more so.    The new offer values SABMiller at around 79 billion pounds ($103.6 billion). In November, when the original bid was officially launched, it was worth around 70 billion pounds, or$106 billion based on exchange rates at the time. That original bid had since dropped to about $100 billion.    The share and cash offer, designed exclusively for Altria and Colombia's Santo Domingo family who together own about 41percent of SABMiller, had been worth less than the all-cash option last year, but with the fall of sterling and a rise of ABInBev shares, has since surpassed it.    For a foreign dollar-based investor, the cash offer had dropped 12 percent since the British referendum on June 23.Meanwhile, AB InBev shares are more than 35 percent higher than in October.          MODEST INCREASE     Aberdeen Asset Management said the revised offer undervalued the company and continued to favor Altria and Bevco, the Santo Domingos’ investment vehicle.    AB InBev said the share-and-cash offer value was now 51.14pounds, so above the 45 pounds of pure cash, but the new shares offered would have to be held for at least five years.     ""I wouldn’t like to second guess what the activists were hoping for, but the increase is quite modest,"" one SABMiller shareholder told Reuters.    Liberum analyst Alicia Forry said she believed the revised bid was likely to be successful by throwing a ""small bone"" to activist investors and shutting the door to further increases.    ""The main thing from ABI's perspective is they don't want this to drag and if they engaged (activists) it would,"" she said.    SABMiller, which provisionally agreed the deal struck in October, said it had taken on Centerview Partners as a new financial advisor and would consult with shareholders before formally considering the revised offer.    The takeover is still awaiting regulatory approval in China. SABMiller shareholders would expect to vote on it after that.    At 1445 GMT, SABMiller shares were down 0.4 percent at 44.20pounds. AB InBev's were up 0.6 percent at 115.50 euros.

44,"   By Martinne Geller | LONDON  LONDON SABMiller SAB.L has told employees to pause the integration of  its operations with those of Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) as the brewer's board weighs its sweetened takeover offer, two sources familiar with the matter said.  The pause is not an indication of the board's thinking, said one of the sources, who declined to be identified as the matter is private. Still, AB InBev's U.S.-listed shares fell 3 percent and shares of Molson Coors (TAP.N), which is set to take over SAB's U.S. operations, fell 5 percent on concerns about the fate of the $100 billion-plus deal, one of the biggest in corporate history.The world's top brewers agreed to merge late last year and for months have been engaged in back-office preparations, the sources said, aimed at smoothing the combination that was expected to start in the second half of the year when the deal was due to close.The deal, however, has hit the rocks in recent weeks amid investor dissent over an offer made less attractive by a sharp fall in the pound following Britain's vote to leave the European Union.In an effort to calm a stream of investor complaints, AB InBev sweetened its offer on Tuesday.That prompted SABMiller Chief Executive Alan Clark to call for a pause in ""convergence planning workstreams,"" according to a company memo published on Wednesday by the Financial Times' blog Alphaville. ""There should be no contact with AB InBev with immediate effect, and all meetings and calls will be postponed until further notice,"" the memo said, noting that it also applied to brewers Molson Coors and Asahi (2502.T), which are picking up assets that need to be divested in the deal, and all advisers and consultants.""This is another big piece of news to take in and I appreciate this will cause lots of internal and external speculation. However, please stay focused and I will keep you updated as soon as I am able to,"" Clark added. SAB officials declined to comment on the memo or the pause in integration, which was mentioned earlier on Wednesday by trade publication Beer Business Daily.  Denver-based Molson Coors, which on Monday announced leadership changes to take effect once the deal closes, also declined to comment, as did AB InBev.  MIXED RECEPTION                AB InBev's new offer is worth around 79 billion pounds, up from a November deal worth about 70 billion pounds. The steep weakening of the pound versus the dollar had reduced the value of that offer for U.S. investors, while a rise in AB InBev shares has increased the value of a special cash-and-share alternative aimed at SAB's two largest shareholders.The new offer, which is final, has met a mixed reception. Top 10 shareholder Aberdeen Asset Management (ADN.L) said the offer remained ""unacceptable"" as it undervalued the company and continued to favor those two major shareholders, cigarette maker Altria (MO.N) and Colombia's Santo Domingo family.  By contrast, New York-based hedge fund Twin Capital Management, also a shareholder, applauded the raised offer.""I'm hopeful it gets done. It should get done,"" Twin's CEO David Simon told Reuters, adding that he had conveyed that message to SABMiller management.South Africa's Public Investment Corporation (PIC), a top five shareholder, told Reuters it was in talks with SAB over the revised offer, but declined to make its view public.Following discussions with shareholders, SAB's board plans to meet to formally review the new offer.

46,"   By Martinne Geller and Philip Blenkinsop | LONDON/BRUSSELS  LONDON/BRUSSELS The board of brewer SABMiller SAB.L will recommend its shareholders approve a sweetened takeover offer by Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR), the company said on Friday, capping a week of high drama about the fate of the consumer industry's biggest-ever merger.The deal, worth 79 billion pounds ($104.9 billion), remains to be voted on by shareholders - a hurdle that could become harder to clear since the board intends to request that shareholders be divided into two classes, with each needing to  approve the terms.One prominent investor - Aberdeen Asset Management (ADN.L) -  voiced opposition to the revised offer, saying it still undervalued the maker of beers including Castle Lager and Pilsner Urquell, which has a strong footprint in fast-growing markets of Latin America and Africa.AB InBev added a pound-per-share to its cash bid on Tuesday to quash investor dissent over what would be the largest-ever takeover of a British company. Its earlier offer had been made less attractive by a sharp fall in sterling following Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union.  ""The board's decision was difficult given changes in circumstances since the board originally recommended £44 per share in cash last November,"" said SAB Chairman Jan du Plessis. ""We believe the final cash consideration of £45 per share to be at the lower end of the range of values considered recommendable.""    ""In reaching its decision, SAB's board considered the best interests of the company as a whole, taking into account all salient facts and circumstances,"" du Plessis said, adding that it had received extensive shareholder feedback.Bernstein Research analyst Trevor Stirling said that at current exchange rates, he expects the deal to get approved. ""It's better than walking away,"" he said. ""But if sterling falls another 5-10 percent then all bets are off.""TWO CLASSES  AB InBev, the Belgium-based maker of Budweiser and Stella Artois, also raised by 88 pence a special cash-and-stock alternative aimed at SAB's two largest shareholders, Altria (MO.N) and Bevco. That alternative had been at a discount to the cash offer last year, but given current exchange rates, is now at a premium.The board said it plans to ask the UK court overseeing the process to treat Altria and Bevco as a separate class of shareholders. Under that scenario, three-quarters of both classes of voting shareholders would be needed to pass the deal.If treated as a single class, the hurdle would be lower since Altria and Bevco have already pledged to vote in favour. Together they control about 41 percent of the company.Societe Generale analyst Andrew Holland said SAB had effectively upped the requirement on backing for the deal to a potential 85 percent. ""They appear to be cooperating but they're doing it in a way that is somewhat unhelpful to ABI."" AB InBev said it believes the proposed combination ""represents a compelling opportunity for all SABMiller and AB InBev shareholders"".AB InBev has secured conditional regulatory approval in China, its final pre-condition for the deal.Aberdeen reiterated on Friday that it would vote against the deal but said it welcomed the decision to treat the shareholders as different classes.The vote is likely to take place in October or November, and if the offer is approved, this would allow AB InBev to meet its target of closing the deal this year.

48,"   By Philip Blenkinsop and Ben Blanchard | BRUSSELS/BEIJING  BRUSSELS/BEIJING Brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) cleared a major hurdle toward its takeover of SABMiller SAB.L with regulatory approval from China on Friday, leaving the acquisition's future in the hands of the British company's board.China's ministry of commerce said it had approved the acquisition on condition that AB InBev fulfilled its commitment to sell SABMiller's stake in Chinese beer joint venture CR Snow.The maker of Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona said the conditional clearance meant it had satisfied all pre-conditions following earlier green lights from EU, U.S. and South African authorities.It is now waiting for the SABMiller board's recommendation on a revised $100-billion-plus bid proposed on Tuesday. AB InBev added a pound per share to its cash offer to quash investor dissent over an offer made less attractive by a fall in the sterling following Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union. It has also hiked its share-and-cash alternative by 88 pence.""This offer is final and cannot be increased or otherwise changed,"" Chief Executive Carlos Brito told a conference call after the company's second-quarter results. ""We believe the revised and final offer represents a compelling opportunity for all SABMiller shareholders.""SABMiller, with prized Latin American and African markets, has told employees to pause the integration of its operations with those of AB InBev as the board weighs the sweetened offer.Nevertheless, Brito said the two companies had made significant progress together since November on regulatory issues, bond financing and asset disposals in the United States, China and Europe, as well as general integration planning.""It remains our objective to close the transaction in 2016,"" he said, declining to give further details on the planned takeover.AB InBev's shares have yo-yoed according to the market's perception of the chances of a deal, which AB InBev needs to cement future growth. It would also take a big hit on its pound hedges if the takeover fell through. The shares fell sharply on Thursday after reports of SABMiller's integration pause, and were up 2.9 percent on Friday after reports that a number of activist shareholders broadly backed the deal.Those include Elliott Capital Advisors, which has built up a stake in recent weeks. Aberdeen Asset Management (ADN.L) on Tuesday called the offer unacceptable, but AB InBev already has the backing of the two largest shareholders - Altria (MO.N) and Bevco, the Santo Domingo family investment vehicle - hold almost 41 percent.Marshall Wace LLP, controlling just over 1 percent of SABMiller stock, said on Friday it supported the offer.""We are at a natural point for this business to move on and become part of a bigger company, so to reject this now, you just wonder what things would be like,"" said one of SABMiller's 20 largest investors who declined to be named Societe Generale analyst Andrew Holland said if the offer failed then SABMiller shares would fall back to 40 pounds or below and it would be a hard task for the company to recover that value.""If you bought in a long time ago at 10 pounds, you might be happy with 38, but more recent arrivals, of which there are a number, will see their value destroyed,"" he said.SABMiller shares were just below 44 pounds on Friday.  BRAZIL RECESSION  Brito was speaking after the company published its second-quarter results, exposing problems in Brazil and highlighting the attraction of the less-developed and high-growth African markets that a SABMiller takeover would offer.AB InBev's core profit in the second quarter rose 4.3 percent on a like-for-like basis to $4.01 billion, below the average Reuters poll forecast of $4.13 billion.The company saw earnings growth in the United States and China, but margin decline in Mexico and lower beer sales in its second-largest market, Brazil, due to a downturn that has dragged on for more than a year.The company sold 4.5 percent less beer in Brazil than a year earlier in April to June, an improvement from the 10 percent drop in the first quarter but below AB InBev's own forecasts.It said it expected Brazil revenue this year to be similar to the level of 2015, down from previous guidance of growth by a mid to high single-digit percentage. But it also cut its guidance for cost of sales per hectoliter to a low single-digit percentage increase, from a mid-single digit rise seen before, due to savings on procurement and efficiency and greater use of returnable bottles in Brazil. The company has forecast that its revenue per hectoliter overall will grow ahead of inflation, partly as it pushes drinkers over to more expensive beers, but with challenging conditions in Brazil and China.

AB InBev added a pound per share to its cash offer to quash investor dissent over an offer made less attractive by a fall in the sterling following Britain's vote in June to leave the European Union. It has also hiked its share-and-cash alternative by 88 pence.""This offer is final and cannot be increased or otherwise changed,"" Chief Executive Carlos Brito told a conference call after the company's second-quarter results. ""We believe the revised and final offer represents a compelling opportunity for all SABMiller shareholders.""SABMiller, with prized Latin American and African markets, has told employees to pause the integration of its operations with those of AB InBev as the board weighs the sweetened offer.Nevertheless, Brito said the two companies had made significant progress together since November on regulatory issues, bond financing and asset disposals in the United States, China and Europe, as well as general integration planning.""It remains our objective to close the transaction in 2016,"" he said, declining to give further details on the planned takeover.AB InBev's shares have yo-yoed according to the market's perception of the chances of a deal, which AB InBev needs to cement future growth. It would also take a big hit on its pound hedges if the takeover fell through. The shares fell sharply on Thursday after reports of SABMiller's integration pause, and were up 2.9 percent on Friday after reports that a number of activist shareholders broadly backed the deal.Those include Elliott Capital Advisors, which has built up a stake in recent weeks. Aberdeen Asset Management (ADN.L) on Tuesday called the offer unacceptable, but AB InBev already has the backing of the two largest shareholders - Altria (MO.N) and Bevco, the Santo Domingo family investment vehicle - hold almost 41 percent.Marshall Wace LLP, controlling just over 1 percent of SABMiller stock, said on Friday it supported the offer.""We are at a natural point for this business to move on and become part of a bigger company, so to reject this now, you just wonder what things would be like,"" said one of SABMiller's 20 largest investors who declined to be named Societe Generale analyst Andrew Holland said if the offer failed then SABMiller shares would fall back to 40 pounds or below and it would be a hard task for the company to recover that value.""If you bought in a long time ago at 10 pounds, you might be happy with 38, but more recent arrivals, of which there are a number, will see their value destroyed,"" he said.SABMiller shares were just below 44 pounds on Friday.  BRAZIL RECESSION  Brito was speaking after the company published its second-quarter results, exposing problems in Brazil and highlighting the attraction of the less-developed and high-growth African markets that a SABMiller takeover would offer.AB InBev's core profit in the second quarter rose 4.3 percent on a like-for-like basis to $4.01 billion, below the average Reuters poll forecast of $4.13 billion.The company saw earnings growth in the United States and China, but margin decline in Mexico and lower beer sales in its second-largest market, Brazil, due to a downturn that has dragged on for more than a year.The company sold 4.5 percent less beer in Brazil than a year earlier in April to June, an improvement from the 10 percent drop in the first quarter but below AB InBev's own forecasts.It said it expected Brazil revenue this year to be similar to the level of 2015, down from previous guidance of growth by a mid to high single-digit percentage. But it also cut its guidance for cost of sales per hectoliter to a low single-digit percentage increase, from a mid-single digit rise seen before, due to savings on procurement and efficiency and greater use of returnable bottles in Brazil. The company has forecast that its revenue per hectoliter overall will grow ahead of inflation, partly as it pushes drinkers over to more expensive beers, but with challenging conditions in Brazil and China.

53,"  BRUSSELS Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) and SABMiller SAB.L, the world's two largest brewers, set out a timetable on Monday for the final stages of their $100 billion-plus merger, with completion of the deal expected in a little more than two months.SABMiller's board agreed last week to an improved 79 billion pound ($104.3 billion) offer from AB InBev, which said it would now publish the takeover terms on Tuesday.A key step in the process is an Aug. 22 British court hearing to assess SABMiller's proposal that its shareholders should be divided into two classes, with each needing to approve the terms.AB InBev has put forward two variations of its offer: a straight 45 pounds per share intended for the majority of investors and a cash-and-shares offer aimed at SABMiller's two largest shareholders, Altria (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia. The two own 41 percent of SABMiller. The combination is contentious because the cash-and-share offer is now worth more than the cash bid, though the new shares would have to be held for five years.By splitting the vote, the deal would need backing from up to 85 percent of the shares rather than the 75 percent needed in a unified vote. Altria and Bevco, the Santo Domingo investment vehicle, have already signaled their support. AB InBev and SABMiller shareholder meetings are scheduled for Sept. 28, with completion of the deal expected on Oct. 10 and trading of the yet to be named combined group slated for Oct. 11.The timetable comes after a hectic Friday in which China first gave conditional approval for the merger. The SABMiller  board also recommended acceptance, though it did say the deal was at the lower end of an acceptable range. The deal, the largest ever in the consumer industry, would combine AB InBev's Budweiser, Stella Artois and Corona with SABMiller's Castle Lager and take it into fast-growing African and new Latin American markets.

58,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to  Altria Group, Inc.'s (Altria) senior notes offering. Fitch expects that the  proceeds of the issue will be used to pay down a portion of Altria's currently  outstanding $682 million of 9.95% notes due 2038 and $718 million of 10.20%  notes due 2039, through an ""any and all"" tender offer that is set to expire on  Sept. 16, unless extended. Any remaining proceeds from the offering are expected  to be used for other general corporate purposes, including voluntary  contributions to Altria's pension plans. The Rating Outlook is Stable. The ratings apply to approximately $13 billion of debt at June 30, 2016. A full  list of current ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS --The secular cigarette decline in the U.S., typically in the range of 3% to 4%  per year, decelerated to less than 1% during 2015, but will likely return closer  to historical levels by 2017. --Altria should continue to generate strong EBITDA margins in the high 40%'s,  even as volume declines resume and pricing improvement moderates due to fewer  macroeconomic tailwinds. --Altria's shareholder-friendly posture is expected to continue through the  ratings horizon, including dividend payouts around 80% (of adjusted EPS)  supplemented with active share repurchasing. Fitch sees the strategy as  manageable at current cash flows and with leverage (total debt to EBITDA)  consistently sustained below 2.0 times (x). --Positive action to current credit ratings is restrained by key factors in the  mature industry, specifically secular volume declines, high litigation exposure,  rising regulatory risks and an accommodative shareholder stance. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for Altria include: --Consolidated revenue increases by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of  between 1%-2% from fiscal year (FY) 2015 to FY2018 as cigarette volume declines  revert closer to historical levels of 3%-4% after moderating in 2015 and 2016. --Consolidated EBITDA and EBITDA margin approximates $8.5 billion and 49.5%,  respectively in 2016. --Total debt to EBITDA increases from 1.4x in 2015 to around 1.5x in 2016, from  a modestly higher debt load partially offset by incremental EBITDA growth. --Modest free cash flow (FCF; operating cash flow, less CAPEX and dividends) in  2016 assuming that Altria makes voluntary pension contributions, followed by a  return to levels between $700 million-$800 million (approximate 4% margin)  annually over the remainder of the forecast period, reflecting annual increases  to dividends and capital intensity maintained around 1%. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future development that may individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action: --Mitigation of negative industry factors with an emphasis on the slowing or  reversal of secular volume declines;  --Altria fully offsetting cigarette volume pressures with meaningful portfolio  diversification, such as alternative smoking products including E-cigarettes; --Significantly reducing litigation risk, most notably the Engle progeny  exposure; --A commitment to a conservative financial strategy demonstrated by lower  dividend payouts and less-aggressive share repurchasing.  Future development that may individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action: --Altria has flexibility to accommodate a more aggressive shareholder-friendly  stance or acquisition activity, but gross debt leverage exceeding 2.5x would  warrant a one-notch downgrade;     --EBITDA pressures arising from greater-than-expected market contraction or a  heightened competitive environment, such that gross debt leverage rises and  stays above 2.5x; --Regulatory decisions immediately banning sale of mentholated cigarettes or  meaningfully increasing state or federal excise taxes on smoking products that  significantly accelerates volume declines; --Substantial changes in the litigation process, whereby legal cases may reach  verdict quicker and/or material adverse judgments significantly increase in  number and amount. CIGARETTE VOLUMES IN DECLINE The secular cigarette decline in the U.S., typically in the range of 3% to 4%  per year, decelerated to less than 1% during 2015, benefitting from more  disposable income remains in the hands of the smoking population, mainly driven  by falling gas prices. As a result, cigarette consumers smoked more often and  have up-trended to premium cigarettes. While there will be some benefit during  2016 as oil prices remain subdued, Fitch estimates a return to the historical  annual rate of cigarette decline by 2017.  OPERATIONAL LEVERAGE/PRICING DRIVE EARNINGS  Operating leverage, pricing improvement, and moderating cigarette volume  declines drove an increase of 6.2% in operating income in 2015 from a 5.1%  increase in sales, net of excise taxes. This trend has reversed in the first six  months of 2016, partially due to lower volume and higher promotional  investments, offset by higher pricing. Fitch sees EBITDA margins of 49.5% in  2016, but then modestly easing annually as cigarette volume declines revert to  historical levels. HEAVY SHAREHOLDER RETURNS MANAGEABLE Fitch expects Altria to maintain its shareholder-friendly posture through the  ratings horizon, which includes dividend payouts around 80% (of adjusted EPS)  supplemented with active share repurchasing. The company gains flexibility for  heavy shareholder returns from limited acquisition opportunities and light  capital spending Altria increases its dividend yearly by 8% to 9% (currently  topping $4 billion) and spends around $1 billion for share repurchases that is  determined annually. Fitch sees the strategy as manageable at current cash flows  and with leverage (total debt to EBITDA) consistently sustained below 2.0x. Capital Structure Well Managed: Altria has worked down $8.3 billion of high  coupon notes (due in 2018, 2019, 2038, and 2039) issued for the U.S. Tobacco  (UST) acquisition in 2009. Since 2012, the company re-financed and tendered for  nearly $4.9 billion of the expensive debt, leaving a balance of approximately  $3.4 billion as of June 30, 2016. This total could be reduced by $1 billion or  more once the company's current tender offer is completed. As such, Altria's  weighted average interest rate on its debt, all fixed rate, decreased to 5.5% in  2015 from 8.3% in 2011, and will likely decrease further once the company's  current refinancing transactions are completed. The company also chose to pay  off $1 billion maturing debt in 2015 as opposed to refinancing the notes,  yielding total debt of $12.9 billion on June 30, 2016 (from $14.7 billion at the  end of 2014) and gross debt leverage of 1.4x for the latest 12 months (LTM)  ending June 30, 2016. Fitch expects that leverage will continue to approximate  1.5x over the next few years, as the company maintains financial discipline  while benefiting from strong operational performance. Altria's next significant  long-term debt maturity is the balance of 9.7% unsecured notes ($863.6 million)  due in November 2018. SABMiller Investment Change: Altria's liquidity has been supported by an  approximately 27% ownership in SABMiller plc (SABMiller), valued around $23  billion, that provides annual dividends in the range of $400 million to $500  million. The proposed agreement whereby Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) will  acquire SABMiller in a cash and stock transaction valued at $107 billion will  effectively reduce Altria's ownership to approximately 10.5% of the economic and  voting interest in the combined entity. In addition, Altria will receive $3  billion in cash before taxes from partial share alternative, with the final  ownership stake and cash proceeds subject to proration.  Fitch sees Altria continuing to account for its investment in the merged entity  through the equity method of accounting given board representation and continued  ability to exercise significant influence in the combined company. Fitch sees a  credit neutral impact from the transaction as cash dividends from the new entity  are forecasted to remain relatively steady with present levels despite the  likelihood that the AB InBev-SABMiller firm will reduce dividends to focus on  debt reduction over the intermediate term. INDUSTRY FACTORS LIMIT MOMENTUM Positive action to current credit ratings is restrained by key factors in the  mature industry, specifically secular volume declines, high litigation exposure,  rising regulatory risks and an accommodative shareholder stance. Reversal of  positive price realization for tobacco products such that secular volume  declines are not offset leading to compression in profitability and cash flow  generation would have negative consequences for Altria's ratings. LIQUIDITY Liquidity remains solid at June 30, 2016, with cash of $819 million (near the  annual low point following Philip Morris USA Inc.'s (PM USA) yearly payment to  the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) of approximately $4 billion in April) and  full availability under a $3 billion five-year revolver due August 2020.  Internal liquidity is provided by strong operating cash flows that have  historically increased annually and were $5.6 billion for the LTM period ending  June 30, 2016, versus $5.8 billion in 2015 and $4.66 billion in 2014. Altria's  liquidity is also supported by the company's approximate 27% share of SABMiller,  worth around $23 billion, which provides annual dividends in the range of $400  million to $500 million. The current holding may convert to a 10.5% ownership in  an AB InBev-SABMiller merged entity, potentially the world's largest brewer, in  the near term. Excess liquidity is important given PM USA's annual payment to  the MSA. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch currently rates Altria as follows: Altria Group Inc.

61,"   By Martinne Geller and Philip Blenkinsop | LONDON/BRUSSELS  LONDON/BRUSSELS SABMiller SAB.L shareholders overwhelmingly backed the brewer's $100 billion-plus takeover by Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) on Wednesday, clearing the last big hurdle for one of the largest corporate mergers in history. The combined group will sell more than a quarter of all beers sold worldwide and be the fifth largest consumer goods company. For the maker of Budweiser, Corona and Stella Artois it provides entry into Africa and large fast-growing Latin American markets such as Colombia and Peru. It will also cut its revenue from mature markets North America and Europe to 37 from 47 percent.AB InBev's 79 billion pound  ($102.85 billion) bid passed in a meeting at a London Park Lane hotel lasting less than half an hour, overseen by Chairman Jan du Plessis, who fielded only two questions from shareholders. It secured support representing 95.5 percent of SABMiller share value, having needed at least 75 percent to succeed.In an earlier meeting in Brussels, AB InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito said the new entity would continue to be called Anheuser-Busch InBev, eschewing any corporate reference to SABMiller, founded 120 years ago in South Africa. The brewer had changed its name after transformative deals in the past, such as InBev's 2008 takeover of Anheuser-Busch. ""They can call it what they wish. That's the way life works and that's fine,"" du Plessis told reporters after the meeting. ""It's what it is.""  He added that AB InBev were paying ""a full price"".    NOT A GIVEN  The approval of SAB shareholders was widely expected, but not a given. Criticism of the takeover offer grew after a steep fall in sterling following Britain's vote to leave the European Union made AB InBev's cash offer less appealing.  Activist shareholders pressured SAB to seek a higher offer, prompting AB InBev to sweeten its bid in July.SAB backed the higher offer, and its two largest shareholders, cigarette maker Altria Group (MO.N) and the Santo Domingo family of Colombia, who together control about 40 percent of the shares, gave their support and did not vote on Wednesday. However, some prominent shareholders, including Aberdeen Asset Management, continued to oppose it.""We are obviously disappointed with, but not surprised by, the result,"" Aberdeen said in a statement, adding it felt the final price still ""significantly undervalued"" SABMiller.  Despite hedge funds piling into the stock over the summer in the hope of a higher offer, Thomson Reuters data showed just six hedge funds with a collective investment of $211 million remained shareholders as the deal crossed the line. The lion's share of that, $199 million, was held by New York-based Soroban Capital, with smaller positions held by HBK Investments, Platinum Capital Management, Elliott Management, Farallon Capital Management and Davidson Kempner Capital.Cost-conscious AB InBev expects to extract at least $1.4 billion in annual cost savings after four years, it said, in addition to the $1.05 billion already announced by SABMiller. Given the company's history of easily beating such targets, broker Jefferies sees it achieving $3 billion in savings.The new company will sell off joint venture stakes in the United States and China, to satisfy antitrust regulators, divest Peroni and Grolsch and kick off a sale process for SAB's central and eastern European brands, estimated to be worth up to 7 billion euros.Still, competition in individual markets will not change radically as the two companies have little geographic overlap.

65,"   By Martinne Geller, Paul Sandle and Pamela Barbaglia | LONDON  LONDON British American Tobacco (BATS.L) has offered to buy out U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc (RAI.N) in a $47 billion takeover that would create the world's biggest listed tobacco company with brands including Newport, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.The cash-and-stock deal would mark the return of BAT to the lucrative and highly regulated U.S. market after a 12-year absence, making it the only tobacco giant with a leading presence in American and international markets. It would also give the British company - which has been bolstered by a strong share price since the country voted to leave the European Union - more premium brands such as Camel which it can sell in countries like Russia and Turkey where demand for Western cigarettes is still growing.The marriage would also unite each company's efforts in the fast-developing world of e-cigarettes, which the companies say are less dangerous than smoking - a habit that kills about six million people worldwide each year. BAT shares closed down almost 2.9 percent, while Reynolds was up almost 7 percent in afternoon trading in New York.Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck said the BAT decline could be because ""the price looks rich to us.""  ""Our take is that it is a little bit over valued,"" he said.  Moody’s also said Friday it is reviewing BAT's A3 ratings for a possible downgrade.""Our decision to place BAT's ratings on review for downgrade recognizes that, while the acquisition will enhance BAT's business profile, it could lead to a significant deterioration in BAT's credit metrics,"" says Ernesto Bisagno a Moody's Vice President and lead analyst for BAT.A Reynolds takeover by BAT, which already owns 42 percent of the U.S. group, has long been seen as part of an inevitable wave of global consolidation in a mature industry. Yet the timing, less than three weeks before a U.S. presidential election, was unexpected.""This proposed deal manages to be both entirely expected and a surprise,"" Euromonitor analyst Shane MacGuill said. The completion of last year's purchase by Reynolds of Lorillard, which gave it the popular Newport brand, and the current relative valuations of the two companies' shares were the main reasons the deal was resurrected in recent weeks, said three sources close to the situation. ""It moved very quickly on the back of the falling pound,"" said one of the sources, who all declined to be named in discussing private matters. A final decision was made this week, they said.A 12 percent rise in BAT's shares since Britons opted for Brexit in June, and a 7 percent fall for Reynolds, brought the companies' trading multiples closer together, making a deal more affordable, the sources said. The move increased the value of the share element of the offer for the U.S. shareholders of Reynolds, even as it made the cash portion more costly for the UK company. But one source likened the deal to simplifying Reynolds's structure by removing the stake it does not own. ""It's always been on the cards,"" he said.After the Brexit vote, shares in BAT soared to all-time highs as investors bet the falling pound would lift the value of overseas revenue. BAT, whose share appreciation is less pronounced in dollar terms, does the vast majority of its  business outside the country. It has over 200 brands in over 200 markets.The pound has lost about a fifth of its value against the dollar since the EU referendum on June 23.With little geographic overlap and therefore limited antitrust issues, this deal is also a lot simpler than another oft-speculated deal - that BAT would take over British rival Imperial Brands (IMB.L), the source added.Imperial shares were up 2 percent on Friday, with one analyst saying a general reignition of consolidation in the industry may be outweighing the fact that BAT is now unlikely to bid for its rival in the near term.Altria Group (MO.N) shares were up 4 percent in New York, boosted by hopes that an enlarged BAT would push Swiss-based market leader Philip Morris International (PM.N) to reunite with the U.S. company. The Marlboro maker split into two in 2008, when the risk of litigation in the United States was seen as a deterrent to foreign companies.CASH AND STOCK  Reynolds, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, acknowledged receipt of the unsolicited offer. This was made public immediately after BAT's approach to the Reynolds board, as required by U.S. securities regulators in cases where the buyer is a big shareholder. Reynolds said it would review the offer and respond in due course.The British group said its offer valued Reynolds's shares at $56.50, of which $24.13 would be in cash and $32.37 would be in BAT shares, representing a premium of 20 percent over the closing price of Reynolds stock on Thursday. On Friday afternoon Reynolds shares, at $53.73, were below the offer price.  Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she expected Reynolds to push for a higher price than the $47 billion BAT is offering for the remaining 57.8 percent of the company. Under the offer, $20 billion would be in cash and $27 billion in BAT shares.One source estimated that BAT valued Reynolds's shares at 16.3 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), higher than what Reynolds paid for Lorillard.BAT Chief Executive Nicandro Durante, a long-distance runner who hails from Sao Paolo, Brazil, said the deal would create a U.S. market leader and the world's largest listed tobacco company by net turnover and operating profit.""The strategic rationale makes perfect sense,"" Guy Ellison, an analyst at Investec Wealth & Investment, said. He cited a BAT  pivot toward the large U.S. market - whose profit pool is protected by high barriers to entry - and improved scale in vapor products like e-cigarettes, which all big tobacco companies are investing in to offset declines in smoking. BAT said the deal would add to earnings in the first year after closure and estimated cost savings of about $400 million. It is contingent on approval from independent members of the Reynolds board who were not nominated by BAT.COMING TO AMERICA The recent strength of BAT's share price is also due to geopolitical uncertainty leading investors to seek out stable, dividend-yielding stocks like tobacco and other consumer staples. Shares in Reynolds fell to a 12-month low on Wednesday of $43.38 after its third quarter earnings were 6 percent short of market forecasts, Jefferies analysts said, on the back of a 1.5 percent fall in domestic cigarette volumes.  If successful, the takeover would be one of the biggest this year globally. Including debt, this would be the largest UK outbound M&A deal this year and the fourth largest of all-time, according to Reuters data.BAT stopped operating in the United States in 2004, when it merged its U.S. subsidiary Brown & Williamson with R.J. Reynolds to form Reynolds American. Due to a series of high-profile U.S. lawsuits against tobacco firms, the big four have all limited their exposure to the market. Yet several cases have now been settled, which has led analysts to speculate that international players could return.Imperial Brands waded into the U.S. market last year with its $7 billion purchase of certain brands from Reynolds to ease the $25 billion purchase of Lorillard.  Smoking rates in the United States and other western markets are declining due to increasing health consciousness, and greater regulation and taxes. Yet their addictive nature and high profit margins make them a profitable business.BAT is being advised by Centerview, Deutsche Bank and UBS.BAT also said on Friday it had performed well in the first nine months of the year, raising both revenue at constant rates of exchange and cigarette volumes. Year-to-date revenue grew 8.1 percent at constant rates of exchange, it said, as its biggest brands sold 9.8 percent more cigarettes.
