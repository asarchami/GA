2,"  (Repeat for additional subscribers)May 22 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings assigns a credit rating of 'BBB' to the EUR500 million aggregate principal amount of guaranteed notes issued by Prologis, L.P., the operating partnership of Prologis, Inc. (NYSE: PLD; collectively including rated subsidiaries Prologis or the company). The 2026 notes have an annual coupon rate of 3% and were priced at 99.138% of the  principal amount to yield 3.087% to maturity or 125 basis points (bps) over the  mid-swap rate.The notes are senior unsecured obligations of Prologis, L.P. that are fully and  unconditionally guaranteed by Prologis, Inc. The company intends to use the net  proceeds of approximately EUR493.2 million for the redemption of $182 million of  5.625% notes due November 15, 2016. The company will use the remaining net  proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment or  repurchase other indebtedness. In the short term, Prologis intends to use the  net proceeds to repay borrowings under its multi-currency senior term loan.In addition to the 2026 notes, Fitch currently rates Prologis as follows:Prologis, Inc.--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB';--$100 million preferred stock 'BB+'.Prologis, L.P.--IDR 'BBB'; --$2 billion global senior credit facility 'BBB';--$6.2 billion senior unsecured notes 'BBB';--$460 million senior unsecured exchangeable notes 'BBB'.Prologis Tokyo Finance Investment Limited Partnership--JPY45 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB';--JPY10 billion senior unsecured term loan 'BBB'.The Rating Outlook is Stable.KEY RATING DRIVERS Prologis, Inc.'s 'BBB' IDR reflects leverage that remains elevated for the  rating though expected to decline principally via improving property  fundamentals. The rating is supported by the stable cash flow from the company's  global industrial real estate portfolio that contributes towards appropriate  fixed-charge coverage, strong asset quality, and excellent access to capital.Development continues to be a core tenet for the company and Prologis endeavors  to match-fund acquisitions and development expenditures with proceeds from  dispositions and fund contributions, a strategy that can materially impact  corporate liquidity. Contingent liquidity is strong as measured by unencumbered  asset coverage of unsecured debt.High Leverage for 'BBB'; Expected to DeclineCurrent leverage is high for a 'BBB' rating (8.1x pro rata in the first quarter  of 2014 [1Q'14]), but Fitch's base case forecasts that pro rata leverage will  approach 7x by year-end 2014 and 6.5x by year-end 2015, which would be strong  for the 'BBB' rating. However, the decline in leverage may be choppy  sequentially as the timing of dispositions and fund contributions may not match  that of acquisitions and development starts. Fitch defines leverage as net debt to recurring operating EBITDA on a pro rata  basis given PLD's willingness to buy back and/or recapitalize unconsolidated  assets and its agnostic view towardsproperty management for consolidated and unconsolidated assets. Fitch's  methodology differs from that of PLD's, which also seeks to adjust for the  effects of the development business by either including gains on dispositions  and contributions or adjusting EBITDA to reflect future NOI contributions. In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which same store net operating  income (SSNOI) declines by levels experienced in 2009 - 2010, leverage would  exceed 8x, which would be weak for a 'BBB' rating.Improving Operating Fundamentals and Cash Flow Support Fixed Charge Coverage  The vast majority of PLD's earnings are derived from property-level net  operating income (NOI), which is complemented by the company's investment  management income. During 1Q'14, cash SSNOI increased by 4.1%  as compared to  1.6% on average for 2013 and net effective rents on leases signed in the quarter  increased 7.0% from in-place rents, a leading indicator for 2014 SSNOI growth.Approximately 8.7% of pro rata base rents expire during the remainder of 2014  followed by 18.9% in 2015, and the current strength of the industrial real  estate market allows such expirations to be an opportunity for additional  growth. Fitch expects PLD's SSNOI growth will be 3% in 2014 followed by similar  growth in 2015 based largely on positive net absorption. Operating portfolio  occupancy was 94.5% as of March 31, 2014, slightly down from 95.1% as of Dec.  31, 2013 and consistent with seasonal patterns but up from 93.7% as of March 31,  2013.Pro forma for the issuance of the EUR500 million 3% senior notes due 2026,  redemption of 5.625% notes due 2016, repayment of borrowings under the unsecured  global line of credit and multicurrency unsecured term loan, 1Q'14 pro rata  fixed-charge coverage is appropriate for the 'BBB' rating would have been 2.0x  (2.1x in 1Q'14) compared with 1.8x in 4Q'13 and 1.9x in 3Q'13. Fitch defines pro  rata fixed-charge coverage as pro rata recurring operating EBITDA less pro rata  recurring capital expenditures less straight-line rent adjustments divided by  pro rata interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.Fitch's base case anticipates that coverage will approach 2.5x over the next  12-to-24 months due to expected SSNOI growth, which is strong for the 'BBB'  rating.Global PlatformThe company's large platform ($51.1 billion of assets under management at March  31, 2014) limits the effects of any one region's fundamentals to the overall  cash flows. PLD derived 83.0% of its 1Q'14 NOI from Prologis-defined global  markets (58.1% in the Americas, 19.6% in Europe, and 5.3% in Asia).Private Capital SimplificationThe company has reduced the total number of co-investment vehicles that it  manages via consolidation and the purchase of assets upon closed end fund  expirations. The majority of funds are infinite life, which eliminates take-out  risk at the fund's maturity. In addition, the fund platform provides an  additional layer of fee income and recurring cash distributions to cover PLD's  fixed charges. Recently formed ventures include Prologis China Logistics Venture  2 with HIP China Logistics Investments Limited and Prologis U.S. Logistics  Venture (USLV) with Norges Bank Investment Management. Strong Asset QualityPLD has a high-quality portfolio as evidenced by a focus on properties with  proximity to ports or intermodal yards, cross-docking capabilities and  structural items such as tall clearance heights. The portfolio has limited  tenant concentration which is a credit strength, with only the top three tenants  comprising more than 1% of annual base rent (ABR). PLD's top tenants at March  31, 2014 were DHL (2.2% of ABR), CEVA Logistics (1.4% of ABR), and Kuehne &  Nagel (1.2% of ABR).Excellent Capital AccessThe company's access to capital is strong as evidenced by the diversified  capital structure which includes secured and unsecured debt from public and  private sources, as well as preferred stock, common and private equity capital.Prologis completed a total of $17.5 billion of capital markets activity in 2013  and $1.2 billion of debt financings and refinancings in 1Q'14, including the  issuance of EUR700 million of Eurobonds. Additionally, the company redeemed  $194.2 million of U.S. senior notes and repaid $239.3 million of secured debt.  The company established an ATM program during 2013 through which it may issue up  to $750 million of common stock, though it has yet to utilize this program.Proactive Liability ManagementIn addition to recent U.S. dollar and Euro denominated bond offerings, tender  offers, and debt repurchases, Prologis upsized its global credit facility in  July 2013 to $2 billion from $1.65 billion and improved all-in pricing to LIBOR  plus 130 bps, a reduction of 40 bps from the prior global credit facility. The  company also recast its Japan revolver in 2013, upsizing this facility to JPY45  billion from JPY36.5 billion.Risks & Returns of DevelopmentDevelopment is a core tenet of PLD's business model, and through multiple  property cycles, Prologis has developed over a thousand properties at  mid-to-high teen percentage margins. Development improves the quality of the  portfolio, creates value via the entitlement, construction and leaseup of new  properties and enables PLD to realize cash gains on the contribution of the  stabilized developments to managed funds.Credit concerns related to development include the effects on corporate  liquidity and inherent cyclicality. As evidenced by the past downturn, when  leasing is insufficient to meet occupancy stabilization levels required for  contribution, partially stabilized developments remain on PLD's balance sheet  and are initially funded with short-term debt at the REIT, thus increasing  leverage and reducing corporate liquidity. Partially mitigating the aforementioned risks is the fact that the total  development pipeline is significantly smaller at approximately $1.9 billion at  March 31, 2014 versus $6 billion (including legacy ProLogis and AMB Property  Corporation) at Dec. 31, 2007. The pipeline's size is large on an absolute basis  but manageable on a relative basis as PLD's share of cost to complete  development represented 2.6% of pro rata gross assets as of March 31, 2014.However, the pipeline entails moderate lease-up risk as build-to-suit projects  represented approximately 38.9% of development starts for first-quarter 2014. In  addition, in May 2014, the company announced that it will develop three  inventory logistics facilities totaling 3.2 million square feet near Tokyo, all  of which are speculative projects.The pipeline should remain active in the coming years due to industrial real  estate supply-demand dynamics. Demand for industrial REIT space is skewed toward  larger and newer facilities from tenants such as e-commerce companies,  traditional retailers, and third-party logistics providers.Match-Funded Liquidity StrategyFitch base case liquidity coverage is strong for the rating at 1.7x for the  period April 1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2015. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as  liquidity sources divided by uses. Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash,  availability under revolving credit facilities pro forma for the 2026 notes  offering, and projected retained cash flows from operating activities. Liquidity  uses include pro rata debt maturities after extension options at PLD's option  and projected recurring capital expenditures.Liquidity coverage would be 1.3x when including dispositions and contributions  as liquidity sources and acquisitions and development starts as liquidity uses.  Assuming an 80% refinance rate on upcoming secured debt maturities, liquidity  coverage would be 1.6x. As of March 31, 2014 near-to-medium term debt maturities  are staggered; 4.0% of pro rata debt matures during the remainder of 2014,  followed by 9.9% in 2015.Prologis has strong contingent liquidity as unencumbered assets (1Q'14 estimated  unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed 8% capitalization rate) cover pro forma  unsecured debt by 2.6x. When applying a stressed 50% haircut to the book value  of land and 25% haircut to construction in progress, pro forma unencumbered  asset coverage improves to a strong 2.8x. However, the company's AFFO payout  ratio was 97.3% in 1Q'14 and 95.4% in 2013, indicating limited liquidity  generated from operating cash flow after dividends.Preferred Stock NotchingThe two-notch differential between PLD's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB'.  Based on Fitch research titled 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's web site  at 'www.fitchratings.com', these preferred securities are deeply subordinated  and have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in  the event of a corporate default.Stable OutlookThe Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that leverage will remain  between 7.0x and 8.0x over the next 12 months, offset by liquidity coverage of  above 1.0x and fixed-charge coverage of around 2.0x over the next 12 months.RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum in the rating and/or  Outlook:--Fitch's expectation of pro rata leverage sustaining below 6.5x (pro rata  leverage was 8.1x in 1Q'14);--Liquidity coverage including development sustaining above 1.25x (Fitch base  case liquidity coverage is 1.7x, but 1.3x when including dispositions and  contributions as liquidity sources and acquisitions and development starts as  liquidity uses);--Fitch's expectation of pro rata fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 2.0x  (pro rata coverage was 2.0x in 1Q'14 pro forma).The following factors may result in negative momentum in the rating and/or  Outlook:--Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 7.5x;--Liquidity coverage including development sustaining below 1.0x;--Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage ratio sustaining below 1.5x.",2014-05-22,PLD,"Thu May 22, 2014 | 9:23am EDT","RPT-Fitch Rates Prologis, L.P.'s EUR500MM 3% Notes Due 2026 'BBB'; Outlook Stable",http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-rates-prologis-lps-eur500mm-3-note-idUSFit70203420140522?type=companyNews

The trusts, known locally as fibras, issue certificates that function much like shares and allow investors to participate in Mexico's property market without owning buildings. Mexico saw a record level of IPOs in 2013, but momentum did not carry over into the new year because emerging markets worldwide were hit by sell-offs.

4,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the credit ratings for  Prologis, Inc. (NYSE: PLD) and its rated subsidiaries as follows: Prologis, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB';     --$78.2 million preferred stock at 'BB+'. Prologis, L.P. --IDR at 'BBB';     --$2.5 billion global senior credit facility at 'BBB';     --$5.6 billion senior unsecured notes at 'BBB';     --$460 million senior unsecured exchangeable notes at 'BBB'; --EUR500 million multi-currency senior unsecured term loan at 'BBB'. Prologis Tokyo Finance Investment Limited Partnership --JPY45 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB'. --JPY40.9 billion senior unsecured term loan at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The Positive Outlook reflects the material improvement in the company's  liquidity position, increasing cash flow in excess of fixed charges, reflecting  strong property fundamentals and the expectation that leverage will decline to  levels commensurate with a 'BBB+' IDR.  Prologis reduced leverage over the past  year by growing EBITDA and repaying debt with proceeds from asset sales and  contributions to co-investment ventures.  However, leverage remains high for the  'BBB' rating (pro-rata 7.5x in second quarter 2014 [2Q'14] and 7.8x for the  trailing 12 months (TTM) ended June 30, 2014, due in part to the company's land  holdings).     Credit strengths include strong asset quality, excellent access to capital, and  a global platform with diversification by location and tenant.  Prologis has  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt.  The main credit  concerns are the high leverage and the continued increase in the company's  speculative development pipeline which results in elevated lease-up risk.  Material Improvement in Liquidity; Change in Strategy Prologis improved its liquidity position over the past year and Fitch expects  PLD will seek to maintain sufficient liquidity before considering proceeds from  dispositions and contributions. While Fitch expects PLD will continue to match  fund its development expenditures with dispositions and contributions,  maintaining sufficient liquidity before the match-funding reduces the risks to  unsecured bondholders during periods of capital markets dislocation.  The company's liquidity coverage ratio improved to 1.2x for the period July 1,  2014 to Dec. 31, 2016 from 0.8x a year prior as a result of multiple bond  offerings and increased availability under the bank facility agreements, despite  the offsetting effect of using some of the proceeds to tender for longer dated  bonds.  Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by uses  for the period July 1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2016. Liquidity sources include  unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit facilities pro forma for  the repurchase of 2017-2018 notes in July 2014, and projected retained cash  flows from operating activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities  after extension options at PLD's option, projected recurring capital  expenditures, and pro rata cost to complete development.  Under a scenario by  which the company's 3.25% exchangeable debentures convert to equity in 2015,  liquidity coverage would improve to 1.5x. On a pro forma basis, only 0.4% of pro rata debt matures for the remainder of  2014, followed by 8.5% in 2015 and 8.1% in 2016.  Internally generated liquidity  is moderate as the company's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio  was 83.5% in 2Q'14, down from 95.4% in full year 2013.  Based on the current  payout ratio, the company would retain approximately $130 million in annual cash  flow.  Improving Fundamentals and Fixed-Charge Coverage Positive net absorption continues to benefit PLD's portfolio while macro  industrial indicators such as manufacturing levels, housing starts and  homebuilder confidence indicate that demand may continue to outpace supply.  The  company's average net effective rent change on rollover was 6.4% for the TTM  ended June 30, 2014, up from 4.5% on average in 2013.  Average occupancy also  increased to 94.5% for the TTM ended June 30, 2014 from 94.1% on average for  2013, and cash same-store net operating income (NOI) grew by 3.6% on average for  the TTM ended June 30, 2014, up from 1.6% on average in 2013.   Pro rata fixed-charge coverage (FCC) was 2.4x in 2Q'14 (2.1x TTM), up from 1.8x  in 2013.  Fitch defines pro rata FCC as pro rata recurring operating EBITDA less  pro rata recurring capital expenditures less straight-line rent adjustments  divided by pro rata interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.   Fitch projects that a minor increase in occupancy and rental rate growth in the  high single digits (since in-place rents over the next several years remain  approximately 10% below market rents) will result in 3%-4% same store NOI  (SSNOI) growth over the next several years.  This should result in FCC  sustaining in the 2.5x to 3.0x range, which is appropriate for a 'BBB+' rating. High Leverage Expected to Decline PLD's 7.5x pro rata debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of June 30, 2014 is high for the  'BBB' rating.  Fitch projects that pro rata leverage will decline through 2016  to approximately 6.5x due primarily to SSNOI growth.  Fitch's leverage threshold  of 6.5x for a 'BBB+' rating for Prologis acknowledges the company's strong asset  quality and lower portfolio yields.  Pro Rata Treatment Fitch looks primarily at pro rata leverage (pro rata net debt-to-pro rata  recurring operating EBITDA) rather than consolidated metrics given Fitch's  expectation that PLD has and would in the future support or recapitalize  unconsolidated entities, its agnostic view toward property management for  consolidated and unconsolidated assets, and its focus on pro rata portfolio and  debt metrics. As a supplementary measure, Fitch calculates consolidated leverage  as consolidated net debt-to-consolidated recurring operating EBITDA plus Fitch's  estimate of recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated co-investment  ventures, since these cash distributions benefit unsecured bondholders.   However, this supplementary measure may understate leverage given the inclusion  of cash distributions from joint ventures but exclusion of the corresponding  non-recourse debt. Fitch does not expect Prologis to take any of the  co-investment ventures' assets or debt onto its balance sheet over the next  several years.   Excellent Access to Capital The company issued $9 billion in unsecured bonds since 2009 (using the proceeds  to refinance and repurchase bonds) and $3.7 billion of follow-on common equity  at a weighted average discount of 1.8% to consensus estimated net asset value.   The company also has a $750 million at-the-market equity offering program,  though it has yet to utilize this program.  Debt issuance volumes have been  particularly strong over the past year as the company has issued EUR1.9 billion  and $1.75 billion of bonds since August 2013.  Strategic capital is another important source of funding for PLD.  In 2014, PLD  formed Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture with Norway's sovereign wealth fund NBIM  (the second venture between NBIM and Prologis following the formation of  Prologis European Logistics Partners Sarl in 2013). Strategic capital raises  also include publicly traded vehicles (FIBRA Prologis and Nippon Prologis REIT).  The company rationalized and restructured certain of its investment ventures to  increase the permanency of its capital and reduce the inter-dependence over the  past several years, which Fitch views favorably. Global Platform Prologis had $51.6 billion of assets under management as of June 30, 2014 and  the global platform limits the risk of over-exposure to any one region's  fundamentals. PLD derived 83.3% of its 2Q'14 NOI from Prologis-defined global  markets (56.2% in the Americas, 21.8% in Europe, and 5.3% in Asia), and the  remaining 16.7% of 2Q'14 NOI was derived from regional and other markets.  The  portfolio generally has proximity to ports or intermodal yards, cross-docking  capabilities and structural items such as tall clearance heights.  The portfolio has limited tenant concentration, which is a credit strength, as  only the top four tenants comprise more than 1% of annual base rent (ABR). PLD's  top tenants at March 31, 2014 were DHL (2.1% of ABR), CEVA Logistics (1.4% of  ABR), Kuehne & Nagel (1.3% of ABR) and Geodis (1.2% of ABR). Adequate Unencumbered Asset Coverage  Prologis has adequate contingent liquidity with unencumbered assets (2Q'14  unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed 8% capitalization rate) to unsecured debt  of 2.0x. When applying a stressed 50% haircut to the book value of land held and  a 25% haircut to construction in progress, unencumbered asset coverage improves  to 2.2x. Increasing Speculative Development  PLD's strategy of developing industrial properties centers on value creation and  complements the company's core business of collecting rent from owned assets.  After construction and stabilization, the company either holds such assets on  its balance sheet or contributes them to managed co-investment ventures. PLD  endeavors to match-fund development expenditures and acquisitions with cash from  dispositions or contributions of assets to the ventures.  If the company does  not anticipate disposition or contribution volumes, PLD management has stated  that the company would scale back development starts and acquisitions  accordingly, though the sector has a mixed track record of forecasting market  cycles. Fitch views PLD's improved focus on risk management related to its business,  including development (i.e. Prologis Integrated Risk Index) favorably.  Development is substantially smaller today with total expected investment (TEI)  at 9.1% of undepreciated assets at June 30, 2014 versus 31.8% at year-end 2007  (ProLogis and AMB Property Corporation pro forma).  Costs to complete are 3.7%  of undepreciated assets at June 30, 2014 (2.8% pro rata) compared with 14.1% at  year-end 2007.  However, speculative development increased post-merger to 82.4%  at June 30, 2014 from 58.2% in 2013 and 43.2% in 2012, which illustrates  elevated lease-up risk.   Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between PLD's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis' criteria report dated Dec. 23, 2013, as  PLD's preferred securities have cumulative coupon deferral options exercisable  by PLD and thus have readily triggered loss-absorption provisions in a going  concern. Prologis Tokyo Finance Investment Limited Partnership  Fitch has assigned a senior unsecured guaranteed notes rating of 'BBB' to  Prologis Tokyo Finance Investment Limited Partnership, which is a wholly-owned  subsidiary of Prologis, Inc.  Prologis, Inc. and Prologis, L.P. guarantee the  obligations of Prologis Tokyo Finance Investment Limited Partnership. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in a ratings upgrade to 'BBB+': --Fitch's expectation of pro rata leverage sustaining below 6.5x is Fitch's  primary rating sensitivity (pro rata leverage was 7.5x in 2Q'14 and 7.8x TTM); --Fitch's expectation of consolidated leverage sustaining below 6x (consolidated  leverage was 6.1x in 2Q'14 and 6.5x TTM. Fitch defines consolidated leverage as  net debt to recurring operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions  from unconsolidated entities to Prologis);  --Fitch's expectation of liquidity coverage sustaining above 1.25x (this ratio  is 1.2x for the period July 1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2016 but improves to 1.5x under  a scenario by which the company's 3.25% exchangeable debentures convert to  equity in 2015); --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining above 2x (this ratio was 2.4x in 2Q'14  and 2.1x TTM); The following factors may result in negative action on the ratings and/or Rating  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of pro rata leverage sustaining above 7.5x; --Fitch's expectation of consolidated leverage sustaining above 7.0x; --Fitch's expectation of liquidity coverage sustaining below 1.0x; --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining below 1.5x.

5,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings assigns a credit rating of 'BBB' to  the EUR600 million aggregate principal amount of guaranteed notes issued by  Prologis, L.P., the operating partnership of Prologis, Inc. (NYSE: PLD;  collectively including rated subsidiaries Prologis or the company).  The 2020  notes have an annual coupon rate of 1.375% and were priced at 99.834% of the  principal amount to yield 1.404% to maturity or 85 basis points (bps) over the  mid-swap rate. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of Prologis, L.P. that are fully and  unconditionally guaranteed by Prologis, Inc. The company intends to use the net  proceeds of approximately EUR596.9 million for general corporate purposes,  including the acquisition and development of European properties and additional  investments in European co-investment ventures. In the short term, Prologis  intends to use the net proceeds to repay borrowings under its global line of  credit and/or multi-currency senior term loan. In addition to the 2020 notes, Fitch currently rates Prologis as follows: Prologis, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB'; --$78.2 million preferred stock 'BB+'. Prologis, L.P. --IDR 'BBB'; --$2.5 billion global senior credit facility 'BBB'; --$5.6 billion senior unsecured notes 'BBB'; --$460 million senior unsecured exchangeable notes 'BBB'; --EUR500 million multi-currency senior unsecured term loan 'BBB'. Prologis Tokyo Finance Investment Limited Partnership --Senior unsecured guaranteed notes 'BBB'; --JPY45 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB'; --JPY40.9 billion senior unsecured term loan 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Positive. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Positive Outlook reflects the material improvement in the company's  liquidity position, increasing cash flow in excess of fixed charges, reflecting  strong property fundamentals and the expectation that leverage will decline to  levels commensurate with a 'BBB+' IDR. Prologis reduced leverage over the past  year by growing EBITDA and repaying debt with proceeds from asset sales and  contributions to co-investment ventures. However, leverage remains high for the  'BBB' rating (pro rata 7.5x in second quarter 2014 [2Q'14] and 7.8x for the  trailing 12 months (TTM) ended June 30, 2014, due in part to the company's land  holdings). Credit strengths include strong asset quality, excellent access to capital, and  a global platform with diversification by location and tenant. Prologis has  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt. The main credit concerns  are the high leverage and the continued increase in the company's speculative  development pipeline which results in elevated lease-up risk. Material Improvement in Liquidity; Change in Strategy Prologis improved its liquidity position over the past year and Fitch expects  the company will seek to maintain sufficient liquidity before considering  proceeds from dispositions and contributions. While Fitch expects PLD will  continue to match-fund its development expenditures with dispositions and  contributions, maintaining sufficient liquidity before the match-funding reduces  the risks to unsecured bondholders during periods of capital markets  dislocation. The company's liquidity coverage ratio improved to 1.3x for the period July 1,  2014 to Dec. 31, 2016 from 0.8x a year prior as a result of multiple bond offerings and increased  availability under the bank facility agreements, despite the offsetting effect  of using some of the proceeds to tender for longer dated bonds. Fitch defines  liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by uses for the period July 1,  2014 to Dec. 31, 2016. Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability  under revolving credit facilities pro forma for the repurchase of 2017-2018  notes in July 2014 and senior notes due 2020, and projected retained cash flows  from operating activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities after  extension options at PLD's option, projected recurring capital expenditures, and  pro rata cost to complete development. Under a scenario by which the company's  3.25% exchangeable debentures convert to equity in 2015, liquidity coverage  would improve to 1.5x. On a pro forma basis, only 0.4% of pro rata debt matures for the remainder of  2014, followed by 8.5% in 2015 and 8.1% in 2016. Internally generated liquidity is moderate as the  company's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio was 83.5% in 2Q'14,  down from 95.4% in full-year 2013.  Based on the current payout ratio, the  company would retain approximately $130 million in annual cash flow. Improving Fundamentals and Fixed-Charge Coverage Positive net absorption continues to benefit Prologis' portfolio while macro  industrial indicators such as manufacturing levels, housing starts and  homebuilder confidence indicate that demand may continue to outpace supply. The  company's average net effective rent change on rollover was 6.4% for the TTM  ended June 30, 2014, up from 4.5% on average in 2013. Average occupancy also  increased to 94.5% for the TTM ended June 30, 2014 from 94.1% on average for  2013, and cash same-store net operating income (NOI) grew by 3.6% on average for  the TTM ended June 30, 2014, up from 1.6% on average in 2013. Pro rata fixed-charge coverage (FCC) was 2.4x in 2Q'14 (2.1x TTM), up from 1.8x  in 2013. Fitch defines pro rata FCC as pro rata recurring operating EBITDA less  pro rata recurring capital expenditures less straight-line rent adjustments  divided by pro rata interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  Fitch projects that a minor increase in occupancy and rental  rate growth in the high single digits (since in-place rents over the next  several years remain approximately 10% below market rents) will result in 3%-4%  same store NOI (SSNOI) growth over the next several years. This should result in  FCC sustaining in the 2.5x to 3.0x range, which is appropriate for a 'BBB+'  rating. High Leverage Expected to Decline The company's 7.5x pro rata debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of June 30, 2014 is high for  the 'BBB' rating. Fitch projects that pro rata leverage will decline through  2016 to approximately 6.5x due primarily to SSNOI growth. Fitch's leverage  threshold of 6.5x for a 'BBB+' rating for Prologis acknowledges the company's  strong asset quality and lower portfolio yields. Pro Rata Treatment Fitch looks primarily at pro rata leverage (pro rata net debt-to-pro rata  recurring operating EBITDA) rather than consolidated metrics given Fitch's  expectation that PLD has and would in the future support or recapitalize  unconsolidated entities, its agnostic view toward property management for  consolidated and unconsolidated assets, and its focus on pro rata portfolio and  debt metrics. As a supplementary measure, Fitch calculates consolidated leverage as  consolidated net debt-to consolidated recurring operating EBITDA plus Fitch's  estimate of recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated co-investment  ventures, since these cash distributions benefit unsecured bondholders.   However, this supplementary measure may understate leverage given the inclusion  of cash distributions from joint ventures but exclusion of the corresponding  non-recourse debt. Fitch does not expect Prologis to take any of the  co-investment ventures' assets or debt onto its balance sheet over the next  several years. Excellent Access to Capital The company issued $7.1 billion and EUR2.5 billion in unsecured bonds since 2009  (using the proceeds to refinance and repurchase bonds and for general corporate  purposes) and $3.7 billion of follow-on common equity at a weighted average  discount of 1.8% to consensus estimated net asset value. The company also has a  $750 million at-the-market equity offering program, though it has yet to utilize  this program. Debt issuance volumes have been particularly strong over the past  year as the company has issued EUR2.5 billion and $1.75 billion of bonds since  August 2013. Strategic capital is another important source of funding for PLD. In 2014, PLD  formed Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture with Norway's sovereign wealth fund NBIM (the second  venture between NBIM and Prologis following the formation of Prologis European Logistics  Partners Sarl in 2013).  Strategic capital raises also include publicly traded  vehicles (FIBRA Prologis and Nippon Prologis REIT). The company rationalized and  restructured certain of its investment ventures to increase the permanency of  its capital and reduce the inter-dependence over the past several years, which  Fitch views favorably. Global Platform Prologis had $51.6 billion of assets under management as of June 30, 2014 and  the global platform limits the risk of over-exposure to any one region's  fundamentals. PLD derived 83.3% of its 2Q'14 NOI from Prologis-defined global  markets (56.2% in the Americas, 21.8% in Europe, and 5.3% in Asia), and the  remaining 16.7% of 2Q'14 NOI was derived from regional and other markets. The portfolio generally has proximity to ports or intermodal yards,  cross-docking capabilities and structural items such as tall clearance heights.   The portfolio has limited tenant concentration, which is a credit strength, as  only the top four tenants comprise more than 1% of annual base rent (ABR). PLD's  top tenants at March 31, 2014 were DHL (2.1% of ABR), CEVA Logistics (1.4% of  ABR), Kuehne & Nagel (1.3% of ABR) and Geodis (1.2% of ABR). Adequate Unencumbered Asset Coverage Prologis has adequate contingent liquidity with a stressed value of unencumbered  assets (2Q'14 unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed 8% capitalization rate) to  net unsecured debt of 2.0x. When applying a 50% haircut to the book value of  land held and a 25% haircut to construction in progress, unencumbered asset  coverage improves to 2.2x. Increasing Speculative Development PLD's strategy of developing industrial properties centers on value creation and  complements the company's core business of collecting rent from owned assets.  After construction and stabilization, the company either holds such assets on  its balance sheet or contributes them to managed co-investment ventures. PLD  endeavors to match-fund development expenditures and acquisitions with cash from  dispositions or contributions of assets to the ventures. If the company does not  anticipate disposition or contribution volumes, PLD management has stated that  the company would scale back development starts and acquisitions accordingly,  though the sector has a mixed track record of forecasting market cycles. Fitch views PLD's improved focus on risk management related to its business,  including development (i.e. Prologis Integrated Risk Index) favorably.  Development is substantially smaller today with total expected investment (TEI)  at 9.1% of undepreciated assets at June 30, 2014 versus 31.8% at year-end 2007  (ProLogis and AMB Property Corporation pro forma). Costs to complete are 3.7% of  undepreciated assets at June 30, 2014 (2.8% pro rata) compared with 14.1% at  year-end 2007. However, speculative development increased post-merger to 82.4%  at June 30, 2014 from 58.2% in 2013 and 43.2% in 2012, which illustrates  elevated lease-up risk. Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between PLD's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis' criteria report dated Dec. 23, 2013, as  PLD's preferred securities have cumulative coupon deferral options exercisable  by PLD and thus have readily triggered loss-absorption provisions in a going  concern. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in a ratings upgrade to 'BBB+': --Fitch's expectation of pro rata leverage sustaining below 6.5x is Fitch's  primary rating sensitivity (pro rata leverage was 7.5x in 2Q'14 and 7.8x TTM); --Fitch's expectation of consolidated leverage sustaining below 6x (consolidated  leverage was 6.1x in 2Q'14 and 6.5x TTM. Fitch defines consolidated leverage as  net debt to recurring operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions  from unconsolidated entities to Prologis); --Fitch's expectation of liquidity coverage sustaining above 1.25x (this ratio  is 1.3x for the period July 1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2016 but improves to 1.5x under a scenario by which the  company's 3.25% exchangeable debentures convert to equity in 2015); --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining above 2x (this ratio was 2.4x in 2Q'14  and 2.1x TTM). The following factors may result in negative action on the ratings and/or Rating  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of pro rata leverage sustaining above 7.5x; --Fitch's expectation of consolidated leverage sustaining above 7.0x; --Fitch's expectation of liquidity coverage sustaining below 1.0x; --Fitch's expectation of FCC sustaining below 1.5x.

18,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK With Amazon and other e-commerce sites continuing to take market share from malls and other physical retailers, U.S. mutual fund managers are upping their bets on an overlooked part of the online shopping boom: warehouses.Real estate investment trusts (REITs) that own the distribution centers required to fill all those Amazon Prime boxes are a growing favorite on Wall Street after two years of underperformance compared with the broad real estate market. In large part, the move comes about because of changes in the supply chains of online retail giants like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) over the last few years as they focus on fast, two-day shipping. Whereas a traditional retailer might send a pallet full of merchandise to a store, online shippers send out individual packages. That requires significantly more space to hold greater amounts of inventory on hand and to route all those boxes, said Eric Frankel, an analyst at research firm Green Street Advisors. That has allowed companies such as Prologis Inc (PLD.N) - which counts Amazon among its largest customers - to raise rents a record 20.1 percent in the first three months of the year. Even with the rent increases seen this year, warehouse occupancy rates are at their highest since 2000, making rent spikes across the industry likely for newer, modern warehouses near major cities, according to Green Street. ""We think the shift to e-commerce is just going to create more demand for warehouses and while those aren't the sexiest parts of the industry, that's where the demand is,"" said Nate Weisshaar, a portfolio manager at Motley Fool Asset Management. He has been adding to his position in Stag Industrial Inc (STAG.N), a warehouse company whose shares are up 24 percent year-to-date.  Total fund ownership of real estate companies such as Prologis Inc and Duke Realty Corp (DRE.N) has jumped by 30 percent or more over the last quarter, according to Morningstar data. At the same time, their share prices are up 15 percent or more for the year to date, well outpacing the 3-percent gain in the benchmark S&P 500, or the 9.9-percent increase in the Dow Jones All REIT index. ANOTHER CATALYST   The rally in warehouse stocks has sent the shares like Prologis to their highest levels since before the 2008 financial crisis. Some fund managers expect the rally to continue, in part because of a technical change by S&P that will recognize real estate as its own sector, rather than a part of financials. That will require active U.S. equity fund managers - who have traditionally been underweight real estate - to buy more than $100 billion in real estate shares to reach a market neutral position, according to J.P. Morgan. ""You're going to see more adoption of REITs overall, especially on the part of managers who haven't held the sector before, and they're going to gravitate to what they know,"" said Mike Underhill, portfolio manager at RidgeWorth Investments. Underhill estimates Prologis will be among the companies that see the largest inflows as a result of the change because of its connection to the more-familiar consumer discretionary sector. He is also bullish on mid-cap REITs such as DCT Industrial Trust Inc (DCT.N), which has been expanding its urban distribution centers in areas such as Atlanta and Washington DC in order to make it easier to fulfill next-day delivery orders.""These industrial REITs are caught up in the same paradigm shift that's been a negative for bricks and mortar retailers, but on the other side of it,"" he said.
