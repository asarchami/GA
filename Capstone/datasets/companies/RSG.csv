0,"  (Repeat for additional subscribers)Jan 17 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings has placed Tunisia-based construction  group Servicom's National Long- and Short-term ratings of 'B(tun)' on Rating  Watch Negative (RWN). Fitch has also assigned Servicom a senior unsecured rating  of 'B(tun)' and simultaneously placed the rating on RWN.The RWN reflects Servicom's increased leverage in 2013 to a level inconsistent  with its ratings. The business continues to generate negative cash flows,  leaving little scope for de-leveraging over the next two years.Servicom is in the process of raising TND20m of equity, which if successful,  should allow leverage to return to levels more consistent with the current  ratings and provide some buffer to liquidity. Under such a scenario, Fitch  expects funds from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage to improve to around  3x in 2014 from 5.2x forecast for FY13. Additionally, the capital increase will  provide Servicom with funding flexibility for business growth.The capital increase, of which TND9.4m will be through a share offering in the  Tunis Stock Exchange, is subject to the approval of the financial market  authority, Conseil du Marche Financier. The transaction is expected to be closed  in 1Q14. Fitch expects to resolve the RWN once the transaction is completed and  following a full review of Servicom's credit metrics.KEY RATING DRIVERS Increased LeverageFitch expects Servicom's FFO adjusted net leverage to increase to 5.2x at FYE13,  from 3.7x at FYE12, and to remain above 5x if the capital increase is not  successful. If the TND20m capital increase is successful FFO adjusted net  leverage should fall to around 3x in 2014 and remain at 3.5x over the next two  years, levels which are compatible with its current ratings. Under the new  shareholder agreement related to the capital increase, Servicom has committed to  maintain net debt/EBITDA below 2.5x (forecast at 4.2x at FYE13). This commitment  is likely to enforce more disciplined financial management. New Organisation StructureTo accommodate the capital increase, Servicom's founding shareholders have  grouped their interests in a new entity Servicom Holding SA. Servicom Holding SA  owns 53% of Servicom shares and will fund its share of the capital increase  through a contribution from the founding shareholders, the participation of a  local equity fund, Maghreb Private Equity Fund II, and by raising bank debt. The  bank debt at Servicom Holding SA will be on a non-recourse basis to Servicom.  This new shareholding structure will likely force Servicom, from 2015 onwards,  to upstream dividends to repay the bank loan. The Fitch rating case has assumed  a 60% dividend payout ratio starting from 2015, which should cover the bank loan  amortisation. Considering the above, we view the new organisation structure as  neutral to Servicom's ratings.Material Funding Needs Fitch expects continued business growth to generate material funding needs.  Servicom demonstrated strong access to bank funding and debt markets in 2013.  The announced capital increase should support Servicom's funding needs. However,  additional funding requirements may arise if the group is to maintain business  growth over the next three years.Weak LiquidityServicom's cash from operations (CFO) is negative due to high working capital  needs resulting from exposure to the state and state-related entities with long  payment delays but low payment risk.  Receivables collection rose to 357 days in  2012 from 288 days in 2011 and is likely to have remained high in 2013. This is  likely to have kept CFO negative in 2013. According to Fitch's rating base case,  FCF will remain negative over the next two years and refinancing risk high. Fairly Limited Scale/Exposure to TunisiaThe ratings reflect the company's small size in the Tunisian construction sector  (including telecom network deployment) compared with Fitch-rated peers both in  Tunisia and internationally. The business is mainly domestic (90% of revenue)  and geographical diversification is limited despite growing shares in Morocco  and France. Although Fitch views positively Servicom's expansion into these  lower-risk markets, it is not without execution risk.Strong Growth Continues; Resilient PerformanceServicom continues to post strong growth despite a weak economic environment in  Tunisia, benefiting from its niche position in public infrastructure projects.  Revenue is expected by Fitch to have risen to TND47m in 2013 from only TND26m in  2011. Servitra, the subsidiary operating in infrastructure projects, expects  revenue to have grown to TND18m in 2013 from only TND10m in 2011. Fitch expects  Servicom's revenue growth to slow due to the execution risk of overseas  expansion and economic uncertainty in Tunisia.RATING SENSITIVITIES Affirmation of the Servicom's rating is subject to the successful completion of  the capital increase, leading to an improvement in leverage to below 5x and  coverage to above 2x (forecast at 2.2x at FYE13). A failure to complete the  capital increase, resulting in leverage at above 5x and coverage below 2x, and  negative CFO, would be negative for the ratings.",2014-01-17,RSG,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 5:41am EST",RPT-Fitch places Tunisia's Servicom on rating watch negative,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-places-tunisias-servicom-on-rating-idUSFit68448520140117?type=companyNews

9,"  (Repeats to broaden distribution)By Olivia OranNEW YORK, Sept 1 Over the past two years, a growing number of U.S. banks has capped their directors' earnings, but the ceilings are so high that they primarily serve to fend off potential shareholder litigation rather than control the pace of pay increases.Most of the caps are typically 2-3 times what directors now get paid, according to data and filings reviewed by Reuters.For instance, Morgan Stanley's quarterly financial statement last month noted a new $750,000 limit on annual compensation for independent directors. That is more than double the $350,000 median the bank now pays its directors.Morgan Stanley's board has permission to ""alter, amend or modify the plan at any time"", according to the bank's filing.Pay consultants and recruiters say banks need such flexibility because heightened regulatory burdens make positions on bank boards less attractive than in other sectors.Competitive pay can help lure qualified directors who otherwise would choose less time-consuming and highly scrutinized jobs, they say.""The time spent in these type of positions has grown, as has the risk and potential liability,"" said Rose Marie Orens, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.However, advocates of reforming executive pay - by linking it with performance and reducing incentives for risk-taking - argue the pay ceilings are so high they lack teeth.""It doesn't really change the landscape significantly other than insulate companies from lawsuits,"" said Yaron Nili, a law professor at the University of Wisconsin who focuses on corporate governance. Overall, the median annual board compensation at the six biggest U.S. banks was $349,027 in 2015, nearly $80,000 more than the median director pay at S&P 500 companies overall, according to executive compensation data firm Equilar. (Graphic:tmsnrt.rs/2bVXg3x)While regulators scrutinize executive pay at big banks, investors wield the stick when it comes to independent directors' earnings. Several shareholder lawsuits on the issue got banks' attention.In one important case, investors sued waste disposal company Republic Services Inc, accusing directors of paying themselves too much. The judge ruled in 2012 that the company lacked ""meaningful limits"" on director awards.Facebook Inc settled a similar lawsuit in 2014 by agreeing to review director compensation annually and to bring in an independent consultant.No banks have been subject to litigation over director compensation, but have preemptively imposed pay caps to avoid facing similar suits. CONVENIENT PROTECTION ""For the most part, these limits aren't really going to affect director pay, other than the fact that it's really just a protection for them,"" said Bill Gerek who advises companies on executive pay and governance matters at Korn Ferry. ""What's the cost?""Consultants and lawyers say having any ceiling makes a company less likely to be targeted in a lawsuit.Director pay has been rising at banks at a similar pace as at other large companies in recent years. However, the rise in compensation has generally outpaced banks' share performance.From the beginning of 2014 to the end of 2015, the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index rose 5.2 percent compared with a 11 percent rise in the S&P 500 Index. Average director pay at the 10 biggest U.S. banks rose 7 percent during the same period, according to Equilar, which tracks such data. So far this year, the KBW index is roughly steady while the S&P has risen 6.3 percent.Goldman Sachs Group Inc pays its board the most among banks and ranks sixth among S&P 500 companies, according to executive recruiting firm Spencer Stuart. Its directors earned a median annual compensation of $595,000 last year, up 32 percent since 2011.Goldman does not have caps on board pay. The majority of its directors' pay comes in the form of stock whose sales are restricted until several quarters after they retire.A Goldman spokesman declined to comment on director compensation.A Willis Towers Watson analysis of Fortune 500 companies found that about 52 percent of financial institutions now have limits on stock awards directors can receive, compared with 28 percent for the whole 500. The majority of companies have instituted limits just for stock-based awards, while others have targeted overall compensation, including cash.In addition to Morgan Stanley, Citigroup Inc, American Express, US Bancorp and Bank of New York Mellon Corp also have director pay limits. Citigroup's cap of $900,000 on stock awards is more than 2.5 times its current median director pay. Bank of New York Mellon's cap of $1 million is about 3.5 times its median annual compensation.An American Express spokeswoman said the pay caps are good corporate governance. The other banks declined to comment beyond the filings.The greater focus on executive pay means investors also care more about board pay, said Pat McGurn, head of strategic research and analysis at corporate governance firm ISS.Limits on board pay are ""becoming part of the checklist now,"" he said.(Reporting by Olivia Oran in New York; additional reporting by Dan Freed; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Tomasz Janowski)",2016-09-01,RSG,"Thu Sep 1, 2016 | 7:00am EDT","RPT-Fearing lawsuits, U.S. banks set sky-high limits for director pay",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-banks-compensation-idUSL1N1BC2IS?type=companyNews
