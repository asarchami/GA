Analysts, on average, expected the Columbus, Indiana-based company to post a profit $1.98 a share on sales of $4.2 billion, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.While weakness in global mining markets continued to weigh on sales of engines to makers of earth-moving mining equipment, Cummins said sales of engines used to power construction equipment were strong during the quarter. The company also reported higher demand for on-highway truck components in North America, Europe and China.Looking forward, the company said it expects to post full- year 2014 revenues growth of between 4 percent and 8 percent and to report earnings before interest and tax in the range of 12.75 to 13.25 percent of sales. Ann Duignan, an analyst at JP Morgan, said the forecast implied 2014 EPS of about $8.50 - well below consensus estimates.Analysts, on average, expected Cummins to post a full-year 2014 profit of $9.23 a share, according to Thomson Reuters estimates.In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Cummins shares fell 1.8 percent at $124.38.(Reporting by James B.

4,"  Ford Motor Co debuted new versions of two medium-duty commercial trucks on Tuesday at a trade show in Indianapolis, vehicles that - for the first time in years - will be built without the help of Navistar International Corp, Cummins Inc or Allison Transmission Holdings Inc.The 2016 F-650 and F-750 trucks, which will go on sale in the spring of 2015, will be assembled at Ford's plant in Avon Lake, Ohio and feature chassis, engine and transmissions all built in-house.For years, the two vehicles were built on chassis made in Escobedo, Mexico under a joint venture with Navistar, using diesel engines supplied by Cummins and transmissions supplied by Allison.Ford executives say bringing the components back in-house will reduce costs and simplify service issues when they arise.The production shift to the United States is welcome news for most of the 1,600 UAW-represented production workers employed at the Ohio plant. They faced the specter of mass layoffs as Ford largely phased out the E-Series ""Econoline"" van currently made in their plant in favor of the new Transit line of vans, which will be built in Kansas City. By moving medium-duty truck production back to the United States, only a few hundred union members will lose their jobs.F-650 and F-750 buyers will have two engine choices with the new trucks, according to Ford: a new 6.7-liter V8 diesel, built at the company's plant in Chihuahua, Mexico, or a V-10 gasoline engine built at its plant in Windsor, Ontario, which can be factory-modified to run on compressed natural gas or liquid propane gas. Ford will no longer offer customers the option of having a 6.7-liter turbo diesel built by Cummins installed in the vehicles. That powerplant provided the muscle for all the diesel versions of the trucks in recent years but is being discontinued as Ford brings the truck's key content in-house.Both vehicles have also undergone major redesigns that have put key components under the cab instead of behind the cab or on the frame, a change Ford says will make it much easier for buyers to customize their trucks. That's important because the F-650 and F-750 are typically sold as cab-and-chassis-only skeletons and customized by purchasers to serve as everything from dump trucks to ambulances, furniture and beverage delivery vehicles to electric-utility and oil-field service trucks.Ford said it will announce pricing later this year.

12,"  (Repeats with no changes to text)By John KempLONDON Aug 19 Cheap natural gas is starting to revolutionise traffic on U.S. roads, cutting bills for some of the country's heaviest fuel users while reducing carbon emissions and other pollution.The revolution is still in its very early stages. Gas remains a niche vehicle fuel, with last year's nationwide consumption less than the amount of gasoline and diesel dispensed in the tiny state of Vermont.But gas consumption by motorists, taxis, refuse trucks, transit operators and logistics companies is growingly rapidly at a time when overall gasoline and diesel sales are flat.Like other bold gambles on new technology, there is no guarantee that this one will pay off. But the steady rise in natural gas sales suggests that gas-fuelled vehicles are making progress.Gas as a transport fuel is sometimes portrayed as a cottage industry, but the truth is rather different. Gas-fuelled vehicles have strong support from some of the biggest and most powerful names in truck manufacturing and petroleum.Royal Dutch Shell is constructing a network of natural gas fuelling stations at truck stops along the interstate highway system in association with TravelCenters of America, an existing truck refuelling operator.Love's Travel Stops, Blu LNG, Kwik Trip, Questar Fueling and TruStar Energy are also adding gas-refuelling systems at locations across the United States as well as parts of Canada.The concept has powerful strategic and financial backing from engine manufacturer Cummins, gas producer Chesapeake Energy and equipment maker and financing company General Electric.Leading truck manufacturers including Freightliner, International, Kenworth, Peterbilt, Mack and Volvo  all offer natural gas trucks using Cummins' ISX 12G engine, which one major fuel supplier hopes will be a ""game changer"" for the industry.TRADE-OFFS Gas-fuelled vehicles typically cost significantly more than conventional gasoline and diesel-powered equivalents, while fuelling stations dispensing compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the public remain rare.Set against these disadvantages, however, is the substantially lower price of natural gas. Between 2011 and 2013 compressed CNG and LNG delivered cost savings of more than $1 per gallon on an energy equivalent basis compared with gasoline and diesel to California customers.For individual vehicles and fleet operators that use a lot of fuel each year, the savings on fuel can more than offset the increased equipment costs and inconvenience arising from restricted refuelling infrastructure.Switching to gas makes most sense for high-mileage vehicles and those with very large engines, which explains why taxi fleets, transit operators, refuse collectors, airport shuttles and trucking companies have shown the most interest in gas-fuelled engines.SLOW START Gas conversion, however, has been plagued with the teething problems typical in any new technology and there is still competition between companies promoting either CNG or LNG as the best fuel.The transition has not been helped by early gas-fuelled engines not always being suitable for certain customer groups. Cummins, the leading engine manufacturer, supplied 8.9 lire and 15 litre engines suitable for LNG, but the former did not deliver enough horsepower and the latter was too large for efficient operation by most potential users.Gas-fuel vendors are pinning their hopes on a new generation of 12 litre Cummins engines, led by the ISX 12G, to speed the spread of gas-fuelled vehicles. Notwithstanding the problems, sales of gas as a road transport fuel are rising rapidly. Clean Energy Fuels, the leading provider of natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicles in the United States and Canada based on sales volumes and the number of refuelling stations, has reported rapid and sustained growth in the amount of CNG and LNG sold since 2009.Clean Energy Fuels sold almost 65 million gasoline gallons equivalent (GGE) of natural gas fuels in the second quarter of this year, up from 50 million in the same period of 2012 and 25 million in 2009.CNG accounts for two thirds of the company's sales, but deliveries of both CNG and LNG have been rising steadily over the past five years (link.reuters.com/sat62w).Roughly half of all natural gas sales for transport fuel are in California, according to the Energy Information Administration, and gas sales remain tiny compared with other fuels.U.S. drivers purchased 174 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel last year, according to the Federal Highway Administration. So if Clean Energy manages to sell 170 million gasoline equivalent gallons in 2014, it will still amount to less than 0.1 percent of all U.S. fuel sales.But Clean Energy has big ambitions and believes it is well positioned to capture expected future growth in demand for alternative-fuelled vehicles. CLEAN ENERGY The company owns, operates and supplies 516 refuelling stations dispensing CNG, LNG or biogas, up from 224 at the start of 2011.Some of these stations are open to the public, but the majority are private stations operated on behalf of transit and refuse companies or other fleet operators.In 2013 Clean Energy served 779 fleet customers operating approximately 35,000 natural gas vehicles and had fuelling stations in 39 states across the United States, plus the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia in Canada.In the first six months of this year the company added another 43 CNG fleet customers, accounting for an extra 9.8 million gallons of sales, and 11 new LNG customers, adding an extra 6.5 million gallons.Clean Energy has been building a network of refuelling stations along major transportation corridors, which it calls ""America's Natural Gas Highway"" (ANGH). The idea is to guarantee refuelling facilities for coast-to-coast trucking companies.More than 80 ANGH stations have been built, though only a minority are open to the public, with the company waiting for customer demand to increase.Building so much infrastructure has pushed Clean Energy deep into debt. The company posted a pre-tax loss of $60 million in the first half of this year, bringing total pre-tax losses since the start of 2011 to $271 million.""We have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in future,"" the company admits, adding in regulatory filings that it might never achieve or maintain profitability and that investment in the business ""involves a high degree of risk"".The company had consolidated debt of more than $600 million on June 30, according to its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Clean Energy is essentially a concept company dedicated to the idea that cheap gas could grab a significant share of North America's giant fuel market.The main risks are that the company will run out of cash before natural gas vehicles go mainstream or oil prices fall enough to spoil the economics of switching.But otherwise the concept is a good one. Gas is cheap and abundant in North America and the engine technology is mature.Gas will not be suitable for all motorists, but for a group of the heaviest users there is a compelling argument for making the switch.

14,"  (Corrects AUG 19 story to show engine maker Westport, not Cummins, paragraph 16)By John KempLONDON Aug 19 Cheap natural gas is starting to revolutionise traffic on U.S. roads, cutting bills for some of the country's heaviest fuel users while reducing carbon emissions and other pollution.The revolution is still in its very early stages. Gas remains a niche vehicle fuel, with last year's nationwide consumption less than the amount of gasoline and diesel dispensed in the tiny state of Vermont.But gas consumption by motorists, taxis, refuse trucks, transit operators and logistics companies is growingly rapidly at a time when overall gasoline and diesel sales are flat.Like other bold gambles on new technology, there is no guarantee that this one will pay off. But the steady rise in natural gas sales suggests that gas-fuelled vehicles are making progress.Gas as a transport fuel is sometimes portrayed as a cottage industry, but the truth is rather different. Gas-fuelled vehicles have strong support from some of the biggest and most powerful names in truck manufacturing and petroleum.Royal Dutch Shell is constructing a network of natural gas fuelling stations at truck stops along the interstate highway system in association with TravelCenters of America, an existing truck refuelling operator.Love's Travel Stops, Blu LNG, Kwik Trip, Questar Fueling and TruStar Energy are also adding gas-refuelling systems at locations across the United States as well as parts of Canada.The concept has powerful strategic and financial backing from engine manufacturer Cummins, gas producer Chesapeake Energy and equipment maker and financing company General Electric.Leading truck manufacturers including Freightliner, International, Kenworth, Peterbilt, Mack and Volvo  all offer natural gas trucks using Cummins' ISX 12G engine, which one major fuel supplier hopes will be a ""game changer"" for the industry.TRADE-OFFS Gas-fuelled vehicles typically cost significantly more than conventional gasoline and diesel-powered equivalents, while fuelling stations dispensing compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG) to the public remain rare.Set against these disadvantages, however, is the substantially lower price of natural gas. Between 2011 and 2013 compressed CNG and LNG delivered cost savings of more than $1 per gallon on an energy equivalent basis compared with gasoline and diesel to California customers.For individual vehicles and fleet operators that use a lot of fuel each year, the savings on fuel can more than offset the increased equipment costs and inconvenience arising from restricted refuelling infrastructure.Switching to gas makes most sense for high-mileage vehicles and those with very large engines, which explains why taxi fleets, transit operators, refuse collectors, airport shuttles and trucking companies have shown the most interest in gas-fuelled engines.SLOW START Gas conversion, however, has been plagued with the teething problems typical in any new technology and there is still competition between companies promoting either CNG or LNG as the best fuel.The transition has not been helped by early gas-fuelled engines not always being suitable for certain customer groups. Engine maker Westport supplied 8.9 litre and 15 litre engines suitable for LNG, but the former did not deliver enough horsepower and the latter was too large for efficient operation by most potential users.Gas-fuel vendors are pinning their hopes on a new generation of 12 litre Cummins engines, led by the ISX 12G, to speed the spread of gas-fuelled vehicles. Notwithstanding the problems, sales of gas as a road transport fuel are rising rapidly. Clean Energy Fuels, the leading provider of natural gas as an alternative fuel for vehicles in the United States and Canada based on sales volumes and the number of refuelling stations, has reported rapid and sustained growth in the amount of CNG and LNG sold since 2009.Clean Energy Fuels sold almost 65 million gasoline gallons equivalent (GGE) of natural gas fuels in the second quarter of this year, up from 50 million in the same period of 2012 and 25 million in 2009.CNG accounts for two thirds of the company's sales, but deliveries of both CNG and LNG have been rising steadily over the past five years (link.reuters.com/sat62w).Roughly half of all natural gas sales for transport fuel are in California, according to the Energy Information Administration, and gas sales remain tiny compared with other fuels.U.S. drivers purchased 174 billion gallons of gasoline and diesel last year, according to the Federal Highway Administration. So if Clean Energy manages to sell 170 million gasoline equivalent gallons in 2014, it will still amount to less than 0.1 percent of all U.S. fuel sales.But Clean Energy has big ambitions and believes it is well positioned to capture expected future growth in demand for alternative-fuelled vehicles. CLEAN ENERGY The company owns, operates and supplies 516 refuelling stations dispensing CNG, LNG or biogas, up from 224 at the start of 2011.Some of these stations are open to the public, but the majority are private stations operated on behalf of transit and refuse companies or other fleet operators.In 2013 Clean Energy served 779 fleet customers operating approximately 35,000 natural gas vehicles and had fuelling stations in 39 states across the United States, plus the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia in Canada.In the first six months of this year the company added another 43 CNG fleet customers, accounting for an extra 9.8 million gallons of sales, and 11 new LNG customers, adding an extra 6.5 million gallons.Clean Energy has been building a network of refuelling stations along major transportation corridors, which it calls ""America's Natural Gas Highway"" (ANGH).

15,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Cummins, Inc.'s (CMI)  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and long-term debt ratings at 'A'. The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings incorporate CMI's strong operating profile including competitive  positions in its engine and power generation markets, technological  capabilities, and global distribution network. The company's new product  development continues to be effective in meeting new requirements for fuel  efficiency, emissions standards, and systems integration. In addition, CMI's  financial flexibility and low leverage mitigate concerns about the company's  exposure to cyclical heavy- and medium-duty truck, off-road equipment, and power  generation markets.  CMI's debt totaled nearly $1.7 billion at June 29, 2014, and debt/EBITDA  remained low at 0.74x. CMI's leverage would be lower when considering the impact  of earnings from manufacturing and distributor joint ventures which are excluded  from Fitch's calculation of EBITDA.  Joint venture income from unconsolidated ventures, primarily related to the  engine and distribution segments, is an important source of earnings for CMI and  generates approximately 17% of segment profit. In late 2013, CMI initiated a  plan to acquire most of its partly-owned distributors in the U.S. and Canada to  be largely completed by the end of 2016. It estimates the acquisitions will  total approximately $600 million, of which roughly half had been completed by  mid-2014. The majority of the transactions are occurring at predetermined prices  as distribution agreements expire.  CMI expects that full ownership of the distributors will enable it to streamline  operations and improve customer support. Slightly more than half of distribution  revenue is generated from parts, filtration and service which tend to be more  stable than CMI's original equipment business. Acquiring CMI's North American  distributors involves less risk than acquiring unrelated third-party businesses  and provides an opportunity to capture future aftermarket revenue associated  with original equipment sales.  Rating concerns include normal cyclicality in CMI's end markets and the risk of  vertical integration by CMI's truck engine customers. CMI has a substantial  market share of engine sales in the North America heavy duty and medium duty  markets, but its customers also produce their own engines which could  potentially displace CMI engines. This concern is mitigated by CMI's effective  product development which supports demand by end-users for its engines. Also,  any loss of market share could be partly offset by expansion in emerging regions  which offer long-term growth prospects and by diversification across CMI's other  engine, components and distribution businesses.  Other rating concerns include spending for share repurchases and acquisitions  which are up materially. The company intends to return 50% of operating cash  flow to shareholders, but this level should still allow it to maintain low  leverage and solid liquidity. Fitch expects CMI would adjust discretionary  spending if necessary to maintain strong credit metrics.  Revenue has been up modestly year-to-date and could increase by at least high  single digits for the full year. The positive sales trend reflects CMI's  distributor acquisitions, improving demand in the North America heavy- and  medium-duty truck market, and higher volume in the Components segment related to  new emissions standards in Europe and China. Demand in the North America truck  market may begin to moderate by 2015 but should remain positive due to growing  freight volumes and sustainable industry production levels for heavy duty  trucks.  Strength in the truck market is partly offset by continued weakness in the Power  Generation segment due to low demand in international markets and by a decline  in CMI's military revenue in North America. The Power Generation business is not  expected to improve in the near term, but CMI has introduced new products in the  smaller end of the generator market and taken steps to reduce costs. Growth in  emerging markets is mixed and will depend partly on enforcement of emissions  standards that support sales of Cummins' emissions equipment. China and Europe  are improving but the truck market in Brazil has experienced a significant  decline due to a weak economy.  Margins, excluding equity income from joint ventures, could increase for all of  2014 due to higher volumes in the Engine and Components segments. The impact of  higher volumes is partly offset by warranty costs which, although still at low  levels, are temporarily being negatively affected by engine complexity  associated with emissions technology and on-board diagnostics. Lower margins in  the Power Generation business could stabilize or recover as CMI adjusts its cost  structure in line with revenue.  Fitch estimates free cash flow (FCF) after dividends in 2014 could decline to  around $600 million compared to FCF of $929 million in 2013. The estimated  decline reflects the absence of positive tax items that occurred in 2013 and the  negative impact of higher capital expenditures and dividends in 2014. Fitch  expects FCF could remain lower in 2015 depending on working capital requirements  and capital expenditures needed to support sales growth and new product  development. However, Fitch estimates CMI will generate solid FCF over the long  term, including FCF/Total Adjusted Debt of 15%-20% or higher. The company has a  history of generating positive FCF even during weak parts of the economic cycle.  CMI expects to contribute $205 million to pension plans in 2014, including $94  million of required contributions, compared to $169 million in 2013. CMI  contributed $156 million in the first half of 2014. In 2013, the U.S. plan  reached an overfunded position as a result of asset returns and contributions.  At the end of 2013, U.S. plans were overfunded by $184 million and U.K. plans  were overfunded by $87 million.  Liquidity at June 29, 2014 included cash and equivalents of approximately $2.2  billion, not including $158 million of marketable securities. Slightly more than  half of CMI's cash was held outside the U.S. Liquidity also included  availability under a $1.75 billion five-year revolver which matures in 2017,  most of which was available. Liquidity was offset by $33 million of current  maturities of long term debt and $30 million of loans payable. Debt maturities  are spread out, with no significant maturities scheduled before 2023. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --Consistently higher margins through business cycles, including EBITDA margins  near 15% or higher, compared to 12.4% in 2013 and roughly 12%-14% since 2010;  --FCF/Total Adjusted Debt consistently above 20%; --A reduction in the risk of potential outsourcing of engines at large truck  customers, relative to total sales and earnings derived from truck customers; --Continued low leverage, defined as debt/EBITDA near 0.5x or lower and FFO  adjusted leverage consistently near 1.0x-1.5x. Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --Cash deployment for share repurchases or other discretionary spending  contributes to consistently higher leverage defined as debt/EBITDA above 1.25x; --Market share deteriorates as a result of customer in-sourcing or competitive  pressure; --Weak FCF, including FCF/Total Adjusted Debt consistently in the mid-teens or  below; --Unexpected challenges related to CMI's technological capabilities and new  product development lead to lower profitability and FCF.  Fitch has affirmed CMI's ratings as follows: --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured credit facility at 'A';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

16,"  Oct 28 Cummins Inc posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, lifted by strong sales of its vehicle components in North America, Europe and China.But the company, which also makes natural gas engines used to generate electricity, said global demand for that equipment ""remains weak"" and was considering a restructuring that could cuts costs in the long term but may reduce earnings by as much as $40 million. The Columbus, Indiana-based maker of diesel engines and fuel and emission controls reported third-quarter net profit of $423 million, or $2.32 a share, up from $355 million, or $1.90 a share, during the comparable quarter last year. Analysts, on average, expected Cummins to post a profit of $2.28 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 15 percent to $4.9 billion. Revenue growth was especially strong in North America, where trucking companies, encouraged by the economic rebound, falling fuel prices and rising freight volumes, are updating their fleets and buying more trucks from key Cummins' customers, including Paccar Inc  and Navistar International Corp.

24,"  Shares of Cummins Inc (CMI.N) rose almost 4 percent after the diesel engine maker reported a rise in quarterly revenue, boosted by distributor acquisitions in North America and stronger demand in truck and bus markets.Total revenue increased to $5.02 billion in the second quarter from $4.84 billion in the same period last year.Cummins' revenue from North America jumped 12 percent in the quarter, while international sales fell by 6 percent, dragged lower by a weak economy in Brazil. Net income attributable to Cummins rose to $471 million, or $2.62 per share, from $446 million, or $2.43 per share, a year earlier.Cummins expects full-year 2015 revenues to grow between 2 percent and 4 percent. On a conference call following the earnings release, Cummins executives said the company hoped to get market share in China to 17 percent by 2018, with a ""stretch goal"" of 25 percent.  Second-quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, increased 6 percent year-over-year to $960 million, the company said. ""The growth was driven primarily by stronger sales of new engines and components in our highway markets, which more than offset very weak market conditions,"" Chief Executive Tom Linebarger said.Cummins has had a presence in China for over 30 years, with several products featuring on and off-highway vehicles and strong relationships with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Cummins' executives said they recognized that the Chinese economy had slowed, but still see sales in China growing to $3.5 billion this year, up from $3.3 billion in 2014. Second-quarter sales rose in all four of Cummins' major segments. In engines, strong demand for on-highway, or trucks and buses, drove sales growth, which was offset by weaker demand in global industrial markets and lower truck demand in Brazil. Growth in the distribution segment included a $14 million gain from North American acquisitions, while a stronger dollar hurt the segment's sales by 6 percent. Higher sales in components and power generation were driven by demand in international markets. Cummins shares rose $4.72, or 3.8 percent, to $128.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

On a conference call following the earnings release, Cummins executives said the company hoped to get market share in China to 17 percent by 2018, with a ""stretch goal"" of 25 percent.Second-quarter revenues in China, including joint ventures, increased 6 percent year-over-year to $960 million, the company said. ""The growth was driven primarily by stronger sales of new engines and components in our highway markets, which more than offset very weak market conditions,"" Chief Executive Tom Linebarger said.Cummins has had a presence in China for over 30 years, with several products featuring on and off-highway vehicles and strong relationships with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).Cummins' executives said they recognized that the Chinese economy had slowed, but still see sales in China growing to $3.5 billion this year, up from $3.3 billion in 2014. Second-quarter sales rose in all four of Cummins' major segments. In engines, strong demand for on-highway, or trucks and buses, drove sales growth, which was offset by weaker demand in global industrial markets and lower truck demand in Brazil.Growth in the distribution segment included a $14 million gain from North American acquisitions, while a stronger dollar hurt the segment's sales by 6 percent.Higher sales in components and power generation were driven by demand in international markets.Cummins shares rose $4.72, or 3.8 percent, to $128.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

28,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Cummins, Inc.'s (CMI)  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and long-term debt ratings at 'A'. The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings incorporate CMI's strong operating profile including competitive  positions in its engine and power generation markets, strong technological  capabilities, and global distribution network. CMI's low leverage and  consistently positive free cash flow (FCF) through downturns mitigate risks  related to the company's exposure to cyclical heavy- and medium-duty truck,  off-road equipment, and power generation markets. At June 28, 2015 debt/EBITDA  was 0.6x and FCF/total adjusted debt was 22%. CMI's leverage would be lower when  considering the impact of earnings from manufacturing and distributor joint  ventures which are excluded from Fitch's calculation of EBITDA.  Rating concerns include possible changes to CMI's financial policies, which  typically have been targeted toward a strong balance sheet and a high level of  financial flexibility consistent with the company's 'A' ratings. The company  stated during its second quarter earnings call that, while its financial  policies have not changed, it is focused on generating higher growth and returns  to shareholders and could be comfortable with leverage that is higher than the  company's previously low levels. In Fitch's view, there is room at CMI's current  ratings for a modest increase in leverage, including an increase in debt/EBITDA  to slightly above 1x, but Fitch could consider a negative rating action if  credit metrics appear likely to weaken significantly. Fitch estimates CMI's results in 2015 will improve slightly, including revenue  growth in the low single digits as the addition of recently acquired  distributors and strong demand for heavy and medium duty trucks in North America  offsets the negative impact of currency and weaker demand in international  markets. Margins could increase for all of 2015 due to the consolidation of  higher-margin distribution revenue and lower cost of materials. Low margins in  the Power Generation business are recovering as it completes restructuring  actions. Fitch estimates free cash flow (FCF) after dividends for all of 2015 will be at  least $600-$700 million compared to $873 million in 2014. The decline reflects  higher dividend payments and a slight increase in working capital assumed by  Fitch. Dividends have increased materially in the past two to three years as  part of CMI's plan to return 50% of operating cash flow to shareholders.  CMI's cash deployment includes returning 50% of operating cash flow to  shareholders. The company repurchased $514 million of shares during the first  half of 2015; more than $500 million of capacity remains under the existing  repurchase program. CMI also expects to spend $150 million - $190 million in the  third quarter of 2015 for distributor acquisitions.  Other rating concerns include CMI's exposure to the cyclical heavy duty truck  market in North America and the risk of vertical integration by CMI's truck  engine customers, many of whom manufacture engines as well as trucks. CMI's  share of engine sales in the North America heavy duty market has declined to a  range near 35% compared to the high-30% range previously as certain customers  supply a larger proportion of their own engines and as vertically integrated  Europe-based truck makers increase their presence in the U.S. CMI's share of the  medium duty truck market in North America is materially higher than heavy duty  engines but is subject to similar concerns. The impact from the loss of market share is partly offset by CMI's expansion in  emerging regions, particularly through joint ventures and new product  introductions in China that have benefited from trends toward stricter emissions  standards, demand for better fuel efficiency and more technology content. New  product introductions by CMI's joint ventures and components business in China  are boosting revenue despite slowing economic growth in the region and lower  industry demand. Slower growth in emerging markets, including Brazil, is a  continuing concern.  Production of heavy duty trucks in North America may be near a cyclical peak  which could limit CMI's revenue growth when industry demand tapers off. However,  the pace of a downturn in industry truck production, when it occurs, could be  relatively moderate, reflecting the measured pace of increases in production  compared to previous cycles. Also, freight volumes remain solid and replacement  demand is supported by the age of the industry fleet which remains elevated. The majority of CMI's recent acquisition spending has been used to purchase the  remaining equity in most of its U.S. and Canadian distributors. These  acquisitions are expected to be largely completed by the end of 2015. Full  ownership of the distributors should enable CMI to streamline operations and  improve customer support. It also provides an opportunity to capture  distribution aftermarket revenue from parts, filtration and service which tend  to be more stable than CMI's original equipment business.  Joint venture income from unconsolidated ventures, primarily related to the  engine and distribution segments, generates approximately 13% of segment profit.  The proportion of CMI's earnings from joint ventures has declined slightly due  to the company's acquisitions of its partly-owned distributors in the U.S. and  Canada since 2013, partly offset by an increase in income from the Beijing Foton  engine joint venture. China should be a source of long-term demand, but there  are concerns about government constraints on participation by foreign companies  and the near-term impact of recent large declines in industry truck production. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: --North America truck production reaches a cyclical peak in 2015 and begins to  decline in 2016; --CMI's engine market share in North America declines gradually due to vertical  integration by heavy duty truck OEMs;  --CMI gains additional market share in China, including consolidated and joint  venture revenue; --CMI pays approximately 50% of operating cash flow as dividends and share  repurchases; --FCF of $600-$700 million in 2015; --Segment EBIT margins increase by approximately 50-100 bps in 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --Market share in the North America heavy duty Class 8 truck market deteriorates  as a result of customer in-sourcing or competitive pressure, without offsetting  gains in other markets; --CMI loses competitiveness as a result of ineffective new product development; --Cash deployment for share repurchases or other discretionary spending  contributes to consistently higher leverage, including debt/EBITDA consistently  above 1.25x; --Weak FCF resulting in FCF/Total Adjusted Debt declining to the mid-teens  compared to levels above 20% historically. Fitch believes a positive rating action is unlikely given cyclicality in CMI's  end markets and the possibility of a change in the company's financial policies.  However, future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  positive rating action include: --Consistently higher margins through business cycles, including EBITDA margins  near 15% or higher compared to a range of 12%-14% since 2010;  --FCF/Total Adjusted Debt consistently above 25%; --Vertical integration by heavy duty truck manufacturers is limited, allowing  CMI to maintain or increase market share; --Debt/EBITDA is reduced consistently below 0.5x and FFO adjusted leverage  declines below 1.0x.  LIQUIDITY Liquidity at June 28, 2015 included cash and marketable securities of  approximately $1.8 billion. Approximately $1 billion of CMI's cash was held  outside the U.S., much of which would incur taxes if repatriated. Liquidity also  included availability under a $1.75 billion five-year revolver which matures in  2018, most of which was available. Liquidity was offset by $31 million of  current maturities of long-term debt and $70 million of loans payable. Debt  maturities are spread out, with no significant maturities scheduled before 2023.  CMI's debt totaled nearly $1.7 billion at June 28, 2015. CMI expects to contribute $175 million to pension plans in 2015, including $93  million of required contributions, compared to $205 million of total  contributions in 2014. The plans in both the U.S. and U.K. are overfunded which  minimizes the likelihood of large future contributions and supports FCF.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed CMI's ratings as follows: --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured credit facility at 'A';  --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

32,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings believes Cummins Inc.'s (CMI)  financial flexibility mitigates concerns about possible debt funded  acquisitions, although there is an increased risk that such transactions could  occur. CMI stated during a meeting with investors yesterday that it could allow  leverage to increase in the event of material acquisitions, including an  increase in debt/EBITDA to a range of 1.5x-2.0x, or possibly higher in certain  instances. This is above the 1.25x level that Fitch previously indicated could  trigger a negative rating action, and well above the company's historical  leverage, including debt/EBITDA of 0.6x and FFO adjusted leverage of 1.2x as of  Sept. 27, 2015. The Issuer Default Rating of 'A' assigned by Fitch incorporates  flexibility for a modest increase in leverage, including debt/EBITDA slightly  above 1x and FCF/total adjusted debt near 20% compared to levels above 20%  historically. Fitch could take a negative rating action if credit metrics are weak for a  sustained period of 1-2 years without clear plans by CMI to return them to  stronger levels. This could occur if mid-cycle debt/EBITDA is above 1.25x or  FCF/Total Adjusted Debt declines to the mid-teens.  Fitch interprets CMI's willingness to consider debt-funded acquisitions and  higher leverage as providing flexibility to make acquisitions, and that the  company intends to maintain strong credit metrics over the long term at levels  consistent with an 'A' rating. Fitch believes CMI would use future free cash  flow to reduce debt or could adjust its cash deployment to free up funds,  including, if necessary, a temporary reduction to its long term plan to return  50% of operating cash flow to shareholders.  Rating concerns include weak business cycles in several of CMI's markets  including power generation and off-road equipment and key regions such as China  and Brazil. As a result, there is a risk that a large debt-funded acquisition  during a cyclical downturn could make it difficult for CMI to rebuild credit  metrics at a pace that would support its current ratings. In addition, a large  acquisition would involve integration risk.  These concerns are mitigated by CMI's competitive positions in its engine and  power generation markets, technological capabilities, global distribution  network, and strong operating cash flow.

33,"  (Adds detail on announcement, expected demand, background on rivals)By Joseph WhiteDETROIT - Nov 20 The head of Daimler AG's  commercial truck operation told Reuters Friday the company will invest $375 million at a complex near Detroit to build diesel engines for medium duty trucks, expanding a strategy of building and selling trucks, engines, transmissions and axles as a package.Daimler had previously expanded its Detroit operations to produce heavy-duty automatic transmissions, which have been ""a runaway success,"" Wolfgang Bernhard, head of Daimler's global commercial truck operations, said ahead of an appearance in Detroit Friday.Bernhard said he expects demand for medium and heavy trucks will be ""slightly softer"" in North America next year, but should still be above relatively strong 2014 levels. European demand will be flat and Brazil will ""continue to be very difficult,"" he said. Earlier this week, rival truck maker AB Volvo said it planned to idle its North American factories for a total of 2.5 weeks in December and January to reduce swelling inventories.Bernhard said Daimler, which controls about 40 percent of the U.S. heavy truck market, is not cutting back. Production at its Detroit engine and transmission factories is still running around the clock, seven days a week, he said. Daimler's latest investment in Detroit builds on a strategy Bernhard has pursued to bring engineering and manufacturing of the company's commercial trucks under one roof.Traditionally, especially in North America, heavy truck makers such as Paccar Inc or Navistar International Corp have purchased engines, transmissions, axles and other major components from suppliers such as Cummins Inc , Eaton Corp PLC, Caterpillar Inc or Dana Holding Corp. Government demands to cut carbon dioxide emissions are putting more pressure on commercial vehicle makers. Bernhard said Daimler's response will be to design and engineer itself more of the technology in its vehicles.""We can perfectly optimize those components to each other to get the best fuel economy and reliability,"" he said.Bernhard said Daimler is also using its own technology to develop autonomous driving systems for future commercial vehicles. He said trucks that could drive themselves on open freeways could be available by 2020. Daimler is testing autonomous driving technology on heavy trucks in Germany and the United States.(Reporting By Joe White; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2015-11-20,CMI,"Fri Nov 20, 2015 | 10:11am EST",UPDATE 1-Daimler to invest $375 mln to build diesel engines,http://www.reuters.com//article/daimler-trucks-idUSL1N13F0W620151120?type=companyNews

38,"  WASHINGTON Contracts to buy previously owned U.S. homes surged far more than expected in April to the highest level in more than a decade, another sign the economy has gained steam during the second quarter.The National Association of Realtors said on Thursday its pending home sales index, based on contracts signed last month, increased 5.1 percent to 116.3, a level not seen since February 2006.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales rising 0.6 percent last month. Contracts usually become sales after a month or two.The increase in pending home sales for March also was revised marginally upward. Overall pending home sales last month were up 4.6 percent from a year ago.  The housing sector has steadily strengthened on the back of an economy near full employment and historically low mortgage rates.

39,"   By David Shepardson  Volkswagen AG's (VOWG_p.DE) $15.3 billion settlement of allegations that it cheated on diesel engine pollution tests promises a substantial boost for federal and state efforts to expand electric vehicle sales, and could also help producers of commercial trucks and buses and other heavy equipment.At the center of the Volkswagen agreement are ""cash for clunkers"" programs aimed at taking older, sooty vehicles off the road - and not just Volkswagen models the government alleges were deliberately designed to cheat emissions tests.Manufacturers of commercial trucks, school buses and machinery used to move goods at seaports or tow airplanes also stand to benefit from provisions of the settlement, according to state and federal officials. Volkswagen has agreed to put $2.7 billion over three years into a trust fund created to cut diesel pollution. States can use the money to replace and scrap or retrofit older vehicles with new models equipped with better exhaust cleaning technology.For example, school systems driving buses 10 years old or older could get Volkswagen money to buy new models. Other eligible vehicles include tugboats, ferries, freight switchers, transit buses, medium and heavy duty trucks, airport ground support vehicles and ocean going vessels, according to settlement documents.Older diesel engines emit air pollutants linked to a range of serious health problems including asthma, lung and heart disease, other respiratory ailments, and premature death, the Environmental Protection Agency said.John Stark, editor in chief, Stark’s News Service, said the program may boost medium duty truck sales and diesel engine manufacturers such as Cummins Inc (CMI.N).VW's 650 U.S. dealers may get a boost from owners selling back their vehicles - and some may even be interested in buying a new vehicle from VW. Buybacks will start as early as October. VW will pay up to $10.033 billion to buyback as many as 475,000 2.0 liter diesel vehicles - and give most owners at least $5,100 to $10,000 in additional compensation. Other potential beneficiaries of Volkswagen's agreement include marketers of electric vehicle or fuel cell charging systems. VW agreed to spend $2 billion on electric vehicle infrastructure and other projects over 10 years - including $800 million in California. The California Air Resources Board said the VW funds would almost quadruple the money available for electric vehicle infrastructure in the state. ""All charging infrastructure in EVs floats the rest of the market. Since there is not enough existing charging infrastructure any capital that comes into the market benefits all EV suppliers and charging suppliers,” said Mike Calise, chief executive of Car Charging Group, a charging services company. California, joined by nine other states, has mandated that zero emission vehicles account for 15 percent of sales by 2025 - a figure automakers have said is unrealistic. The plan for spending the initial $500 million is due in 2017, court documents show. VW will also agree to fund a ""Green City"" initiative in California to include features like electric vehicle car sharing services, zero emission transit applications, and zeroemission freight transport projects.

52,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Cummins Inc (CMI.N), a U.S. manufacturer of engines for large trucks, is preparing to explore the sale of a business that makes filters and coolants, potentially valuing it at more than $1.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.The move comes as weak heavy-duty truck production in North America and poor global demand for power generation equipment have hit the company's profits. However, filtration businesses are still seen as financially resilient.Earlier on Thursday, Parker-Hannifin Corp (PH.N), which makes motion and control systems for the industrial and aerospace markets, said it would buy air filtration system maker Clarcor Inc (CLC.N) for about $4.3 billion, including debt.Cummins is working with an investment bank to prepare to run an auction for its filtration business in the next two months, the sources said this week, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential. A Cummins spokeswoman declined to comment.Cummins' filtration business offers more than 8,300 products, including air, fuel, lube and hydraulic filters, as well as fuel water separators, coolants and fuel additives. The potential sale also comes after German industrial filter maker Mann + Hummel completed its acquisition of U.S. peer Affinia last May to boost its annual sales by $1 billion, or more than a third, and gain access to the U.S. market for heavy-duty and hydraulic filters.Truck makers have experienced a drop in sales this year as lackluster economic growth and high retail inventories have discouraged many trucking companies from putting in orders for new vehicles.  Based in Columbus, Indiana, Cummins makes diesel and natural gas engines and engine-related component products for the truck and industrial markets. It earned $1.4 billion last year on sales of $19.1 billion.Last month, Cummins reiterated its downbeat full-year revenue forecast and said quarterly sales in its engine unit were down 12 percent from a year earlier.
