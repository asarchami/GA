14,"  U.S. auto parts retailer Advance Auto Parts Inc (AAP.N) reported a 4.8 percent fall in quarterly revenue as it grapples with ""service shortfalls"" and the unavailability of parts, sending the company's shares down more than 6 percent premarket.The company said comparable store sales fell 4.1 percent in the second quarter, compared with a 1 percent rise a year earlier, due to store closures last year and as it works to consolidate its Carquest stores.""Our second quarter results were not acceptable,"" Chief Executive Tom Greco said. "" ... We are taking decisive actions to deliver near-term improvement.""The company, which sells products such as batteries, air fresheners and engine parts, makes more money from service stations than from sales directly to consumers at its more than 5,000 stores.Advance Auto Parts got the Carquest chain of stores when it bought General Parts International Inc in 2014.

Net income dropped to $124.6 million, or $1.68 per share, from about $150 million, or $2.03 per share.The Roanoke, Virginia-based company earned $1.90 per share on an adjusted basis. Analysts on an average had expected the company to earn $2.12 per share on revenue of $2.24 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Up to Monday's close, shares had risen 11.5 percent this year.
