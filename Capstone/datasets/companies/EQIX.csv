That agreement would involve Interxion shareholders receiving 2.3386 new Telecity shares for each Interxion share, valuing the offer at $2.2 billion when it was announced.Telecity said on Thursday the Interxion deal prohibited either company from soliciting or discussing alternative proposals except in limited circumstances, and it believed the Equinix approach was one such situation. Interxion reacted to the development by reiterating its commitment to the ""strategically compelling"" deal.In a separate statement, Equinix, which has a stock market value of almost $15 billion, said the Telecity deal would add capacity to several of its locations in Europe such as London and extend its footprint into new locations such as Dublin, Milan and Warsaw.Equinix must decide whether to make an offer by June 4.

6,"   By Liana B. Baker  U.S. data center company Equinix Inc is nearing a deal to acquire British peer Telecity Group Plc, according to people familiar with the matter, in a tie-up that would create the largest data center player in Europe. A deal could be announced as early as Friday, one of the people said. The negotiations are in the final stages but could still fall apart, the people added.The deal price could not be learned. Equinix had previously offered 2.3 billion pounds ($3.5 billion) to convince Telecity to enter into negotiations. Telecity shares ended trading in London at 1,090 pence on Thursday, giving it a market capitalization of $2.2 billion pounds. The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Equinix declined to comment, while Telecity did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Founded in 1998, Equinix operates more than 100 data centers in 33 markets in five continents. It previously said that buying Telecity would give it more locations in Britain, including central London. It would also expand its footprint in cities such as Dublin, Milan, Istanbul, Stockholm, Helsinki and Warsaw.  Telecity in February said it would buy Dutch rival Interxion Holding NV in a $2.2 billion all-stock deal. Equinix said earlier this month that acquiring Telecity would create a more compelling combination than the proposed merger with Interxion and would deliver greater value for Telecity shareholders.Based in Redwood City, California, Equinix spent $482 million on buying IXEurope, a European colocation company, in 2007.  Equinix received a nod from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service on May 20 that it could convert into a real estate investment trust.  (Reporting by Liana B.

Underpinning deal activity in the sector is the industry's  plans to tap growing demand across new geographies for ""cloud"" technology, whereby the data and processing for devices such as  smartphones use millions of remote servers.The acquisition of Telecity by Equinix, a deal that Reuters on Thursday reported was near fruition, would create the largest data center company in Europe. Equinix Chief Executive Steve Smith said he had looked closely at Interxion and Telecity as targets but ultimately chose Telecity because its assets and brand were a better fit. ""Their customer base and footprint are more complementary to where we needed to go next,"" Smith said in an interview.While the purchase of Telecity would be the largest transaction in Equinix's history, Smith said, Equinix has a strong balance sheet and is open to further deals. ""This deal doesn't preclude us from taking action if there were other opportunities,"" he added.

29,"  Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, is selling 29 data centers in the United States and Latin America to Equinix Inc (EQIX.O) for $3.6 billion, as the telecom giant focuses on its core business.The data centers being sold are located in 15 metro areas, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Bogota and Sao Paulo.The sale represents Verizon's efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers.The enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data.Verizon, which bought data center company Terremark Worldwide for $1.4 billion in 2011, has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N and Sprint Corp (S.N), which offer deep discounts on cellphone and data plans.Verizon has pivoted to mobile video and advertising by making high-profile acquisitions - it is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion, and had picked up AOL for $4.4 billion last year. Reuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets.The company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees.For Equinix, the world's biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas. ""We've been looking at these assets for a long time ...(they) check a number of strategic boxes for us,"" Equinix Americas President Karl Strohmeyer said in a call with analysts.The acquired portfolio includes about 900 customers, bringing Equinix's total number of data centers to 175 in 43 markets. Equinix was advised by Evercore, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP.Citi and Guggenheim Partners were financial advisers to Verizon, while Jones Day provided legal counsel to Verizon.Shares of Equinix were up 1.8 percent at $337.98, while Verizon was little changed in early trading.
