0,"  After rallying from its largest deficit of the season to remain unbeaten, No. 5 Wichita State has to be feeling invincible heading into Tuesday's Missouri Valley Conference game against visiting Bradley. Described by coach Gregg Marshall as the first close game his team has had, the Shockers dug out of a 19-point hole to beat Missouri State 72-69 in overtime Saturday. ""We've had some games where we made some plays down the stretch to win by five or whatever, but as far as a game really being in doubt, this is by far the toughest game we've had,"" Marshall told reporters.Bradley also gave Missouri State a good battle recently before losing by three points, which could suggest these teams are not as far apart as their records. The Braves snapped a seven-game losing streak with a victory over Drake, but have since lost to Missouri State and Indiana State, also by three points. ""I was proud of our kids, we really battled and I'm happy we did some good things,"" coach Geno Ford told the Peoria Journal Star after the game against Indiana State, which like Wichita State is 4-0 in conference. ""At the same time, the result isn't what you're looking for, so you can't get too excited. But we are a lot better now than we were in December.""TV: 8 p.m. ET, ESPN3 ABOUT BRADLEY (6-11, 1-3 MVC): The Braves struggle in a lot of ways, in particular shooting and turnovers, where they rank in the bottom half of Division I with 13.3 per game. The shooting problems were there against Indiana State as the Braves made 34.9 percent of their field goals while holding the Sycamores to less than 40 percent. ""When you go on the road and play a team this good, you don't have to be perfect,"" Ford told the Journal Star. ""But you can't afford missed layups and missed free throws. When we needed to be up 10 to 12 in the first half because they weren't sharp early, we didn't take advantage of it.""ABOUT WICHITA STATE (17-0, 4-0 MVC): The Shockers moved up to fifth in the Top 25, the highest they have been since ending last season as the fourth-ranked team. Cleanthony Early had 22 points and 15 rebounds against Missouri State and continues to lead the team in scoring (16.6) and rebounds (6.9) per game, while being complemented by the trio of Ron Baker (13.1 points), Fred VanVleet (12.2) and Tekele Cotton (9.9). ""That's a hell of a team. They were ready for us,"" VanVleet told the Sporting News of Missouri State. ""We gave them way too many open shots in the first half. That'll get you in an 18-point hole really quick. It took everything we had to sneak out of here with a win."" TIP-INS 1. The Shockers have won the last five meetings by an average of 24.8 points, but trail in the series 71-58. 2. The Braves last win at Koch Arena was in 2008.3. Early, Baker and VanVleet have combined to shoot 83.6 percent from the foul line.PREDICTION: Wichita State 77, Bradley 55",2014-01-14,HAS,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 6:02am EST",Preview: Bradley at Wichita State,http://www.reuters.com//article/bkc-bradley-wichitast-preview-idUSMTZEA1EE43HRM20140114?type=companyNews

If it changes the pace of tapering - and uncertainty in emerging markets and the weak January payrolls have raised the odds of that to some - it may raise concerns that the economy is still not strong enough to strengthen on its own.

Baker and Ramkumar Iyer  Hasbro Inc (HAS.O) is in early talks to buy Hollywood studio DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc DWA.O, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.DreamWorks' shares closed up 14 percent at $25.52 on Thursday.Hasbro's stock closed down 4.3 percent as investors worried over the impact of a deal on the company's partnership with Disney.DreamWorks Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg is seeking more than $30 per share, according to the New York Times, which first reported the talks.The offer values DreamWorks at $2.56 billion, according to calculations by Reuters. The company's stock closed at $22.37 on Wednesday.

32,"  MEXICO CITY The world's No. 2 toymaker, Hasbro Inc, has paid $65 million to Mexican tax authorities in a settlement, a spokeswoman for the company said on Wednesday, following a probe into the company for possible for tax avoidance. The deal resolves outstanding tax assessments for all open years from 2000 to 2013, spokeswoman Julie Duffy said in an email. Last year, Mexico said it had launched a probe of 270 companies for allegedly exploiting loopholes that have led to the loss of potential tax revenue for years.Reuters reported in September that Hasbro, along with household product maker Procter & Gamble Co, were at the heart of the probe.In December, Mexico's tax collection agency SAT said it had reached a deal with a multinational company but did not reveal its name. SAT was not immediately available for comment. In its third quarter earnings report released in November, Hasbro said it was ""vigorously defending"" itself against Mexican tax assessments of about $296 million over how it accounts for cross-border transactions, known as transfer pricing issues.  The company, known for its My Little Pony toys and Transformers action figures, said it was in discussions with tax authorities to reach a settlement.    Mexico's actions reflect frustration among some large developing countries, including China and India, with legal loopholes in international tax rules that companies can exploit to shift profits to tax havens. Mexico, home to global automakers and light assembly plants for sectors like pharmaceuticals and aeronautics, has among the lowest tax takes in the OECD, crimping its ability to spend on programs vital to boosting economic growth and living standards.Hasbro's shares closed up 0.78 percent on Wednesday at $56.58.

""Exclusive of currency, Hasbro should be able to show an increase in 2015 (sales), and that's not obvious for Mattel at all,"" Needham & Co analyst Sean McGowan said.Hasbro and Mattel have said a strong dollar would remain a headwind in 2015.

The company also has a deal with Discovery Communications Inc for shows based on its brands such as My Little Pony.It could take until 2016 or even 2017 for Mattel to start showing sales growth, Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink said.The sequels of ""Jurassic Park"" and ""The Avengers"" are expected in the first half of this year, while the new ""Star Wars"" movie is expected in December.

Hasbro jumped 5.3 percent after the toymaker  reported a surprise increase in revenue. Royal Caribbean  fell 7.6 percent after it reported a 3.7 percent fall in revenue, saying a strong dollar hurt onboard spending by customers from outside the United States.The market is responding to earnings that are good but not good enough to push stocks to new records. Concerns remain about currency effects, Greece and China, said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.""These have kept the market very range bound and we just keep climbing, falling, and starting to climb back up again."" Nearly 75 percent of the S&P 500 components that have reported earnings have beat analyst expectations, so far topping the 70 percent average in the last four quarters. However, just 45.8 percent have beat on revenue, compared to the 58 percent average top line beat over the last year.""What's helped the market today is the story about more stimulus in China,"" said Meckler.The downside, he said, is that the stimulus responds to a stubborn lack of growth. Despite lackluster U.S. economic data, a world grappling with slow growth and concern that Greece and Ukraine could default on their debt, the U.S. stock market has been more than resilient.

DreamWorks spokesman Dan Berger declined to comment, while Comcast was not immediately available for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.An acquisition of DreamWorks by Comcast will bring a breath of fresh air for the company that has held several unsuccessful buyout talks in the past.In September 2014, DreamWorks was reported to be in talks about a possible sale to cash-rich Japanese communications and media company Softbank Corp.

Dreamworks Animation was spun off from DreamWorks Studios in 2004 as a separate listed company.The earlier DreamWorks Studios was founded in 1994 by Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who moved with the spin-off and remains chief executive of the animation company. DreamWorks, which is in the middle of a turnaround, has been reducing its dependence on the volatile feature films business to concentrate on increasing revenue from licensing its original content to media houses and video-streaming companies such as Netflix Inc and Verizon Communications Inc's Go90.Shares of DreamWorks, which has a market cap of $2.35 billion, closed at $27.12, on Tuesday, while Comcast ended at $61.05.

Chief Executive Brian Goldner said the category was hit due to a massive drop in sales of toys based on ""Jurassic Park"" and ""Jurassic World"" films and Hasbro would no longer make ""Jurassic Park"" toys from the end of 2017. Revenue from toys targeted at girls jumped 35 percent as Hasbro benefited from demand for dolls based on Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) princesses such as Cinderella and Snow White. Hasbro acquired the rights to make these dolls in 2014 and started selling them this year.GREAT EXPECTATIONS  Hasbro's quarterly sales beat analysts' expectations by a margin of 2.3 percent, compared with 3-8 percent in five of the prior six quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data.Investors were getting accustomed to a big beat and this ""straight down the middle fairway"" quarter feels like a disappointment, Piper Jaffray & Co analyst Stephanie Wissink said. ""If I was a long-term investor in this story, what happened today would not shake my confidence."" Goldner said on a conference call that Hasbro would start shipping toys based on ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" in the current quarter. Dolls based on DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc's DWA.O movie ""Trolls"" will hit the stores in August. Goldner also said Britain's vote to exit the European Union had created some near-term uncertainty, but Hasbro was yet to see any negative impact. The net income attributable to Hasbro jumped 24.6 percent to $52.1 million, or 41 cents per share, in the quarter ended June 26, while revenue rose 10 percent to $878.9 million.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 39 cents per share and revenue of $859 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
