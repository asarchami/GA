2,"   By Caroline Humer  Aetna Inc (AET.N), the third-largest U.S. health insurer, said on Thursday it expects to lose money on the Obamacare exchanges even as demand for these insurance plans has picked up over the past few weeks.President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, often called Obamacare, created online insurance exchanges where individuals can buy health coverage with income-based government subsidies. The exchanges opened on October 1 to sell plans for coverage effective January 1, but technology issues delayed enrollment for the first few months.Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said the demographics of the new members were ""a little skewed"" toward an older, higher-cost population. He said the financial risks of the business were manageable but that Aetna's 2014 profit outlook was based on losses from the new plans.""We expect the business to lose money in the first year,"" Bertolini told investors during a conference call. He said Aetna had signed up 135,000 paid members through the end of January.The company also reported higher fourth-quarter earnings and revenue.Aetna, which is operating on the exchanges in 17 states, is considering where it will offer Obamacare plans in 2015, and at what price, as it gathers information on the health of the new members.The company has been looking at these members' pharmacy records as well as the health records of previous Aetna customers to understand what its costs from Obamacare will be.The website problems and the extension of some old health plans into 2014 have shrunk the pool of applicants for the exchange plans and diverted younger and healthier people.HealthCare.gov, which sells insurance in 36 states, began working better in December, and about 3 million people had signed up through that site and in the 14 states running their own websites as of late January, the government has said.About 6 million people are expected to sign up for 2014 on the exchanges, the Congressional Budget Office said earlier this week, cutting its outlook by about 1 million. Another factor in 2015 pricing is the size of the network of doctors and hospitals. These networks have come under scrutiny as individuals have begun to realize their new plans may exclude their desired hospital or doctor.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversee the exchanges, this week outlined new expectations for 2015 network disclosures and standards that may be tougher for insurers to meet.Aetna Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin said in an interview that he did not believe the administration was asking for larger networks in 2015 than the insurers use in 2014.""I don't think we can conclude that yet from this letter,"" Guertin said. ""This is not a new issue ... It's a longstanding issue of balancing access with affordability.""White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Thursday that the Affordable Care Act includes measures to make sure consumers have a choice in providers, but added that Health and Human Services (HHS) was working on additional measures.""For 2015, HHS plans to have even more aggressive efforts in place to ensure that consumers have good networks of doctors, community providers and specialists,"" Carney said. Smaller networks are less expensive for insurers because they are able to keep tighter control on costs.For 2014 coverage, Aetna said it had received about 200,000 enrollment applications in all, but only about 70 percent have paid. Competitor Humana Inc (HUM.N) reported a similar enrollment number on Wednesday, WellPoint Inc WLP.N said last month that it had received 400,000 enrollment applications.UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N), the largest U.S. insurer, is only selling on a few exchanges and has not reported enrollment.Cigna Corp (CI.N) reports its quarterly earnings on Friday.MEDICARE GROWTH  The individual business represents about 3 percent of Aetna's total medical membership, which reached 22.2 million at the end of 2013.About 18 million of the customers are in Aetna's corporate health plan business, and the company has a growing private Medicare business. About 150 million people in the United States have employer-based healthcare.Aetna said it expected to add 110,000 new private Medicare customers in the first quarter. Government-paid healthcare programs, like Medicare for older people, are growing fast as baby boomers age into the program.Both earnings and revenue were helped by the more than $5 billion acquisition of Coventry Healthcare in 2013.Aetna reported net income of $369 million, or $1 per share, up from $190 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding acquisition-related costs, a charge for increasing liability for life insurance claims, and other items, earnings were $1.34 per share, compared with analysts' expectations of $1.36, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of Aetna were down 0.3 percent at $67.96 in afternoon trading.Revenue rose 33 percent to $13.18 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $13.14 billion.In Aetna's largest commercial business, which includes corporate as well as individual plans, the ratio of healthcare spending to premium revenue fell from a year earlier, to 81.7 percent from 83.4 percent.(Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton; editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Bernadette Baum and David Gregorio)",2014-02-06,AET,"Thu Feb 6, 2014 | 3:41pm EST","Aetna to lose money on Obamacare exchanges, CEO says",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-aetna-results-idUSBREA151QJ20140206?type=companyNews

10,"   By Julie Steenhuysen | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Increased attention given to patients in primary care practices organized into so-called medical homes may not improve quality of care or reduce health costs as reformers of the U.S. healthcare system had hoped, researchers said on Tuesday.Thousands of primary care doctors in the United States are revamping their practices based on this new medical home model.Under this scheme, doctors and other providers receive bonuses from insurance companies for spending extra time with patients by extending office hours and providing follow-up care in hopes of keeping them healthier and out of the hospital.In medical home practices, primary care doctors adopt a team-based care approach using patient registries, electronic health records and other tools to help identify high-risk patients and deliver more personalized care.The thinking is that this extra attention will result in improved quality and reduced spending.But new evidence from a large, three-year pilot study among 32 physician practices in Pennsylvania found modest improvements in quality of care and no reductions in hospitalizations, emergency department visits or total costs of care.""The medical home has gained popularity as a new model of primary care, with the expectation that the approach will produce better and lower-cost health care,"" said Dr Mark Friedberg, the study's lead author and a scientist at RAND, a nonprofit research organization. ""Our findings suggest that achieving all of these goals is a challenge.""The findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on Tuesday. This adds to evidence from a study of five Rhode Island physician practices published in September in JAMA Internal Medicine that found no statistically significant improvements in quality or emergency department visits, although there were signs that ER use was declining.Dr Thomas Schwenk of the University of Nevada School of Medicine in Reno said the findings from the Pennsylvania trial suggest that the medical home movement may not work for every patient in every practice.""It's gotten to be almost a fad in which it is applied indiscriminately,"" said Schwenk, who wrote an editorial accompanying the study in JAMA. Schwenk calls the medical home model a ""powerful technology"" for treating expensive, high-risk patients, but when it has been applied in broad practice settings, it ""by and large has been shown not to be that effective.""Friedberg said the findings suggest it may be a little harder to achieve the goals of the medical home model than previously thought. ""I would not say our findings say the medical home model is doomed."" But, he added, ""It's not a sure thing.""Friedberg's team evaluated practices taking part in the Southeastern Pennsylvania Chronic Care Initiative, one of the first medical home pilots in the state. In this region, 32 primary care practices and six health plans took part in the pilot between 2008 and 2011.Practices in the pilot program were required to transform their practices into medical homes and become accredited by the National Committee for Quality Assurance or NCQA. Such practices enlist the help of everyone from nurses to front desk staff to help avoid costly and preventable complications by focusing on preventing and managing chronic disease.To motivate doctors in the Pennsylvania study, each practice was eligible to receive a $20,000 bonus support payment in the first year and annual bonus payments, which ranged from $28,000 to $95,000, depending on the size and structure of the practice. Using data on approximately 120,000 patients, researchers compared quality, use of medical services and costs of care between the pilot practices and 29 other practices.But over the three-year period, researchers found rates of quality significantly improved on only one out of 11 quality measures that included asthma care, cancer screening and overall diabetes control.They also did not find any reductions in the number of hospital visits, emergency department use or ambulatory care services, or in the total costs of medical care.The study did not examine why the pilot failed to make a major impact. Yet, the authors said the fact that many of the practices volunteered for the study suggest they may have already been more quality-conscious than other practices even before the pilot began.A POPULAR HYPOTHESIS  The findings contradict the hypothesis that better preventive and primary care will help patients avoid more costly medical problems down the line.Insurance companies pay a premium to primary care practices that organize themselves into a team of professionals, including nurse practitioners and 0physician assistants.More than 10 percent of U.S. primary care practices or about 7,000 practices, are recognized as patient-centered medical homes by the NCQA, the nation's largest group that certifies such practices.The movement got its start with an American Academy of Family Physicians report called the 2004 Future of Family Medicine. It has since been championed in President Barack Obama's healthcare law through provisions that allow states to boost reimbursements to primary care practices designated as medical homes for Medicaid patients.Health insurer Aetna Inc helped pay for the Pennsylvania study along with the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund. The company said it was still convinced of the value of the medical home model, noting it has come a long way since the start of the pilot.Elizabeth Curran, Aetna's head of National Network Strategy and Program Development, said Aetna has nearly 1 million commercial members being treated in patient centered medical homes under an estimated 5,000 primary care physicians.She said Aetna patients treated in a medical home have a range of 3 to 13 percent fewer visits to the emergency department per 1,000 patients than patients treated in typical practices. Medical costs per patient are from $2 to $24 cheaper per month in medical homes versus typical practices.Dr Elbert Huang, a health care policy expert at the University of Chicago Medicine who was not involved in the study, said three years may not be enough to show a significant impact in improving chronic diseases such as diabetes or asthma.""The practices clearly changed the way they do business,"" he said.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Diane Craft)",2014-02-25,AET,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 6:45pm EST","Popular U.S. health reform plan may not cut costs, boost quality: study",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-healthcare-medicalhomes-idUSBREA1O21G20140225?type=companyNews

12,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an expected rating of 'A-'  to Aetna Inc.'s (AET) proposed issuance of $750 million of senior unsecured  notes. AET's Long-term Issuer Default Rating is unaffected by this rating  action. Fitch affirmed the ratings of AET and its insurance operating subsidiaries with  a Negative Outlook on Nov. 27, 2013. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch expects proceeds from the issuance to be used to fund the recently  announced redemption of AET's $750 million of 6.00% senior notes due June 2016. Aetna's financial leverage has risen significantly over the past year as a  result of its acquisition of Coventry Health Care, Inc. (CVH) in May 2013. At  Dec. 31, 2013, the company's financial leverage was approximately 38%, and  debt-to-EBITDA was 2.1x for the 12 months ended Dec. 31, 2013. This is up from  33% and 1.3x, respectively, at June 30, 2012. The company's elevated financial  leverage and execution risk related to the CVH transaction are the primary  drivers of the Negative Outlook on Aetna's ratings. Fitch expects financial  leverage and run-rate debt-to-EBITDA to move below 35% and 1.8x, respectively,  by the end of the second quarter of 2015. Aetna's ratings reflect the organization's major market position and significant  size and scale, strong profitability and interest coverage, and generally solid  balance sheet characteristics. The company's ratings also reflect the risks  derived from government involvement in health insurance and managed care  companies' ongoing business activities. Fitch's long-held concern is that  government efforts to advance public policy goals could adversely affect health  insurance and managed care companies' ability to manage their business and  hinder their ability to generate cash flow supporting debt obligations. RATING SENSITIVITIES The key rating triggers that could result in a revision of the Outlook to Stable  include substantial progress toward a return of financial leverage metrics to  levels within guidelines for the company's ratings, specifically a  debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.8x or below and financial leverage ratio of 35% or  lower. The key rating triggers that could lead Fitch to downgrade the ratings include  run-rate: --Debt-to-EBITDA ratios that exceed 1.8x; --Debt-to-capital ratios that exceed 35%;  --EBITDA-to-revenue margins less than 7%; --EBITDA-based interest coverage ratios less than 10x or maximum allowable  dividend interest expense coverage below 5x; --Organization-wide run-rate Fitch-adjusted NAIC risk-based capital (RBC) ratios  below 275%.

16,"  (New throughout, updates share price)By Caroline HumerApril 24 Aetna Inc said on Thursday its first few months under Obamacare turned out better than some investors had feared as it added new members not only on the exchanges but in its traditional large corporate business.Aetna's shares surged nearly 6 percent as the company allayed Wall Street concerns that health costs were higher than what it and competitors had planned for. It also said it beat first-quarter profit expectations as bad weather helped keep down doctor visits and medical costs.This year, Aetna introduced health plans in 17 of the new insurance exchanges created by President Barack Obama's healthcare law nationwide, making it the largest player by number of states, ahead of even WellPoint Inc.A rocky start to the exchanges, with technical failures and an advertising counteroffensive by Republican opponents of the Affordable Care Act, had raised fears of weak enrollment skewed toward older and sicker consumers.Aetna, which had warned it could lose money on the insurance exchanges, said enrollment exceeded expectations at about 230,000 sign-ups. It also said the health of its new members so far appeared to match how it priced those plans. It is considering remaining in 17 markets for 2015.The No. 3 U.S. health insurer also said membership in its corporate-sponsored plans surged by more than 400,000 people, helping quarterly profit beat Wall Street expectations and countering concerns that employers would be quick to send workers to the Obamacare exchanges.""With one quarter down, it appears that our pricing for this year on all of our commercial business was appropriate and it appears adequate enough for us to recover the new taxes and fees that are going to be imposed on us,"" Aetna Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin said during an interview. Aetna said the total number of Obamacare enrollees for 2014 could even swell to 450,000 as more last-minute sign-ups are processed, and as some people qualify for coverage due to changes in status. The Obama administration has reported 8 million new sign-ups in the program nationwide so far.Aetna shares rose 5.9 percent to $72.96 and WellPoint Inc., which reports next week, gained nearly 2 percent to $96.54. Larger rival UnitedHealth Group rose 1.7 percent.""Part of the reason (Aetna) stock is reacting so well is their comments on pricing,"" explained Sarah James, an analyst for Wedbush Securities.Last week, UnitedHealth said more healthy consumers and small businesses renewed their policies rather than buying Obamacare plans, making the latter less profitable. Aetna said the renewals had occurred as expected and that its pricing was on target. Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said Aetna expects to submit proposed premium rates ranging from the low single-digit to double-digit percentages or more in its Obamacare markets for 2015. Those price increases are expected to play into the political fight over Obamacare as Republican lawmakers play up its faults ahead of congressional elections in November.HEPATITIS C DRUG CONCERNS Aetna raised its forecast for 2014 profit, saying it expected to end the year with an additional 800,000 to 1 million customers, with a total of more than 23 million people and $56 billion to $57 billion in operating revenues. It expects earnings of $6.35 to $6.55 per share, up from a previous forecast of at least $6.25 per share.Aetna said that another area of cost concern, an $84,000 new hepatitis C drug by Gilead Sciences Inc, had not materialized in its first quarter but would still be tracked closely this year.UnitedHealth said last week that spending on the new treatment, which has spurred a global outcry over the rising cost of novel drugs, had exceeded its expectations several times over. Aetna said it spent $30 million paying for the Sovaldi drug from Gilead in the first quarter, matching its expectations.In all, the health insurer's quarterly operating profit grew to $1.98 per share as severe winter weather slowed medical services use, which kept claims and costs down. A moderate flu season also helped, it said.Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.55 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That figure excludes items such as acquisition costs for the purchase of Coventry last year, whose inclusion also helped profit.Revenue rose to $14 billion from $9.54 billion in the year earlier quarter. Aetna said it had raised health plan premiums to offset new taxes and fees set by Obama's Affordable Care Act. They include a fee used to help fund the exchanges, which began providing coverage on Jan. 1.Aetna said it had 22.72 million medical customers at the end of March, up from 22.19 million at the end of December and 18.3 million at the end of March 2013.

17,"  April 24 Aetna Inc. spent about $30 million during the first quarter on Sovaldi, the pricey new hepatitis C treatment from Gilead Sciences Inc., Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin said on Thursday during a conference call with investors.Guertin said the costs were in line with the company's expectations. Most of it was in its commercial business and in Medicare Part D, the government program in which private insurers manage drug benefits.  Medicaid-related Sovaldi costs accounted for the smallest portion of that $30 million, he said, as some states continue to develop policies on the drug and because some states where it operates do not use private insurance to pay for any pharmaceutical benefits.

18,"   By Caroline Humer  Aetna Inc (AET.N) on Thursday reported a better-than-expected first quarter, helped by a surge in profits from its commercial business and by adding new customers.New customers were sourced partly from employers and partly from insurance exchanges created under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.It raised its forecast for 2014 profit, saying it expected to end the year with an additional 800,000 to 1 million customers, with a total of more than 23 million people and $56 billion to $57 billion in operating revenues.""Improvements appear to span the entire company, with limited health reform impact,"" Stifel analyst Thomas Carroll said in a research note.The third largest U.S. health insurer's quarterly operating profit grew to $1.98 per share as the percentage it spent on claims declined in its commercial business. Severe winter weather slowed medical services use, which kept claims and costs down, and a moderate flu season helped, it said. Aetna also said it had raised health plan premiums as it sought to recover Affordable Care Act-related taxes and fees in its revenues. Those taxes include an overall insurance fee that is used to help fund the exchanges, which began providing coverage on January 1.Revenue rose to $14 billion from $9.54 billion in the year earlier quarter.Aetna has one of the largest total memberships on these exchanges, behind WellPoint Inc. WLP.N, and offers plans in 17 states. Its better-than-expected quarter and raised outlook for 2014 growth comes one week after UnitedHealth Inc , which has only a small role on the exchanges, issued a conservative view for the year that brought sector shares down. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.55 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. That figure excludes items such as acquisition costs for the purchase of Coventry last year, which also helped profit.The company reported net income of $665.5 million, or $1.82 per share, up from $490.1 million, or $1.48 per share, a year earlier. Aetna said it had 22.72 million medical customers at the end of March, up from 22.19 million at the end of December and 18.3 million at the end of March 2013.The company's commercial business grew by 405,000 during the first quarter, which includes new customers on the exchanges and also from its employer-based business.For 2014, it expects earnings of $6.35 to $6.55 per share, up from a previous forecast of at least $6.25 per share.The company cautioned it had signed up more new exchange members than expected and was not certain of their medical costs. Previously the company has said it expects to lose money on this new business as some of the previously uninsured may bear higher health costs.(Reporting by Caroline Humer; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Sofina Mirza-Reid)",2014-04-24,AET,"Thu Apr 24, 2014 | 9:04am EDT",Aetna quarterly profit beats forecasts as new members surge,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-aetna-results-idUSBREA3N0Q320140424?type=companyNews

21,"  (Refocuses on exchanges)By Caroline HumerApril 30 WellPoint Inc on Wednesday said that its Obamacare exchange business was sustainable so far, echoing comments from another major insurer last week that these new customers have cost as much as expected, not more.The report lifted shares in WellPoint, the second-largest U.S. health insurer, by about 5 percent and gave its next largest competitor Aetna Inc a 1.5 percent increase as it eased some investor concerns about the profitability of this business.""They are saying that there were no issues in the exchange experience so far. They are growing gang busters if you will. Even if there were any issues that manifested themselves going forward, they have very strong reserves and good overall results,"" Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said.The exchanges, created under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law, have sold new health plans to more than 8 million people. Insurers, and critics, have worried about the health of these new customers and whether the business will be a drain on insurers and U.S. taxpayers.WellPoint is selling individual policies on the new exchanges in the 14 states where it operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans. It has the most total customers on the exchanges, about 150,000 more than Aetna, which is in 17 states.WellPoint said it added 400,000 new customers during the quarter and expects a total of 600,000 this year after it accounts for all enrollees, including those who signed up after a Feb. 15 cut-off for March 1 coverage. The business is ""in the green"", with profit margins of 3 to 5 percent, its top finance executive said.The age and general characteristics of the customers as well as the type of insurance coverage they have purchased were in line with the premium prices it set, WellPoint said, similar to the experience Aetna Inc described last week.WellPoint Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt cautioned he wants to see the remaining enrollments in the second quarter before declaring a win.""I want to make sure that converts before we officially say that we've got it all right, but it's very encouraging right now,"" DeVeydt said. The results underscored the company's improved outlook for 2014, which it raised by about 20 cents per share to at least $8.40 per share, excluding items.WellPoint's comments were more positive than Aetna's, which said that pricing had been in line with customer demographics but that ultimately it continued to see the business as a ""headwind"" for 2014 results.Like Aetna, WellPoint also said it is keeping an eye on the costs of the pricey new hepatitis C treatments, which cost $50 million in the first quarter alone. It has built in $100 million in additional hepatitis C drug costs for 2014, the company said.Gilead Sciences' new treatment Sovaldi broke sales launch records during the first quarter with its $84,000 price tag. An estimated 3.2 million Americans have this virus that can cause liver wasting disease and for the first time, this drug promises many of them a cure. NET PROFIT FALLS Net profit fell during the quarter, largely because of investment spending related to healthcare reform and higher administrative costs of adding new commercial customers.WellPoint, which runs Anthem and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, reported net income of $701 million, or $2.40 per share, down from $885 million, or $2.89 per share, a year earlier.Excluding net gains on investments, WellPoint's profit was $2.30 per share. Analysts on average had expected $2.12, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company said it had spent less on medical claims than expected, partly due to bad weather. Taxes were also lower than expected, while overall costs remained constrained.The company added 1.2 million members in its commercial business, which includes large national employers, local employers and the individual markets.

22,"   By Ben Hirschler | LONDON  LONDON As Pfizer's (PFE.N) pursuit of AstraZeneca (AZN.L) provokes uproar, another big U.S. healthcare group is taking a much quieter path into the heart of UK bioscience from an inconspicuous office off London's Oxford Street.Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.N) life science ""innovation centre"", which opened a year ago, represents a different approach to drug development based on building networks and scouting for small deals, rather than mega-merger consolidation.Its team of two dozen scientists-cum-dealmakers, operating in the shadow of the Debenhams department store, struck 16 agreements last year for promising new treatments from universities and biotech companies in Britain and across Europe.Rival drugmakers are also putting an increased emphasis on doing external deals for early-stage science, but J&J has gone further than most in decentralizing the decision-making process. It has set up similar talent-spotting innovation offices in Shanghai, Boston and Menlo Park, California, in the past 12 months.""Other companies have two or three scouts in certain countries, but they need to call head office to get a decision, which means going to one committee and then another,"" said Patrick Verheyen, who heads up J&J's innovation operation in London.His team, by contrast, have autonomy to strike deals and see projects right through until the ""proof of concept"" stage of clinical testing.For many in the pharmaceutical industry, this outward-looking approach represents the future, because tapping into external science is vital if large corporations are to keep up with fast-moving developments in basic science and biotechnology. And that leaves some analysts wondering whether Pfizer's $106 billion attempt to buy AstraZeneca - a move rejected by the British firm - is actually focused on better drug discovery or really all about tax and cost savings, as many critics charge.""Pharma companies need to spend fewer biodollars internally and externalize more, yet Pfizer seem to be arguing they can succeed by pooling more intellectual capital in-house,"" said Navid Malik, head of life sciences research at Cenkos Securities.ONE PLUS ONE EQUALS LESS THAN TWO AstraZeneca, for its part, says the notion that smashing together two Big Pharma research departments leads to improved productivity has been debunked by past large-scale mergers in the sector. ""When you bring two huge organizations together, our industry tells us that it is hugely disruptive in terms of site closures, role closures,"" Mene Pangalos, the British group's head of early drug development, told a parliamentary panel on Wednesday. ""Overall, one plus one doesn't equal two - one plus one equals one point something.""Still, the situation is not black and white.Pfizer itself also does early-stage research deals - it struck a tie-up with UK universities in rare diseases just last week - and J&J has not shied away from some big acquisitions, with its medical devices unit buying Swiss-based Synthes for $20 billion in 2012. But J&J's business development work in pharmaceuticals is primarily focused these days on acquiring individual experimental medicines, whether at an early or late stage of testing. As a result, about half of J&J's drug pipeline now comes from outside the company, against an industry average of around a third.Interestingly, AstraZeneca also has a large proportion of experimental drugs that were invented externally, following a deal-making splurge by the company in the past few years, which was designed to plug a gap left by patent expiries and a run of in-house pipeline failures.With his small team in London - plus satellite partnering offices in Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester and Cardiff - Verheyen knows his operation is just one cog in the larger J&J research and development machine, which has interests spanning drugs, medical devices and consumer health products.But after years working on mergers and acquisitions within the U.S. group's pharmaceuticals division, he sees a clear rebalancing of the R&D model across J&J and the wider industry.""There is a shift to external research, absolutely. Most of the innovation is happening outside the walls of our organization,"" he said.""We as taxpayers fund a lot of academic research, so if we can help to make something from that academic research and help bring products closer to market then that is good for everybody.""(Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Will Waterman)",2014-05-14,AET,"Wed May 14, 2014 | 7:42am EDT",J&J taps British science quietly where Pfizer storms in,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-jj-idUSBREA4D09T20140514?type=companyNews

As a result, about half of J&J's drug pipeline now comes from outside the company, against an industry average of around a third.Interestingly, AstraZeneca also has a large proportion of experimental drugs that were invented externally, following a deal-making splurge by the company in the past few years, which was designed to plug a gap left by patent expiries and a run of in-house pipeline failures.With his small team in London - plus satellite partnering offices in Cambridge, Oxford, Manchester and Cardiff - Verheyen knows his operation is just one cog in the larger J&J research and development machine, which has interests spanning drugs, medical devices and consumer health products.But after years working on mergers and acquisitions within the U.S. group's pharmaceuticals division, he sees a clear rebalancing of the R&D model across J&J and the wider industry.""There is a shift to external research, absolutely. Most of the innovation is happening outside the walls of our organisation,"" he said.""We as taxpayers fund a lot of academic research, so if we can help to make something from that academic research and help bring products closer to market then that is good for everybody.""

26,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. economy likely contracted at a much sharper pace in the first quarter than previously estimated with data on Wednesday showing weaker healthcare spending. The Commerce Department's quarterly services survey, or QSS, showed healthcare outlays were not as strong as the government had assumed when it published its second gross domestic product estimate for the first quarter last month.The government reported that the economy contracted at a 1.0 percent annual rate in the January-March period. But with healthcare spending data now in hand, economists say growth probably declined at a rate of at least 1.7 percent. A widening of the nation's trade deficit in March had already led economists to anticipate a downward revision to GDP when the government publishes its third estimate later this month. Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania said the latest numbers on services spending ""made the first quarter look even worse.""""Healthcare spending did not add nearly as much to growth as we initially thought in the first quarter,"" he said. It is not unusual for the government to make big revisions to GDP numbers as it does not have complete data when it makes its first and second estimates, and the QSS has led to big revisions at times over the last several years.Even if the economy turns out to have been much weaker than previously thought, there is little cause for concern as many of the factors that held it down in the first quarter were temporary and data ranging from employment to factory and services sector activity indicate it has since rebounded.The government previously estimated that healthcare spending contributed one percentage point to growth, but economists said the QSS suggested healthcare spending added only about 0.7 percentage point. Since the fourth quarter, demand for healthcare services has helped to push up consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Part of the rise in spending reflects the implementation of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York, said there was some uncertainty about how the government would incorporate the QSS data into its healthcare consumption estimate in the GDP data. ""But it looks like there could be a significant downward revision to healthcare consumption, which would make the healthcare data more in line with most of the other components of GDP which looked weak in the first quarter,"" said Silver. Should first-quarter GDP be revised sharply lower, economists could trim their growth estimates for 2014, which had been dubbed as a break-out year.""Because we had such a horrible start to the year, you're going to see GDP estimates for all of 2014 ratcheted down a little bit,"" said Sweet.

27,"  (Adds context on exchanges)June 11 Health insurer Aetna Inc is submitting premium rates to regulators for Obamacare insurance plans for 2015 that generally increase less than 20 percent from 2014, its Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said on Wednesday.Bertolini's comments, made during a Goldman Sachs healthcare conference outside Los Angeles, come as insurers prepare next year's health plans for the insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.About 8 million people have signed up for these plans, which are provided by commercial subscribers and come with income-based government subsidies. While Aetna and other insurers say they have lost money providing these plans this year, insurers are expanding into new markets for 2015 to capture a growing customer base.Bertolini said about half the rate of increases the insurer has submitted for 2015 were due to changes in Obamacare. Over the past year, President Barack Obama's administration has made such changes to the law as allowing some plans that had been due to phase out this year to remain in place. That has changed some of the assumptions that determine premium rates.Bertolini had predicted rate increases along these lines in April when he announced the company's first quarter earnings report. In addition, the company expects about 450,000 exchange customers at year end, in line with his previous outlook, Bertolini said during the presentation to investors.Aetna is one of the largest players on the exchanges, along with WellPoint Inc.Bertolini said the 2014 outlook takes into account that Aetna customers were disenrolling from exchange plans on a regular basis. While he didn't know why they were leaving, he suspected it was due to out-of-pocket costs before members reach their deductibles.

32,"   By Andrew  M. Seaman | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Young adults were more likely to report better physical and mental health after the U.S. passed sweeping changes to its healthcare system in 2010, according to a new study.Young people also spent less money after they were allowed to be covered under their parents’ health insurance plans until they turned 26 years old under the Affordable Care Act - better known as Obamacare, the researchers report.“I think our study suggests it improved health and reduced exposure to healthcare costs,” Dr. Kao-Ping Chua said. “I think the larger question of cost versus benefit requires further study, but there do appear to have been significant benefits.”Chua is the study’s lead author and a pediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital.He and his colleague Dr. Benjamin Sommers write in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association, that the effect expanding insurance access to young Americans had on healthcare spending, use and overall health was unknown. “The reality is that when policies come out it takes about one to two years for national surveys to collect data on the post policy years,” Chua said. “So right now is when data from 2011 and 2012 are coming out.”They analyzed data collected between 2002 and 2011 in annual surveys conducted by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and compared results for 26,453 people between the ages of 19 and 25 years old to those for 34,052 people between the ages of 26 and 34.Before the healthcare law was implemented, about 63 percent of the younger group and about 73 percent of the older group were covered by health insurance. Insurance coverage increased to about 69 percent after the law’s implementation in the younger group, but didn’t change significantly for the older group. About 27 percent of the younger group reported excellent physical health before the policy change and that increased to about 31 percent after the law’s implementation. There was also an increase in the percentage reporting excellent mental health.For the older age group, however, the percentage reporting excellent physical or mental health dropped slightly between the two time periods.The researchers also found that yearly out-of-pocket healthcare costs declined by about 18 percent for the younger group compared to the older group. “I think our study suggests there was an improvement in self-reported physical and mental health as well as a decrease in out-of-pocket medical expenditures,” Chua said.He added that they did not see an increase in how much healthcare people were using from before the policy was implemented, but more time may be needed to see a trend like that.“Utilization may not have picked up in year one of the provision but as people get used to the idea of having insurance they may start using it more,” he said.Also, because they only had data on a brief amount of time after the policy was implemented, Chua said additional research will be needed to confirm these findings.“I think that will be an active area in future research,” he said.",2014-06-17,AET,"Tue Jun 17, 2014 | 4:28pm EDT",U.S. healthcare law tied to benefits for young adults,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-obamacare-young-adults-idUSKBN0ES2QM20140617?type=companyNews
33,"   By Olivia Oran and Mike Stone | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. drugmaker AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) has recently approached London-listed Shire PLC (SHP.L) about a potential takeover, according to people familiar with the matter, marking the latest attempt by U.S. healthcare companies looking to acquire overseas rivals partly to lower their tax rates. AbbVie, which makes rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira, has a market capitalization of around $86 billion, while Shire has a market capitalization of roughly $38 billion.The companies have held talks in recent weeks following AbbVie's takeover approach, but there is no guarantee the discussions will lead to a transaction, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Both parties have exchanged letters about a potential deal, the people said. It is also possible that other suitors will emerge for Shire, the people added.AbbVie said it does not comment on speculation and Shire could not be immediately reached for comment. Founded in 1986 in Britain, Shire conducts most of its business in the United States and has been domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes since 2008. With its tax base in Ireland, where effective corporate tax rates are among the lowest in the world, Shire, with a mid-sized market value, has been seen as a prime takeover target for U.S. drugmakers. Shire is weighing AbbVie's approach against the merits of remaining independent, as its chief executive Fleming Ornskov has only completed his first year on the job and has an alternative strategy of growing through acquisitions, one of the people said.Shire specializes in medicines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which account for around 40 percent of its sales. The firm also sells pricey drugs to treat rare genetic disorders and is building up a portfolio of treatments in ophthalmology and other specialty disease areas.AbbVie, based in North Chicago, Illinois, was founded last year as a spin-off from Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N). The company has been criticized for its overreliance on its top drug, Humira, which comprised over half of its revenue in the most recent quarter.  To lessen its reliance on Humira, the company is attempting to develop treatments for hepatitis C, cancer and other diseases.Shire had also been approached by Allergan Inc (AGN.N) in the months before the Botox maker itself became a takeover target for Valeant, Reuters previously reported.That approach did not lead to serious discussions between the two parties and there are currently no talks with Allergan, Reuters reported earlier this week.  U.S. pharmaceutical companies are in a race to keep up with rivals and are looking at lowering their tax rates in order to do so, in what is called as an inversion. Recent inversion deals have included medical device company Medtronic Inc's (MDT.N) $42.9 billion deal for Covidien this week, as well as Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) abortive $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca PLC (AZN.L).Some U.S. lawmakers are concerned that the deals erode government revenue by giving corporations another tax-avoiding loophole. Two bills in the U.S. Congress and a White House proposal would make inversions harder to do, but neither has gained much traction.

35,"   By Kate Holton and Chris Vellacott | LONDON  LONDON British drugmaker Shire (SHP.L) has rejected a 27 billion-pound  ($46 billion) takeover offer from AbbVie (ABBV.N), the latest attempt by a U.S. healthcare firm to tap into lower tax rates abroad via an acquisition.Shire, which has no single controlling shareholder, has been seen as a prime takeover target for U.S. drugmakers due to its attractive rare diseases business and its Irish tax base. Saying its annual product sales are set to more than double by 2020 to $10 billion, Shire rejected the 46.26 pounds per share offer as failing to reflect its true value, despite the offer being at a 30 percent premium to its share price over the last month.But analysts and one large shareholder said the firm may struggle to resist a bid of over 50 pounds per share.""You can easily see other people coming for Shire now because it’s in a good space,"" one of Shire's 40 biggest shareholders told Reuters.""Their pipeline is fantastic, it’s growing at 20 percent so for them (Abbvie) to offer 46 quid for that sort of growth profile we think is not enough. If they came back with 50-plus people would find it difficult (to say no) and that would be very sad.""Founded in 1986 in Britain, Shire conducts most of its business in the United States and has been domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes since 2008. AbbVie's takeover offer proposed creating a new U.S.-listed holding company with a tax domicile in Britain, where the government has also introduced tax breaks designed to encourage research and development. The approach marks the latest in a long line of mergers proposed by U.S. firms seeking to lower their tax rates, and comes less than a month after the collapse of Pfizer's (PFE.N) $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca (AZN.L) which was also motivated in part by tax considerations.    Ireland's corporation tax rate currently sits at 12.5 percent, one of the lowest in the world, while Britain has been cutting its rate from 28 percent in 2010 to 21 percent this year and 20 percent from 2015, well below the U.S. headline rate of 35 percent plus local taxes.Tax advisers say the British system also enables international companies to lower their tax rates in other ways.  Shire said the offer from AbbVie not only undervalued the company's prospects but ""the board also had concerns regarding the execution risks associated with the proposed (tax) inversion structure, as AbbVie would redomicile in the UK for tax purposes."" HIGHER PRICE NEEDED AbbVie was first to release a statement confirming that its offer had been rejected, after Reuters revealed the talks late on Thursday. Confirmation of the offer could kick off a bidding war for Shire, with sector bankers expecting the group to also prove appealing to U.S. pharmaceutical and biotech firms such as Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N), Amgen (AMGN.O), Gilead (GILD.O) and Biogen (BIIB.O). Shire's share price was up 15 percent at over 43 pounds by 1150 GMT, valuing the firm at over 25 billion pounds ($43 billion). Shire said the rejected offer comprised 0.7988 AbbVie shares and 20.44 pounds in cash for every Shire share.AbbVie, which has a market capitalisation of around $86 billion, said it made an initial cash and share proposal in early May with an indicative value of 39.50 pounds per share. It did not describe the latest offer as final, meaning it could come back with an even higher price and has been given a deadline under UK takeover rules to either make a firm intention to make an offer, or walk away, by 1600 GMT on July 18. However, analysts at Barclays said that the cost synergies and tax inversion benefits of the existing offer could be limited.""With no obvious therapeutic overlaps between AbbVie and Shire, the prospect for cost savings appears limited to us,"" they said. ""We would view Shire as very much a bolt-on acquisition for AbbVie, albeit one with a $47 billion price tag.""We also believe the cash component of AbbVie’s current proposal is on the cusp of what it can come up with,"" the analysts said, adding, however, that a deal would help AbbVie to become less reliant on its rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira.Shire, which specialises in medicines for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and drugs to treat rare genetic disorders, was previously approached by Botox-maker Allergan (AGN.N) months before the U.S. group itself became a takeover target for Valeant (VRX.TO).

38,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Olivia Oran  Aetna Inc, the third largest U.S. health insurer, is exploring a sale of some of Coventry Health Care Inc's assets worth as much as $1.5 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, a year after it acquired its rival for $5.6 billion.Aetna is working with Bank of America Merrill Lynch on a sale process for Coventry's workers' compensation business that is expected to attract interest from other companies in the sector as well as private equity firms.Aetna and Bank of America Merrill Lynch declined to comment. The sale process reaffirms that Aetna's acquisition of Coventry was always about boosting its share of the fast-growing, U.S. government-backed Medicare and Medicaid programs.Aetna has its own workers' compensation business called Workers' Comp Access. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company completed the acquisition of Coventry in May 2013.  The business for sale offers cost and care management services to underwriters and administrators of workers' compensation insurance, as well as employers.  The health insurance claims services sector has seen robust deal activity in the past year, including Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg's Starr Investment Holdings LLC-led $4.4 billion takeover of MultiPlan Inc and Apax Partners LLP's more than $3 billion acquisition of One Call Care Management Inc and Align Networks Inc.

39,"   By Megan Davies | MOSCOW  MOSCOW U.S. healthcare firm Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) is to buy Russian drugmaker Veropharm VRPH.MM for up to $495 million, giving it a manufacturing presence in a country where it has been operating for nearly 40 years, Abbott said on Tuesday.The deal bucks a drought in Russian M&A activity this year due to the country's faltering economy and the Ukraine crisis. U.S. companies have been particularly stymied from investing here with Washington advising top executives to steer clear of a major Russian investment forum in May. Abbott's purchase is the largest acquisition by a U.S. company in Russia since Philip Morris International Inc (PM.N) and Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) in December announced plans to buy stakes in cigarette distributor Megapolis for $750 million each, according to Thomson Reuters data. Shares in Veropharm, one of Russia's biggest drugmakers with a market capitalization of $300 million, shot up 34 percent to a three-year high by early afternoon trading in Moscow.""Russia's middle class is growing and when the middle class grows the sector that grows is healthcare,"" said one trader. ""There is an aging population and it is a country that really needs good pharma. If you want to get a part of that market you've got to be a local producer and this is a way for Abbott to be locally producing.""  It is the latest foray by Abbott into emerging markets, following a $2.9 billion deal earlier in the year to buy Chile's CFR Pharmaceuticals SA CFR.SN. Abbott, which sells healthcare devices and branded generics in 150 countries, last year split into two businesses and spun off its blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug in a new company, AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N). It has said it plans to focus the branded generics business on about 14 or 15 fast-growing emerging markets.Under the deal, Abbott will buy Garden Hills, a holding company which owns a controlling interest in Veropharm, for a range of $395 million to $495 million, depending on Garden Hills' ownership of Veropharm at the time of closure, Abbott said.  Garden Hills currently owns more than 80 percent of Veropharm but is expected to own more than 95 percent when the deal closes, Abbott said. Abbott will assume net debt of $136 million and plans to fund the transaction with cash on the balance sheet, it said. It expects the deal, to close in the fourth quarter, to add $150 million in sales in 2015. The Illinois-based company, which has been operating in Russia since 1978, said the deal would allow it to establish a manufacturing presence in the country. Veropharm has three pharmaceutical manufacturing sites in Pokrov, Belgorod and Voronezh. Abbott employs 1,400 staff in Russia in research and development, logistics, sales and marketing, according to its website.

45,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. healthcare companies are winning higher profit forecasts, bucking a wider trend on Wall Street, as pricey new biotech drugs hit the market and insurance enrollment rises under the Affordable Care Act.Analysts' profit expectations for the group have risen sharply since the start of the year, while estimates for most of the other nine Standard & Poor's 500 macro sectors have fallen, according to Thomson Reuters data.The jump in forecasts has come in the past two months, thanks largely to rising estimates for biotechnology companies such as Gilead (GILD.O), and for insurers, including Aetna (AET.N).It provides some early evidence that President Barack Obama's signature healthcare overhaul could be a long-term source of profit growth for managed care providers.""Now you're actually seeing real numbers grow and that population start to take off,"" said Betsy Pecor, portfolio manager at Eagle Asset Management, based in St. Petersburg, Florida. Companies ""are actually seeing that growth.""About 8 million people have signed up for the plans, which are provided by commercial subscribers and come with income-based government subsidies, above the 2 million who had enrolled by January.Aetna and other insurers have said they lost money on the plans this year, but insurers are heading into new markets for 2015 to add customers.Many healthcare companies are better able to manage Obamacare now than they were last year, Pecor said.EXCEEDS FORECASTS Profit estimates for healthcare companies for 2014 have jumped from up 8.3 percent at the start of January to up 12.2 percent now, one of just a few sectors with a 2014 earnings outlook that exceeds profit-growth forecasts at the start of the year, Thomson Reuters data showed.Earnings growth estimates for the whole S&P 500 this year have gone down slightly in that period, from 10.8 percent in January to 9.1 percent now.

46,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. healthcare companies are winning higher profit forecasts, bucking a wider trend on Wall Street, as pricey new biotech drugs hit the market and insurance enrollment rises under the Affordable Care Act.Analysts' profit expectations for the group have risen sharply since the start of the year, while estimates for most of the other nine Standard & Poor's 500 macro sectors have fallen, according to Thomson Reuters data.The jump in forecasts has come in the past two months, thanks largely to rising estimates for biotechnology companies such as Gilead, and for insurers, including Aetna.It provides some early evidence that President Barack Obama's signature healthcare overhaul could be a long-term source of profit growth for managed care providers.""Now you're actually seeing real numbers grow and that population start to take off,"" said Betsy Pecor, portfolio manager at Eagle Asset Management, based in St. Petersburg, Florida. Companies ""are actually seeing that growth.""About 8 million people have signed up for the plans, which are provided by commercial subscribers and come with income-based government subsidies, above the 2 million who had enrolled by January.Aetna and other insurers have said they lost money on the plans this year, but insurers are heading into new markets for 2015 to add customers.Many healthcare companies are better able to manage Obamacare now than they were last year, Pecor said.EXCEEDS FORECASTS Profit estimates for healthcare companies for 2014 have jumped from up 8.3 percent at the start of January to up 12.2 percent now, one of just a few sectors with a 2014 earnings outlook that exceeds profit-growth forecasts at the start of the year, Thomson Reuters data showed.

47,"  WELLINGTON, July 11 New Zealand dairy co-operative Fonterra and U.S. healthcare company Abbott are planning to build up to five dairy farms in China to secure domestic supply to meet rising demand for milk in the world's second-largest economy.In a statement issued on Friday, the world's largest dairy exporter and Abbott, a major infant formula seller in China, said they had signed a $300 million agreement to build up the  farms in one of the world's fastest growing dairy markets, which would produce up to 160 million litres of milk each year.The planned hub, whose location is yet to be decided, would be Fonterra's third, following similar dairying centres in China's Shanxi and Hebei provinces. If the plan is approved by Chinese authorities, the companies said the first farm would begin producing in early 2017.""Farming hubs are a key part of our strategy to be a more integrated dairy business in Greater China, contribute to the growth and development of the local Chinese dairy industry and help meet local consumers' needs for safe, nutritious dairy products,"" Fonterra Chief Executive Officer Theo Spierings said in a statement. The deal would build on the existing relationship between the two companies, as Fonterra counts Abbott as a wholesale client of its milk powder products, which include Similac infant formula brand.Abbott is expanding its production capabilities in China, opening an infant formula plant near Shanghai in June. ""This strategic partnership gives us flexibility for the future on however we use milk,"" an Abbott spokesman said.Abbott recalled some of its milk formula brands in China and Vietnam in August after a contamination scare involving  products containing Fonterra-produced ingredients, which proved to be false. Abbott in April said the recall crimped sales of milk formula products by $75 million in the first quarter.Global milk formula makers are pushing to capitalise on increasing dairy demand from China, where growing middle classes are developing a voracious appetite for cheese, milk formula and other products.(Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)",2014-07-10,AET,"Thu Jul 10, 2014 | 6:30pm EDT","Fonterra, Abbott to build dairy farms in China",http://www.reuters.com//article/abbott-fonterra-china-idUSL4N0PL5JI20140710?type=companyNews
48,"   By Sharon Begley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK In one of the largest tests of a novel way to deliver and pay for healthcare, insurer CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield announced on Thursday that 1.1 million people receiving care through its ""patient-centered medical homes"" last year were hospitalized less often and stayed for fewer days compared to patients in traditional fee-for-service care.Medical homes, a centerpiece of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform, have been heralded as one of the best hopes for reducing the cost of U.S. healthcare, the highest in the world, and improving its quality, which lags that of many other wealthy countries.Medical homes are basically groups of primary-care providers who pledge to coordinate care, adhere to guidelines meant to improve patients' health, and avoid unnecessary tests, among other steps.According to CareFirst, its medical home program, in its fourth year, also delivered high-quality care, measured by yardsticks such as whether doctors gave recommended cancer screenings and immunizations. The organization said it saved $130 million or 3.5 percent compared to projected spending under standard fee-for-service.The savings reached a level ""I wouldn't have thought possible,"" said CareFirst President Chet Burrell. The non-profit covers 3.4 million people in Maryland, Washington, D.C., and northern Virginia. Providers who hit the mark receive higher reimbursements from CareFirst: 12 percent above the standard rate just for participating in the medical home program and up to 36 percent more for quality outcomes. A physician could therefore receive $148 for a procedure usually reimbursed at $100.The insurer can afford that because better primary care, which accounts for just 6 percent of all medical spending, can reduce hospitalizations and visits to expensive specialists.A key element of the medical homes model is data, including information about which specialists are especially pricey, and electronic medical records alerting doctors about check-ups, medications and other care for patients with chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes. The $130 million in savings was driven largely by 6.4 percent fewer hospital admissions, 11 percent fewer hospital days and 11 percent fewer visits to outpatient facilities.The last reflects the fact that medical homes have evening and weekend hours, so patients don't need to visit clinics and emergency rooms for non-urgent care after-hours. Medical homes have not been uniformly assessed as successful, however. A study of 32 of them, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association this year, found they did not reduce hospitalizations or costs and missed 10 of 11 quality goals.Other studies have been more encouraging, said Marci Nielsen, chief executive of the Patient-Centered Primary Care Collaborative. A year ago, BlueCross Blue Shield of Michigan reported its medical-home program saved $155 million and cut both emergency-room visits and hospital stays.The varying results underline the need to identify which aspects of medical homes such as being open on weekends and evenings or aggressively managing the care of the sickest patients - are key, she said.

53,"  * Main Medicare fund seen lasting into 2030* Disability insurance fund could run dry in 2016   (Adds comments by trustees, officials and background)By Jason Lange and David MorganWASHINGTON, July 28 Tamer spending at U.S. hospitals and expected savings from President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul are shoring up the funding outlook for the Medicare program for the elderly, trustees of the program said on Monday.Medicare's trust fund for hospital bills will run out of money in 2030, four years later than previously estimated, the trustees said in a report. The trustees, however, reiterated a warning that the Social Security program would run out of money to fully pay disability benefits by 2016 and could not meet all of its obligations on pensions after 2033.The report gives mixed messages about the urgency of reforming America's biggest social welfare programs, which together make up about 40 percent of federal spending. While the arrival date for Medicare's crunch has been pushed into the future, an aging population is already stressing the finances of programs that provide income for the disabled.""The long-term picture this year looks very similar to last year's report. The short-term picture has grown more urgent,"" Charles Blahous, the lone Republican on the board of trustees, said at a news conference.U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, who is one of the trustees, said the disability program could be temporarily patched up by Congress redirecting revenues from another Social Security fund. That would buy time to work out a long-term solution, he said. A partisan divide in Washington has made major reforms of Medicare and Social Security appear nigh impossible in recent years. Republicans want to rein in government spending, while Lew said Obama will not support any proposal that hits current beneficiaries or that slashes benefits for future retirees.The trustees said the Medicare hospital fund would last longer than previously thought because ""expenditures in 2013 were significantly lower than the previous estimate."" They said it wasn't clear how much of the slowdown was because of a weak economy and how much was due to Obama's healthcare overhaul, which is expanding insurance coverage. Nevertheless, the trustees said they expected ""substantial"" savings from Obamacare. The trustees said congressional action was still needed to address long-term solvency in Medicare and Social Security.""The sooner the policymakers address these challenges, the less disruptive the unavoidable adjustments will be,"" said trustee Robert Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.The report's conclusions largely mirrored those made earlier this month by the nonpartisan CBO, which also pushed back to 2030 its projection of when Medicare's main trust fund would be exhausted.Depletion of the Medicare and Social Security trust funds does not mean that all benefits would stop. At the current rate of payroll tax collections, for example, Medicare would be able to pay about 85 percent of costs in 2030.Social Security would be able to pay about 80 percent of disability benefits starting in ""late 2016,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement.

54,"  (Rewrites throughout with commentary on medical costs, industry share moves)By Caroline HumerJuly 29 Aetna Inc, the third-largest U.S. health insurer, reported a rise in medical costs on Tuesday, raising investor concerns that a long run of low growth in such costs might be ending and pushing shares in the industry lower.U.S. insurer profits have benefited from several years of relatively low use of medical services by their members due to an economic downturn and higher out-of-pocket costs for patients.Aetna said its medical spending rose in the second quarter due to an expensive new treatment for hepatitis C made by Gilead Sciences and the higher costs of covering patients who bought insurance under President Barack Obama's healthcare law for the first time.The insurer said that it spent 83.1 percent of the premiums it took in on medical claims, a measure called medical benefit ratio, higher than some Wall Street estimates. It said that ratio increased from 82.5 percent a year earlier. Aetna shares fell 3.4 percent to $81.94 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Among rivals, UnitedHealth Group slipped 1.7 percent, WellPoint Inc  dropped 2.9 percent and Humana Inc slid 3 percent.Aetna executives said the quarter did not represent a new trend and that they expect 2014 medical spending to be at the low end of company forecasts. But investors were skeptical, and cited evidence of higher medical costs when UnitedHealth reported its quarterly profits last week.""Investors are concerned that cost trend is creeping up,"" Jefferies & Co analyst David Windley said. Industry analysts also pointed to the financial performance of U.S. hospitals as another sign that medical use is up. After years of low utilization, hospitals such as HCA Holdings Inc  have reported quarterly profits that blew past Wall Street expectations.Aetna's chief financial officer said its data did not show any reason for concern.""When we look at our core business and we look at medical cost trends in the second quarter, everything looks very well behaved,"" CFO Shawn Guertin said in an interview. ""The (cost ratios) are actually down year over year."" Cost increases are tied to the new Obamacare exchange business and the new hepatitis C treatment Sovaldi, he said. The drug was approved in December and costs $84,000 for a 12-week treatment that cures most patients who take it.Aetna second-quarter profit was boosted by Medicare and Medicaid provider Coventry Health Care. Excluding costs related to that purchase in 2014, earnings were $1.69 per share, above the $1.60 per share that analysts had anticipated.The insurer raised its 2014 earnings forecast due to greater profits created by the deal, predicting a range of $6.45 to $6.60 per share from $6.35 to $6.55.Aetna's second-quarter net income rose to $549 million, or $1.52 per share, from $536 million, or $1.49 per share, a year earlier.Revenue rose to $14.5 billion from $11.5 billion.

In addition to Moscow's ban on imports of many Western foods, following sanctions imposed for Russia's support of rebels in eastern Ukraine, investors worried that the conflict between Russian and Ukraine is escalating, with the downing of a Ukrainian fighter jet. .The declines briefly dragged the Dow below its 200-day moving average in afternoon trading. The S&P 500 is now nearly 4 percent below the record closing high it set last monthWhile the full extent of the sanctions are still unknown, escalating tensions in Russia could continue to spur selling in stocks, analysts said. ""Before this point, U.S. investors have always thought of geopolitical concerns as being largely no more than a 24-hour event. Now, the growing concern is that the outlook for global growth is pointing down,"" said Andrew Wilkinson, chief market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut.""To that extent, investors seem more prone to selling, and asking questions later rather than buying the dip as they had become accustomed to doing in the past.""All but one of the S&P 500's industry sectors ended down on the day, backtracking from brief gains in the morning.

The equity market has fluctuated for much of the past two weeks, and investors see few reasons to commit more capital, analysts said.""We've been all over the place,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.""There's just not enough market participants to absorb either the demand for stocks when people are buying or demand for buyers when they're selling."" Consumer staples shares, the bright spot of trading on Wednesday, slipped 0.6 percent on Thursday. All but one of the benchmark index's 10 sectors were lower, backtracking from brief gains in the morning that were fueled by earnings reports and employment data.Still, while sanctions could hurt European economies which have closer trading ties to Russia, some analysts believed the measures were unlikely to make a significant dent on U.S. equities.""Russia isn't that large a trading partner for the U.S., except for things like poultry, so I think specific stocks could get hit by the overall market, probably not,"" Forrest said. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 51.98 points, or 0.32 percent, to 16,391.36, the S&P 500 was down 6.41 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,913.83 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 6.05 points, or 0.14 percent, to 4,349.00.iDreamSky Technology shares jumped as high as 27 percent to $19.05 in the mobile game company's trading debut, blowing past its IPO price of $15 per share.

It has closed below that level just four times this year, the last one in mid April. Markets kept an eye on eastern Europe as Moscow imposed a ban on imports of many Western foods, retaliating against sanctions imposed for its support of rebels in eastern Ukraine and the annexation of Crimea. Russia will ban various imports from the United States, the European Union, Australia, Canada and Norway in a measure that isolates its consumers from world trade to a degree unseen since Soviet days.""The Russian situation has gone from bad to worse,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, adding that ""imposing an import restriction on agricultural products will likely lead to rapid inflation.""However, he said the recent volatility and pullback are not foreshadowing a market correction. ""Earnings are robust, revenues are rising, and interest rates are likely to go up gradually,"" Jacobsen said. ""These are not the conditions that create market corrections.""The sanctions by Moscow are seen as possibly hurting European economies more than the United States due to closer ties between Russia and Europe. Such a scenario could favor U.S. equities and other assets as foreign cash looking for yield may head towards the world's largest economy. The full extent of the impact, however, is yet to be known.""Geopolitical risks are heightened, are higher than they were a few months ago.

64,"   By David Lawder | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. healthcare spending is expected to grow more slowly in the coming decade as a sluggish economic recovery and higher cost sharing in private insurance plans limit demand for services, a government report released on Wednesday said.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid said it expects average annual healthcare spending to grow by 5.7 percent from 2013 to 2023, compared to 5.8 percent in last year's projections, which covered the years 2012 to 2022.The projected growth rate is well below the 7.2 percent annual average between 1990 and 2008, CMS said.The projections coincide with Congressional Budget Office estimates released last week that show another $11 billion reduction in projected spending for Medicare, the federal healthcare program for the elderly, for the 2015-24 period. This reduction from projections made in February contributes directly to lower federal deficits. The CMS study projects both public and private healthcare outlays and showed the overall total will make up a smaller portion of the economy than previously thought in coming years. In 2023, it estimated that healthcare spending will equal 19.3 percent of Gross Domestic Product, compared with last year's projection of 19.9 percent for 2022. It made up 17.2 percent of GDP in 2012.The spending growth rate for 2013 will be 3.6 percent, nearly at the historic low since CMS started tracking health care spending in 1960.For 2014, the spending growth will accelerate to 5.6 percent as more people gain healthcare coverage under President Barack Obama's health insurance reform law, largely through its expansion of Medicaid, and because of an increase in economic growth. But this will still be below last year's estimate of 6.1 percent growth for 2014. ""The major factor is the relationship between health spending and economic growth,"" said Andrea Sisko, an economist in the CMS actuarial division.Loss of jobs and associated healthcare benefits tend to discourage healthcare utilization, she said, adding that employment has been slow to recover. Another deterrent has been the increase in healthcare plans that require beneficiaries to bear a greater proportion of costs for doctor visits, procedures and prescription drugs. Medicare reimbursement rates also have been curtailed by the ""sequester"" budget cuts and by the Affordable Care Act, and prescription drug costs have eased because patents on a number of major medications have expired in recent years, making cheaper generic versions available.But as the economy improves and more Baby Boomers retire and draw benefits, spending growth is still expected to pick up, averaging 6.0 percent from 2015-23, CMS said.

But I don’t expect there will be a second bid,"" Sebastien Buch, a portfolio manager at Union Investment which owns roughly 3 percent of Nobel Biocare’s shares, told Reuters. Danaher is a leading provider of dental equipment, but only a small player in the fragmented dental implants market after its acquisition of low-cost manufacturer Implant Direct.The purchase of Nobel Biocare, the world's No.2 dental implants maker, will bring Danaher a premium range of implants and boost its dental business to sales of around $3 billion.Vontobel analysts forecast the global dental implants market is set to double to $6 billion by 2025, helped by recovering Western economies and rising incomes in developing countries.Danaher President and Chief Executive Thomas P. Joyce told a conference call that Nobel Biocare's recent investment in high-growth markets such as China, eastern Europe and Latin America - which now make up about 20 percent of sales - had made it an attractive opportunity.Fellow dental implant players such as Henry Schein (HSIC.O) and Dentsply (XRAY.O) had been cited as possible bidders for Nobel Biocare, while the company had reportedly also attracted interest from buyout group EQT Partners. Analysts at Berenberg said it was ""by no means a certainty"" that Nobel Biocare's shareholders would agree to tender their shares at Danaher's price, adding it was possible that other potential suitors could enter the fray with a higher offer.The deal, recommended by Nobel Biocare's board, requires the acceptance of 67 percent of Nobel Biocare's shareholders.But other analysts said the price was fair and counter bids looked unlikely. Swiss rival Straumann (STMN.S) ruled out interest in Nobel Biocare last month, while Zimmer ZMH.N is busy with its purchase of Biomet Inc for more than $13 billion. ""Nobel has run an extensive sales process and we believe that Nobel is less attractive for private equity in light of its weak cash flow and no synergy opportunities,"" said Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Ed Ridley-Day.Joyce said Danaher expected the deal to help it deliver a 10 percent return on invested capital (ROIC) by 2019. It expects the deal to add five cents to earnings per share by 2015 and ten cents by 2016. MEDTECH M&A The Nobel Biocare deal follows on from a wave of mergers among medical supplies makers this year, including Medtronic Inc's (MDT.N) $42.9 billion deal to buy Dublin-based Covidien Plc COV.N in June. Like other makers of premium implants, Nobel Biocare has struggled since the financial crisis as cash-strapped consumers, particularly in southern Europe, cut back on pricey dental work which is not generally reimbursed by insurers.Nobel Biocare's stock is down 80 percent since its all-time high in 2007. The company grappled with years of sliding sales and dwindling market share as it faced competition from a growing number of so-called ""value"" players. But signs have grown that a long-awaited turnaround is taking root and the company has notched up five consecutive quarters of revenue growth at constant exchange rates.Although the premium market is growing at a slower pace than the value segment, Danaher said it still expects dentists to prefer premium implants for complex cases. It expects the premium segment to keep growing in the 3-5 percent range.Nobel Biocare had sales of 567 million euros ($735 million) and net profit of 42.6 million euros in 2013. It has $556 million of bonds and loans.Danaher said Nobel Biocare would continue to operate as a standalone company and maintain its own brand and identity. The deal is expected to be completed in late 2014 or early 2015. Nobel Biocare was advised by Goldman Sachs, while Credit Suisse acted as financial adviser and offer manager to Danaher.At 1315 GMT (9.15 a.m. EDT), Nobel Biocare shares were down 5.5 percent at 17.1 Swiss francs.

70,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has published a new report detailing  key credit metrics of nine-publicly-traded U.S. health insurance and managed  care companies that are either rated or followed by Fitch: Aetna, Inc., Centene  Corp., Cigna Corp., Health Net Inc., Humana, Inc., Molina Health Care Inc.  UnitedHealth Group, Incorporated, WellCare Health Plans, Inc. and WellPoint,  Inc.  The report is meant to be used as a desktop guide, providing financial data and  rankings, key credit strengths and concerns, and current ratings levels and  rating sensitivities. Fitch views the key credit metrics of these nine publicly traded health insurers  as improving in the first half of 2014 compared to the prior year period. Strong  revenue growth driven by the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) exchanges and Medicaid  expansion, continuing popularity of Medicare Advantage products and  acquisition-related growth generated increases in EBITDA that more than offset  declining margins. Interest coverage ratios improved, and leverage ratios  declined modestly. The first section of the report includes company rankings based on revenue  growth, EBITDA margin and returns on capital as well as capitalization measures  such as debt-to-EBITDA and financial leverage. The second section of the report  provides a more detailed discussion of the nine individual companies including  credit strengths and concerns, ratings and rating triggers (where applicable),  and detailed information about each company's capital structure.

73,"   By Gene Emery | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - For decades, it's been the conventional wisdom that U.S. healthcare costs are high because doctors order expensive tests to protect themselves from malpractice lawsuits, but new evidence says that assumption is wrong.The study from the RAND Corporation found that in three states where the laws were rewritten to make it virtually impossible to sue a doctor for mistakes, the cost of care did not go down in hospital emergency departments.""If your goal is cost savings, if you believe there is a lot of pure waste going on, then malpractice reform is a blind alley,"" Dr. Daniel Waxman, chief author of the study, told Reuters Health by phone.The idea that defensive medicine is responsible for higher health costs ""has come up over and over and over again,"" said Waxman, of Rand HEALTH in Santa Monica, California. ""It distracts people from looking for other avenues"" that might bring costs down more effectively.A 2010 study even pegged the cost of needless care motivated by fear of malpractice lawsuits at $210 billion a year.The new study in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at costs before and after Georgia, Texas and South Carolina changed their laws to only allow emergency department doctors to be sued for gross negligence, in which the doctor knows that a treatment will likely cause serious injury, yet does it anyway. ""People say the letter of that law is an almost-impossible threshold to meet,"" although such decisions are ultimately left up to the courts, said Waxman, who is an emergency department physician.The team's analysis of more than 3.8 million Medicare records from 1,166 hospitals also included neighboring states where the standard of malpractice remained ordinary negligence, which is a failure to exercise reasonable care.""If you ask physicians, 'Do you practice defensively?' They overwhelmingly say, 'Yes we do.' They say they order more CT scans and MRIs. They admit people to the hospital. That certainly is a long-standing belief among physicians and lay people at this point,"" said Dr. Waxman. But when the team examined emergency room bills and the likelihood that the patients would be admitted to the hospital or receive a CT or MRI scan, Waxman and his colleagues found no difference in nearly every measure before and after the three states changed their laws.Only in Georgia did they see any shift - a 3.6 percent drop in the average emergency room charge compared to neighboring states after the Peach State revised its law in 2005.""Although there was a small reduction in charges in one of the three states (Georgia), our results in aggregate suggest that these strongly protective laws caused little (if any) change in practice intensity among physicians caring for Medicare patients in emergency departments,"" the researchers conclude in the report. The new laws may not have changed how doctors practice, but in Texas the 2003 reforms cut the number of malpractice lawsuits by 60 percent and the total of malpractice payments by 70 percent. ""This certainly runs counter to most people's expectation,"" Waxman said. ""Basically, there are a whole bunch of things going on. No doctor wants to be sued. But doctors also don't want to make mistakes. They don't want to cause harm. They don't want to say no to patients. So everything favors doing more. There are reasons to be faulted for not doing more, and very little pushback if you don't.""""It's easy to blame something that's out of your control,"" he said, ""and the legal system is a convenient scapegoat.""SOURCE: bit.ly/Zrpqde New England Journal of Medicine, online October 15, 2014.",2014-10-15,AET,"Wed Oct 15, 2014 | 5:31pm EDT",Malpractice laws that favor doctors fail to cut health costs: study,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-healthcare-costs-malpractice-law-idUSKCN0I42OR20141015?type=companyNews
74,"  (Repeats with no change to text)By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO Oct 16 The infection of two U.S. healthcare workers who cared for a dying Ebola patient in Dallas is challenging assumptions about how to protect Western medical workers who perform advanced, life-saving procedures that may increase their risk of exposure.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the infection of the two Dallas nurses likely occurred in the first few days of patient Thomas Duncan's admission to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in late September, and is investigating whether they correctly used personal protective gear such as gloves and gowns recommended by the agency.Workers at the hospital also performed invasive procedures on Duncan such as inserting a breathing tube and filtering his blood through a dialysis machine, procedures that are unprecedented in the care of an Ebola patient in the last throes of the disease. But those same procedures make it more likely that a healthcare worker will come into contact with bodily fluids at their most infectious.""The thing we don't know is, was it truly a breakdown in personal protective equipment or was it because we were instrumenting the patient by intubation or dialysis?"" said Dr Peter Hotez, a tropical disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.In West Africa, where the worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed more than 4,000 people, the use of advanced lifesaving measures is rarely an option. But in the United States, they are routine.""We tend to go to the mat"" in an effort to save patients, Hotez said. ""Should we rethink whether we should be doing these life-saving measures? That is a question that medicine needs to address."" In most places in Africa, Ebola patients are only able to get supportive care, said CDC spokeswoman Abbigail Tumpey.""Now that we're treating patients with Ebola in the U.S., we are using modern Western medicine that has not ever been used in field studies in Africa,"" she said. Treatment approaches such as dialysis and intubation ""certainly have not been happening.""Tumpey said the CDC is now looking at the risks associated with these procedures.""Because we don't have experience with treating patients with Ebola in U.S. hospitals where we have all of this technology and resources, it's possible that some of these procedures may put healthcare workers more at risk."" Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University Medical Center said that despite the fact Ebola has been around for decades, it is ""entirely new to Western healthcare,"" and it is important to not be overly reliant on what has worked in prior outbreaks, especially when the healthcare systems are so dissimilar.GREATER BENEFIT OR HARM? To many, the questions Ebola is raising are reminiscent of the early days of caring for patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Many of the safety protocols developed for blood-borne pathogens were developed through caring for AIDS patients. But Ebola is different in some very important ways. It rapidly turns off the body's innate ability to fight viruses, multiplying unchecked as the disease progresses until patients' bodies are filled with billions of virus particles.""Towards the last days of infection, that patient is basically a bag of virus,"" Hotez said.When a patient with Ebola is reaching the stage in the disease where there is need for intubation or dialysis, the risk becomes greater to the healthcare worker than the benefit to the patient because they are ""crashing"" and near death.""If it's that late a stage in the disease, the chances are that even if those are performed, the patient is already going to die,"" said Sean Kaufman, president of Behavioral-Based Improvement Solutions in Atlanta, who helps train hospital staff on safety measures.Dr. Marc Napp, deputy chief medical officer and senior vice president for medical affairs at Mount Sinai Health System in New York, said that as a general rule ""any patient that comes in, no matter what the condition, if they require certain medical therapy based upon clinical judgment and they want that therapy, we are obligated to provide it.""Napp said in the case of Ebola, there has not been any discussion about withholding life-saving treatments such as intubation for fear of harming staff members. But he said healthcare workers take risks all of the time.""I'm a general surgeon. I've stuck myself with a needle. I've cut my finger on a broken bone from a person with hepatitis. We're exposed to this regularly,"" he said. ""What's different here is there is the panic factor. It's a highly lethal infection.""

76,"   By Julie Steenhuysen | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Oct 16 The infection of two U.S. healthcare workers who cared for a dying Ebola patient in Dallas is challenging assumptions about how to protect Western medical workers who perform advanced, life-saving procedures that may increase their risk of exposure.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the infection of the two Dallas nurses likely occurred in the first few days of patient Thomas Duncan's admission to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in late September, and is investigating whether they correctly used personal protective gear such as gloves and gowns recommended by the agency.Workers at the hospital also performed invasive procedures on Duncan such as inserting a breathing tube and filtering his blood through a dialysis machine, procedures that are unprecedented in the care of an Ebola patient in the last throes of the disease. But those same procedures make it more likely that a healthcare worker will come into contact with bodily fluids at their most infectious.""The thing we don't know is, was it truly a breakdown in personal protective equipment or was it because we were instrumenting the patient by intubation or dialysis?"" said Dr Peter Hotez, a tropical disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.In West Africa, where the worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed more than 4,000 people, the use of advanced lifesaving measures is rarely an option. But in the United States, they are routine.""We tend to go to the mat"" in an effort to save patients, Hotez said. ""Should we rethink whether we should be doing these life-saving measures? That is a question that medicine needs to address.""In most places in Africa, Ebola patients are only able to get supportive care, said CDC spokeswoman Abbigail Tumpey. ""Now that we're treating patients with Ebola in the U.S., we are using modern Western medicine that has not ever been used in field studies in Africa,"" she said. Treatment approaches such as dialysis and intubation ""certainly have not been happening.""Tumpey said the CDC is now looking at the risks associated with these procedures.""Because we don't have experience with treating patients with Ebola in U.S. hospitals where we have all of this technology and resources, it's possible that some of these procedures may put healthcare workers more at risk."" Dr. Jesse Goodman of Georgetown University Medical Center said that despite the fact Ebola has been around for decades, it is ""entirely new to Western healthcare,"" and it is important to not be overly reliant on what has worked in prior outbreaks, especially when the healthcare systems are so dissimilar.GREATER BENEFIT OR HARM?

81,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'A' Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of Aetna Inc. (Aetna) and the 'AA-' Insurer Financial Strength  (IFS) ratings of various Aetna insurance operating subsidiaries. The Rating  Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative. A complete list of ratings is  included at the end of this release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's revision of Aetna's Outlook reflects the company's favorable fulfillment  of conditions established when a Negative Outlook was placed on the ratings upon  Aetna's completion of its acquisition of Coventry Health Care, Inc. (CVH) in May  2013. Specifically, the company has made substantial progress over the past year  in returning to debt-to-EBITDA and financial leverage metrics within Fitch's  guidelines for the company's current ratings. Debt-to-EBITDA has declined from  2.2x in first half 2013 to 1.6x in first half 2014 relative to a rating  sensitivity of 1.8x, and financial leverage has declined from 40% at June 30,  2013 to 37% at June 30, 2014, and is expected to be approximately 36% at  year-end 2014 relative to a rating sensitivity of 35%. Fitch expects Aetna to  report financial leverage of 35% during 2015. Aetna's ratings reflect the organization's major market position and significant  size and scale, strong profitability and interest coverage, and generally solid  balance sheet characteristics. The ratings also reflect what Fitch considers to be modest deterioration in  Aetna's capitalization metrics and ongoing sector-wide operational uncertainty  tied to the Affordable Care Act. Fitch considers Aetna to be a leading health insurance and managed care  organization due to the company's large membership, significant revenue and  earnings base, and strong competitive position. The breadth of Aetna's provider  network and its contracting capabilities are key competitive strengths.  Aetna generates consistently strong EBITDA-based profit margins and returns on  capital. From 2009 through 2013, the company's EBITDA margin and net  income-based return on equity averaged approximately 9% and 18%, respectively,  both of which are modestly above median guidelines for Aetna's rating  categories. This strong profitability, coupled with reasonable debt levels, has  resulted in solid EBITDA-based interest coverage ratios averaging approximately  12.5x over the past five years, despite a temporary increase in financial  leverage to fund its acquisition of CVH. Fitch views Aetna's statutory capitalization metrics as having deteriorated  moderately over the last 12-24 months. The company's organization-wide Fitch  adjusted NAIC risk-based capital (RBC) ratio, which excludes the impact of  excess of loss health reinsurance derived capital, declined to 255% at year-end  2013 from 262% at year-end 2012. Fitch expects the company to maintain an  adjusted RBC ratio above 260% of the company action level. Fitch's ratings on Aetna continue to reflect the risks derived from government  involvement in health insurance and managed care companies' ongoing business  activities. Fitch's long-held concern is that government efforts to advance  public policy goals could adversely affect health insurance and managed care  companies' ability to manage their business and hinder their ability to generate  cash flow supporting debt obligations.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The key rating triggers that could lead Fitch to upgrade the ratings include  run-rate: --EBITDA / revenue margin exceeding 10%; --EBITDA-based interest coverage ratios exceeding 14x; --Sustained run-rate debt-to-EBITDA ratios of less than 1.0x; --A sustained commitment to maintain a debt-to-capital ratio of less than 25%; --Organization-wide run-rate Fitch adjusted NAIC Risk-Based Capital (RBC) ratios  approximating 300%. The key rating triggers that could lead Fitch to downgrade the ratings include  run-rate: --Debt-to-EBITDA ratios that exceed 1.8x; --Debt-to-capital ratios that exceed 35%;  --EBITDA-to-revenue margins less than 7%; --EBITDA-based interest coverage ratios less than 10x or maximum allowable  dividend interest expense coverage below 5x; --Organization-wide run-rate Fitch adjusted NAIC risk-based capital (RBC) ratios  below 275%. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: --$228 million of 6.125% senior unsecured notes due Jan. 15, 2015 at 'A-'; --$250 million of 1.75% senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2017 at 'A-'; --$500 million of 1.5% senior unsecured notes due Nov. 15, 2017 at 'A-'; --$383 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2017 at 'A-'; --$496 million of 6.5% senior unsecured notes due Sept. 15, 2018 at 'A-'; --$375 million of 2.2% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2019 at 'A-'; --$750 million of 3.95% senior unsecured notes due Sept. 1, 2020 at 'A-'; --$500 million of 4.125% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2021 at 'A-'; --$600 million of 5.450% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021 at 'A-';  --$1 billion of 2.75% senior unsecured notes due Nov. 15, 2022 at 'A-'; --$771 million of 6.625% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2036 at 'A-'; --$534 million of 6.75% senior unsecured notes due Dec. 15, 2037 at 'A-'; --$500 million of 4.5% senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2042 at 'A-'; --$500 million of 4.125% senior unsecured notes due Nov. 15, 2042 at 'A-'; --$375 million of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2044 at 'A-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --$2 billion commercial paper program at 'F1'.

82,"   By Caroline Humer  Aetna Inc (AET.N), the third-largest U.S. health insurer, said on Tuesday it expects 2014 medical costs to increase at the high end of its forecasts, underpinning investor concerns that years of stabilized medical use could be ending.Shares in Aetna fell 2.2 percent and others insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and WellPoint Inc WLP.N also fell.Aetna said that in the third quarter, it experienced an unexpected rise in its medical cost ratio due to more spending on claims at companies with 50 to 300 employees, the price of new hepatitis C treatments, and the performance of the individual business. The company said it expects spending to pick up during the fourth quarter, a typical seasonal trend that occurs as people reach their insurance deductibles.Its 2014 medical spending trend forecast is now for an increase at the high end of the 6 to 7 percent range. For 2015, it said it is pricing premiums based on an expectation that spending will accelerate by another 50 to 100 basis points. Investors have been watching medical cost trends closely for any reversal of the low use of medical services in recent years.  Some hospitals have reported an uptick in use driven by a rebound in the economy. Others have said medical services use is up because of implementation of the national healthcare reform law. So far, Aetna said unexpected increases have been largely in areas like pharmaceutical cost and hospital outpatient use.""I wouldn't say we have gotten to the point where we are drawing a conclusion that there is a widespread move upwards in medical cost trends,"" Aetna Chief Financial Officer Shawn Guertin said. Aetna said third-quarter profit rose as the benefits of its Coventry government healthcare acquisition offset these higher medical costs.Aetna said the percentage of premiums collected that it spent on covering medical services increased 0.5 percentage points to 81 percent in its commercial business, which includes new individual health plans. For commercial and government businesses combined, the ratio fell to 82.3 percent from 83.1 percent.In 2014, Aetna began selling health insurance to individuals on the new healthcare exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act. Aetna said it has almost 600,000 new insurance exchange customers and that they have higher costs per patient than expected. But it said it began making a slight profit on the business during the third quarter as high volume helped defray fixed costs. Aetna reported net income of $594.5 million, or $1.67 per share, up from $518.6 million, or $1.38 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 13 percent to $14.7 billion, slightly above analysts' expectations.Aetna said operating earnings were $1.79 per share excluding transaction costs, beating analysts' expectations of $1.58.Aetna raised its 2014 earnings forecast to $6.60 to $6.70 per share from $6.45 to $6.60.

90,"   By Anna Ringstrom and Olof Swahnberg | STOCKHOLM  STOCKHOLM Securitas (SECUb.ST), the world's second-biggest security services firm, cut its forecast on Tuesday for costs related to U.S. healthcare reform, a further boost as it posted profit-beating quarterly profit.Securitas now sees staff costs in the United States, its biggest market, rising only 4-5 percent because of an obligation from 2015 to offer health care insurance to all employees as part of the Affordable Care Act.It had previously forecast an increase of 8-10 percent but now believes fewer staff than initially expected will sign up for the insurance.The Swedish firm is renegotiating contracts across the United States as a consequence of the new law. Eighty percent of its US contracts are now compliant, up from 60 percent at the end of the second quarter, it said. Shares in Securitas, whose biggest rival is British G4S (GFS.L), rose on the news, trading up 6.4 percent at 1114 GMT (6.14 a.m. EST).However, Chief Executive Alf Goransson cautioned that the remaining 20 percent of U.S. contracts that it aims to renegotiate by the end of the year would be the toughest ones to finalise.Securitas employs around 310,000 people around the world, with a third of them in the United States, Canada and Mexico. TECHNOLOGY DRIVE Securitas still gets the bulk of revenues from supplying guards but is pushing to expand its use of less labour-intensive technology such as smart cameras that can identify potential threats. American clients have however been unexpectedly reluctant to adopt such technologies, Goransson said.He said technology-based contracts account for a mere 2 percent of turnover in the United States. That makes the firm's target for them to comprise 18 percent of group turnover by the end of next year harder to achieve.""Crucial for reaching the target is that we get a reasonable share of technology solutions in the United States, and the share is by mid-October smaller than we had counted on,"" he told Reuters.In the third quarter technology based solutions accounted for 9.5 percent of group turnover, up from 9 percent in the second quarter and 8.5 percent in the first. Operating profit before amortisation at Securitas, which operates in 52 countries, grew to 962 million crowns ($130 million) from 892 million a year ago.That beat a forecast 923 million in a Reuters poll of analysts, helped by better than expected organic sales growth of 4 percent with Argentina, Norway, Turkey and the United States performing well.As flagged in a Reuters interview in August, Securitas   said on Tuesday it would reorganise its troubled operations in crisis-hit Spain, one of its biggest markets.The overhaul will consist in moving resources to technology based solutions -- which in Spain are nearing 20 percent of turnover -- and cutting costs.

96,"  FRANKFURT Germany's Fresenius Medical Care (FMEG.DE) said it agreed to take over Cogent Healthcare, a U.S. provider of specialist physicians to hospitals, as part of its drive to offer additional services linked to its core business of kidney dialysis.The takeover of Cogent, with $250 million in expected 2015 sales, will be carried out by Sound Inpatient Physicians, in which FMC earlier this year took a majority stake. FMC, which did not disclose financial terms, aims to build a $5 billion care-coordination business by 2020 to offer a wider range of care for the chronically ill as part of an initiative to almost double group sales to $28 billion by then.Medical insurers in the United States are gradually moving toward a system of lump-sum payments for taking care of dialysis patients rather than reimbursing individual drugs and services, which FMC believes requires it to broaden its offering. Insurers hope that the system, called care coordination or disease management, will encourage healthcare providers to work more diligently toward preventing medical complications and increase patients' compliance with treatment regimens.For Sound Inpatient with $500 million in annual revenue, FMC paid more than 1.5 times expected sales, taking a majority stake which a person familiar with the matter at the time said was above 80 percent, for a purchase price of $600 million. That sales multiple, if applied to the Cogent purchase, would suggest a purchase price of more than $375 million.The German group expects the Cogent deal to improve group earnings within 18-24 months after closing, taking into account transaction and integration costs as well as synergies.

99,"  NEW YORK Dec 3 U.S. healthcare spending last year increased 3.6 percent over 2012, the smallest rate of growth since 1960, government officials announced on Wednesday.The modest increase, down from the 4.1 percent increase from 2011 to 2012, continued a trend that began with the 2007-2009 recession, and is a dramatic change from the double-digit growth of a decade ago. It fed hopes that more price-conscious consumers, as well as policy initiatives like Obamacare, are reining in U.S. healthcare spending, the world's highest and a drag on both the federal budget and corporate balance sheets.Per capita growth slowed even more, from 3.4 percent in 2012 to 2.9 percent last year, found the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The analysis appears in the journal Health Affairs hereHealthcare spending in 2013 totaled $2.9 trillion, or $9,255 per person. It accounted for 17.4 percent of gross domestic product, the same percentage as it has since 2009. The analysis found that prices of doctor visits, hospital care, nursing homes and other healthcare services grew 1.3 percent, more slowly than the overall inflation rate of 1.5 percent.That modest increase likely reflects pressure that both private insurers and Medicare are putting on providers, as well as President Barack Obama's healthcare reform, which put checks on what providers charge Medicare, the government program for the elderly and disabled. Americans used hardly any more medical services in 2013 than in 2012, despite the aging and growth of the population. Use of such services rose 1 percent, after a 1.2 percent rise in 2012, largely due to lower growth in hospital care.The historically small rise in healthcare spending occurred across the board, in both private health insurance and Medicare. Premiums for private insurance rose 2.8 percent compared to 4 percent in 2012, reaching $961.7 billion. What private insurers paid out in claims ($846 billion) also rose more slowly: 2.8 percent vs. 4.4 percent in 2012, largely because of slower growth in spending for hospitals and doctors.Medicare spending rose 3.4 percent, compared to 4 percent growth in 2012, to $585.7 billion. Spending by the Medicaid program for the poor, however, rose 6.1 percent.CMS warned that healthcare spending will grow more sharply if economic growth accelerates.

100,"  Dec 4 The average monthly cost for a 2015 mid-tier health insurance plan in the 35 states that are part of Healthcare.gov rose about 2 percent to $222 for a 27-year old, the U.S. government said on Thursday.The figure represents the average premium for the second-lowest-cost silver plan, which is the benchmark plan used to set subsidy levels, the Department of Health and Human Services said. The report from its Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation covered the costs of plans sold on the website run by the federal government and created under the national healthcare reform law. The report did not include states that operate their own exchanges, such as California or New York. Enrollment for individual coverage opened on Nov. 15 and closes Feb. 15. So far, more than 350,000 new customers have selected plans for 2015. Last year, HHS also analyzed data for 48 states. It said that the average monthly cost, weighted for age distribution, was $328 for benchmark 2014 plans. It did not provide a comparable figure in the 2015 report.

104,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By Caroline HumerNEW YORK Dec 15 Healthcare companies including Aetna Inc, Mercer and Towers Watson Co have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to build exchanges that allow company employees to buy their own insurance, betting that Corporate America wants to get out of managing workers' health benefits.By last year, blue chip names like Sears Holding  and Walgreen Co had signed on and industry experts predicted that more than 20 percent of the nation's employees would soon buy their health insurance in this way, compared with less than 2 percent today. But Reuters interviews with nearly a dozen industry executives has found that no major U.S. company signed up their employees for the first time to a private health insurance exchange for 2015.Many of those executives expect a similar situation in 2016, as blue chip employers wait for proof that the new exchanges will save them enough money to warrant the switch, raising doubts about this new business model.""We have a lot of wait-and-see going on with large employers,"" said Brian Marcotte, chief executive of the National Business Group on Health, a lobbying group for large corporations. ""They are not quite sure yet how they will deliver on managing costs better.""U.S. employers provide health benefits for more than 160 million people, mostly by contracting with large health insurers to administer the healthcare benefits that the company funds, with contributions from employee-paid premiums. But as healthcare costs rose steadily, and President Barack Obama's healthcare law required coverage of more medical services, many sought ways to rein in those expenses.Private exchanges such as Aon Hewitt, part of Aon PLC , aim to be the Amazon.coms of the insurance world, where employees choose and pay for their own plans and competition helps keep prices down.Employers contribute a fixed dollar amount to help their workers buy coverage, but can save money by no longer managing the benefits within their companies. They are not directly related to the state-based Obamacare insurance exchanges that offer government-subsidized health plans.Since 2012, employers covering as many as 3 million people have signed on to use the exchanges.

NEW SENSE OF CAUTION Industry executives are now projecting more caution about when private exchanges will take off. Aon Hewitt said in October that it would lose money on its private exchange this year, after previously expecting the business to be mildly profitable. Aon didn't say how much money it would lose. Insurer Cigna Corp  will sell health plans on the Aon exchange in 2016.""This is coming.

Other insurance experts question whether the forecasts will ever materialize.""Private exchanges were over-hyped from the beginning,"" said Dan Mendelson, chief executive of healthcare research firm Avalere Health. Large employers enjoy significant leverage in negotiating down the price of benefits for the many members of their workforce, an advantage that an exchange can't match, he said.LARGE MOVE FOR LARGE COMPANIES Darden Restaurants Inc, owner of the Olive Garden chain, was one of the first large companies to move to Aon Hewitt's private exchange. Medical costs were rising 8 to 10 percent per year and it had used the same insurer for 15 years. In 2012, it made a ""leap of faith"" that Aon Hewitt could do a better job, said Danielle Kirgan, Darden's senior vice president for human resources.It took four months to overhaul Darden's benefits systems and explain the change to employees. The pay off has been lower year-over-year increases in healthcare spending. ""We have over three years of seeing rates, and they have been dramatically and consistently less,"" Kirgan said in an interview. Starbucks Corp, however, took a close look at the private exchanges to understand them, but has never planned to move its 136,000 employees.""What we tended to learn is that what we do is just easier and better for people,"" Starbucks Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead told Reuters.Large companies who are open to joining the exchanges are now asking to see at least two or three years, and as many as five years, of data on insurance premiums and medical claims from plans sold on the exchanges to be sure that there will not be a sudden increase in premiums to contend with, benefits consultants said.Some corporations also describe a sense of fatigue after several years of getting their coverage compliant with Obamacare and are loath to make additional changes in short order.Many have introduced health plans with high deductibles to shift costs to employees and want to see whether that will be enough to save money. They are also uncertain about what may be required of them if the Affordable Care Act is changed by a new Congress with Republican opponents of the law in charge.Aetna said last month it would spend $400 million to buy private exchange company Bswift and remain competitive against Aon and others.

107,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Healthcare companies including Aetna Inc, Mercer and Towers Watson & Co have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to build exchanges that allow company employees to buy their own insurance, betting that Corporate America wants to get out of managing workers' health benefits. By last year, blue chip names such as Sears Holding Corp and Walgreen Co had signed on and industry experts predicted that more than 20 percent of the nation's employees would soon buy their health insurance in this way, compared with less than 2 percent today. But Reuters interviews with nearly a dozen industry executives has found that no major U.S. company signed up their employees for the first time to a private health insurance exchange for 2015. Many of those executives expect a similar situation in 2016, as blue chip employers wait for proof that the new exchanges will save them enough money to warrant the switch, raising doubts about this new business model.""We have a lot of wait-and-see going on with large employers,"" said Brian Marcotte, chief executive officer of the National Business Group on Health, a lobbying group for large corporations. ""They are not quite sure yet how they will deliver on managing costs better.""U.S. employers provide health benefits for more than 160 million people, mostly by contracting with large health insurers to administer the healthcare benefits that the company funds, with contributions from employee-paid premiums. But as healthcare costs rose steadily, and President Barack Obama's healthcare law required coverage of more medical services, many sought ways to rein in those expenses.Private exchanges such as Aon Hewitt, part of Aon Plc, aim to be the Amazon.coms of the insurance world, where employees choose and pay for their own plans and competition helps keep prices down. Employers contribute a fixed dollar amount to help their workers buy coverage, but can save money by no longer managing the benefits within their companies. They are not directly related to the state-based Obamacare insurance exchanges that offer government-subsidized health plans. Since 2012, employers covering as many as 3 million people have signed on to use the exchanges, according to consulting firm Accenture. A recent report from Mercer LLC, part of Marsh & McLennan, found that 3 percent of large employers were using private exchanges and that 28 percent of employers would make the shift within five years, taking a bite out of the business served by major insurers like UnitedHealth Group Inc and Anthem Inc, previously known as WellPoint.      NEW SENSE OF CAUTION  Industry executives are now projecting more caution about when private exchanges will take off. Aon Hewitt said in October that it would lose money on its private exchange this year, after previously expecting the business to be mildly profitable. Aon did not say how much money it would lose. Insurer Cigna Corp will sell health plans on the Aon exchange in 2016. ""This is coming.

114,"   By Caroline Humer and Bill Berkrot  Aetna Inc, the third-largest U.S. health insurer, said it negotiated a discount with Gilead Sciences Inc for its hepatitis C treatment and will offer it as the preferred choice to nearly 11 million commercial customers.Aetna, which posted an updated coverage policy on its website on Friday, said it believes the price it received for Gilead's Sovaldi, and a newer combination treatment called Harvoni, is ""competitive with other recently announced agreements for this class of therapy."" It would not detail the size of the discount. Gilead shares closed up 3.4 percent at $100.71 after the Aetna deal was announced. Aetna shares closed 2.3 percent higher at $92.56.    Aetna and other insurers have pushed back against the high price of new hepatitis C treatments and other drugs, questioning their affordability after Gilead's Sovaldi was priced at $84,000 per treatment when it became the first new all-oral treatment to reach the market in late 2013. U.S. health regulators late last month approved Viekira Pak from AbbVie Inc, the first competitor to Gilead's drugs. Within a few days, Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager, dropped coverage of Gilead's treatments in most cases in favor of the AbbVie therapy, citing a substantial discount.  Both breakthrough treatments for the first time can cure the liver-wasting disease in more than 90 percent of patients without the miserable side effects of older medicines. More than 3 million people in the United States are estimated to have hepatitis C.Since Express Scripts' move, insurers have pressed both AbbVie and Gilead for discounts on their hepatitis C treatments to keep them on reimbursement lists. CVS Health, Anthem and Humana chose Gilead drugs as their preferred treatment, while pharmacy benefits company Prime Therapeutics kept both on its list.Wall Street analysts estimate the drugmakers have provided discounts of 30 percent or more. Gilead and AbbVie would not comment on the price reductions. Some industry experts see Gilead and AbbVie gaining in terms of the number of patients treated now that they have conceded on price. Many insurers had limited use of the new hepatitis C drugs to the sickest patients to contain costs.""The floodgates (of patients) could start to open over time this year,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. He has forecast $15 billion for Gilead worldwide hepatitis C sales in 2015 and sees room for upside.

115,"  (Adds portfolio manager, analyst comment, updates shares)By Caroline Humer and Bill BerkrotJan 16 Aetna Inc, the third-largest U.S. health insurer, said it negotiated a discount with Gilead Sciences Inc for its hepatitis C treatment and will offer it as the preferred choice to nearly 11 million commercial customers.Aetna, which posted an updated coverage policy on its website on Friday, said it believes the price it received for Gilead's Sovaldi, and a newer combination treatment called Harvoni, is ""competitive with other recently announced agreements for this class of therapy."" It would not detail the size of the discount.Gilead shares closed up 3.4 percent at $100.71 after the Aetna deal was announced. Aetna shares closed 2.3 percent higher at $92.56.Aetna and other insurers have pushed back against the high price of new hepatitis C treatments and other drugs, questioning their affordability after Gilead's Sovaldi was priced at $84,000 per treatment when it became the first new all-oral treatment to reach the market in late 2013. U.S. health regulators late last month approved Viekira Pak from AbbVie Inc, the first competitor to Gilead's drugs. Within a few days, Express Scripts, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager, dropped coverage of Gilead's treatments in most cases in favor of the AbbVie therapy, citing a substantial discount.Both breakthrough treatments for the first time can cure the liver-wasting disease in more than 90 percent of patients without the miserable side effects of older medicines. More than 3 million people in the United States are estimated to have hepatitis C. Since Express Scripts' move, insurers have pressed both AbbVie and Gilead for discounts on their hepatitis C treatments to keep them on reimbursement lists. CVS Health, Anthem  and Humana chose Gilead drugs as their preferred treatment, while pharmacy benefits company Prime Therapeutics kept both on its list.Wall Street analysts estimate the drugmakers have provided discounts of 30 percent or more. Gilead and AbbVie would not comment on the price reductions.Some industry experts see Gilead and AbbVie gaining in terms of the number of patients treated now that they have conceded on price. Many insurers had limited use of the new hepatitis C drugs to the sickest patients to contain costs. ""The floodgates (of patients) could start to open over time this year,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee. He has forecast $15 billion for Gilead worldwide hepatitis C sales in 2015 and sees room for upside.""That number starts to go up as we start seeing some of the prescription numbers come out,"" he said.Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the StockDoc Partners healthcare fund, expects $18 billion in Gilead hepatitis C sales this year as more patients are covered for treatment.Gilead's new two-drug treatment, Harvoni, taken as one pill once a day, is expected to replace Sovaldi use.

116,"  (Repeats story that originally ran on Thursday)By Deena Beasley and David MorganSAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON Jan 15 U.S. healthcare executives say Obamacare is likely here to stay, despite repeated calls from Republican lawmakers for repeal of the 2010 law aimed at providing health coverage for millions of uninsured Americans.Top executives who gathered in San Francisco this week for the annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference, say that while President Obama's signature domestic policy achievement may well be tweaked, it is too entrenched to be removed.The Obama administration said in November that it aims to have over 9 million people enrolled in government-backed federal and state health insurance marketplaces in 2015, their second year of operation. Another 10 million have enrolled for coverage under an expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor.Opponents of the law in the newly-elected Congress, now dominated by Republicans, seek to replace Obama's Affordable Care Act with their own healthcare reforms. Some are betting that the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down the federal tax subsidies helping the uninsured buy coverage in 36 states.For private health insurers and hospitals, the addition of millions of new covered patients has helped buoy their profits. Drugmakers have benefited from the increase in the number of patients eligible for reimbursement of prescription medications.Repeal of the Affordable Care Act ""is not a possibility,"" George Scangos, chief executive officer at biotechnology company Biogen Idec Inc, said in an interview. ""They would somehow have to explain to millions of people that they will lose health insurance."" Aetna Inc, the third biggest health insurer, said it is talking to Republicans and Democrats about a possible ""grand bargain"" to salvage Obamacare if the Supreme Court up-ends the healthcare law later this year.""Blowing up the (Affordable Care Act) is like shutting down the government,"" Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini told a small group of investors. ""So we are having conversations on both sides of the aisle about what ... things you change in the ACA, what we could introduce, about how to make a grand bargain should the Supreme Court decide."" TRANSITION PLAN The Supreme Court is due on March 4 to hear oral arguments in the case, with a ruling expected in June.""We're working on a proposal to lay out the transition, to make sure we can deal with this effectively and quickly,"" said Senator John Barrasso, chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee.""Putting aside the Supreme Court challenge, I don't see a veto-proof majority"" in Congress to overturn the law, said Merck & Co Inc Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier. ""I would expect changes in the structure of the law, not a wholesale repeal."" Some key changes Republicans are expected to target include Obamacare's employer mandate, which requires businesses with at least 50 full-time workers to offer health coverage to their employees or pay a penalty, according to congressional aides and lawmakers.Republican lawmakers also want to change the law's definition of ""full time"" as any employee who works 30 hours a week or more, provisions that compensate health insurers for market losses and an excise tax on medical devices, including the machines that produce CAT scans and magnetic resonance images.The strategy around replacing Obamacare was expected to be a topic this week during a meeting of Republican leadership in Pennsylvania, congressional aides said.Sylvia Burwell, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the law's implementation, said that Republican efforts to replace Obamacare are happening ""despite increasing evidence that the law is working.""A Gallup survey showed that the percentage of Americans without health insurance fell 4.2 percentage points to just under 13 percent at the end of 2014.""I don't think it will go away,"" said Jean-Jacques Bienaimé, Chief Executive Officer at BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. ""There will probably be some adjustments."" He said the ACA has helped companies like BioMarin that specialize in drugs for rare diseases because it prohibits lifetime caps on reimbursement, even for expensive medications.

Aetna said the increased outlook was also due to momentum in its business early in the year after a strong finish to 2014. It boosted its full-year operating earnings forecast to at least $7.00 per share, up from $6.90. Aetna also reported quarterly profit in line with estimates.The stock rose more than 1 percent.Aetna reported an improved medical benefit ratio of 83 percent for the fourth quarter, compared with 83.9 percent a year earlier. The ratio is the amount an insurer spends on medical claims compared with its income from premiums.The company said the costs of medical care have remained moderate and that it expects its medical benefit ratio to be between 82 percent and 83 percent. Its comments on spending were in line with larger competitors UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Anthem Inc (ANTM.N). The company said the medical benefit ratio for commercial plans, its largest business, deteriorated to 82 percent from 81.7 percent, due to higher-than-expected medical costs in small businesses and expenses associated with the new hepatitis C treatments.Last year Aetna was among insurance companies and other payers who said that the $84,000 cost per treatment for Gilead's new hepatitis C drug, which hit the market late in 2013, was unaffordable. When AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N) launched a competing drug at the end of 2014, insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and others started negotiating for discounts from Gilead. Aetna said last month it had secured a lower cost and would back Gilead's Harvoni drug as its preferred treatment over AbbVie's.Aetna's membership rose to 23.5 million at the end of 2014 from 22.2 million a year earlier, helped by growth in new insurance created by the national healthcare reform law, often called Obamacare. Aetna said it added 560,000 members from the Obamacare exchanges at the end of 2014 and expects that to increase to 800,000 by the end of the first quarter, helped by expansion into Georgia.The company reported operating earnings of $1.22 per share for the quarter, largely in line with average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

130,"   By Ransdell Pierson  CVS Health warned on Tuesday that the costs of a potent new class of cholesterol treatments could eclipse those of other expensive medicines and overwhelm the U.S. healthcare system ""if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place.""Two of the new injectable cholesterol treatments, called PCSK9 inhibitors, could gain U.S. approval this summer. CVS said they could eventually be used by as many as 15 million patients at an annual cost of up to $150 billion a year if priced at $7,000 to $12,000 a year, making it the highest-selling class of drugs in history.""The resilience and ability of our health care system to absorb such high costs will be tested if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place,"" William Shrank, chief scientific officer for CVS, said in a statement.CVS, the second-largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), negotiates drug prices for 65 million people through contracts with employers and health plans.The CVS call for cost controls follows sharp criticism from insurers, other payers and politicians over the high cost of new, highly effective treatments for hepatitis C, especially two medicines from Gilead Science Inc that have retail prices of up to $94,500 per patient for a course of treatment. Unlike those drugs, which are typically taken for about 12 weeks, the PCSK9s would be used for a lifetime.Express Scripts, the largest U.S. PBM, which has waged a campaign against Gilead's hepatitis C drugs and is now scrutinizing costly cancer medications, provided a slightly different view of the new cholesterol drug market.Express Scripts also expects annual costs of around $10,000 per year per patient. But it sees a patient population that will start small before it ever reaches a possible high of 10 million people and a potential annual cost of $100 billion. Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview that limits set by regulators and the fact that the first wave of drugs are injections may slow their uptake. ""We are going to work to get these products at the best price possible, but they also deserve to get value in the marketplace,"" Miller said.Amgen Inc and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc are awaiting approval of rival PCSK9 inhibitors.  They are expected to be used first by patients who are genetically prone to extreme high cholesterol - a population that CVS and Express peg at 620,000 Americans.

134,"  * BOJ's ETF buying supports mood - analysts     * Drugmakers outperform on strong U.S. healthcare shares     * Rakuten falls after Goldman cuts rating      By Ayai Tomisawa     TOKYO, March 5 Japan's Nikkei share average edged up on Thursday after the central bank bought more exchange-traded funds, but gains were limited by investor caution ahead of U.S. jobs data on Friday.     The Nikkei opened lower, but rose 0.2 percent to 18,742.97 by mid-morning, not far from its 15-year high of 18,939.17.     Analysts said investors were looking to U.S. job and wage data on Friday for further clues on when the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates.     But they also said that sentiment was supported by the central bank's move on Tuesday and Wednesday to purchase 35.2 billion yen ($293.90 million) of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) each day, the first time in three weeks.     ""People expect that the BOJ will support the market by buying ETFs when the market is weak in the morning,"" said Norihiro Fujito, a senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.     Healthcare stocks, which outperformed in the U.S. market on the previous day, lifted some Japanese drugmakers.     Ono Pharmaceutical Co, which co-develops cancer treatment drug Opdivo with Bristol Myers Squibb, jumped 8 percent after U.S. health regulators approved the drug for lung cancer.     The pharmaceutical sector gained 2.3 percent and was the second biggest gainer among 33 Topix's subsectors.     Other drugmakers also got a lift from strong performances in U.S. healthcare shares while retail investors are attracted to their high dividend yields, analysts said. The drugmakers' dividend yield stood at 1.99 percent, compared with the Nikkei's 1.38 percent.     Takeda Pharmaceutical Co gained 2.2 percent. Eisai Co jumped 5.4 percent after it and Merck announced a clinical trial collaboration to explore combination regimens of Anti-PD-1 therapy.      Exporters were mixed, with Toyota Motor Corp  falling 0.4 percent and Honda Motor Co gained 0.3 percent.     Bucking the trend, Rakuten Inc dropped 1.3 percent after Goldman Sachs cut its rating to 'neutral' from 'buy,' saying that positive factors such as margin improvement in the financial business were already priced into its shares.     The broader Topix rose 0.3 percent to 1,521.98 and the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 added 0.4 percent to 13,830.90.

The patient is the 11th person with the deadly virus treated in the United States.The NIH said the patient was in serious condition. The NIH did not release any more details. The aid group Partners In Health said in a statement that the clinician was working for them in Sierra Leone, and noted their colleague ""remains in good spirits.""The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said another American volunteering in Sierra Leone had ""potential exposure"" to that patient and was being transported to the Atlanta area to be near Emory University Hospital, which has treated other Ebola patients.The developments followed a relatively quiet period for Ebola in the United States, a reminder that while the spread of the virus has eased somewhat in West Africa, it still remains dangerous. The CDC said that as a result of the latest case it is working to trace the contacts of volunteers combating Ebola in Sierra Leone, including several other Americans, who may have been exposed to the healthcare worker now at the NIH.The CDC said none of these other people, including the one headed to Atlanta, has tested positive. However, the CDC said it was working with the State Department to develop plans to return those Americans with potential exposure to the United State, where they will isolate themselves and be under direct CDC monitoring 21 days.A British healthcare worker who tested positive for Ebola while in Sierra Leone was flown back this week to Britain, along with four others who are being monitored for possible infection.CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said the agency's team in Sierra Leone is still gathering information but said there is no evidence so far that the U.S. and British cases are related.While the virus has killed about 10,000 people in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, only a handful of cases have been seen in the United States, Spain and Britain.

143,"   By Dan Butcher  Brokerages are rolling out software to help financial advisers with a challenge that can seem like fortune-telling: projecting clients' retirement health care costs.Rising healthcare expenses can eat away at retirement savings. Future total healthcare costs for a 65-year-old couple retiring this year will average $394,000 in today's dollars, according to a report this week by HealthView services, a retirement healthcare data company in Danvers, Massachusetts. But a couple that retires in 2025 at age 65 will need $464,000 to fund those same expenses, which include various Medicare premiums, copays and dental visits. The bills only rise as couples live beyond average life expectancies, according to HealthView.Financial advisory firms are beefing up their software to tailor projections of clients' retirement healthcare costs. The figures can drive home reality, especially as the tools become more sophisticated, advisers say.The jolt is much-needed. Many Americans age 50 or more do not include healthcare costs in their retirement planning, even though the price tag is their greatest concern, according to a 2014 Merrill Lynch survey.Raymond James added a new healthcare calculator to its financial planning software last year based, in part, on concepts developed by the MIT AgeLab, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) research program that encourages the development of new technologies to support human longevity. The calculator helps stimulate retirement planning discussions at Briggs Wealth Management in Clearwater, Florida, a Raymond James-affiliated firm. Advisers Kimberly and Dennis Briggs use it to estimate everything from future Medicare premiums to long-term care insurance premiums, she said.The tool, part of a broader financial planning analysis, relies on clients’ answers to questions about family histories, chronic illnesses, and other factors. Clients then review several future healthcare scenarios, which can be one based on their current strategy, and two others with and without long-term care insurance. The analysis, for example, showed one couple whose families had a history of medical problems that buying long-term care insurance could boost the probability of reaching their retirement goals from 40 percent to 76 percent. Achieving those goals can depend on curbing current expenses to save more, Kimberly Briggs said. Putting a number on future healthcare expenses can motivate clients to scale back vacations or buy a smaller house, she said.Merrill Lynch launched financial planning software last year that uses interactive graphics and charts to help clients understand future healthcare costs. Clients remember information more easily that way than after a long conversation, said Susan Acker, a Merrill Lynch adviser in Rochester New York. They interact with the program on Acker’s iPad by tapping on icons to see research and charts about their future costs.Small firms are finding healthcare-focused tools in off-the-shelf programs such as MoneyGuidePro, a financial planning program by PIEtech Inc in Powhatan, Virginia.

Healthy retirees, for example, typically spend more on healthcare than those with medical problems, such as diabetes, according to HealthView, the data provider.

The insurers say that the tests are unproven and may lead patients to seek out medical care they don't need.That's a dangerous miscalculation, a range of doctors, genetic counselors, academics and diagnostics companies said. While they acknowledge that multi-gene tests produce data that may not be useful from a diagnostic standpoint, they say that by refusing or delaying coverage, insurance companies are endangering patients who could be undergoing screenings or changing their diets if they knew about the possible risks.The tests have come a long way since Jolie, 39, went public in 2013, revealing that she underwent a double mastectomy after a genetic test found she carried mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, indicating a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer. She disclosed last month that she had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.The new panel tests, which can cost between $2,000 to $4,900, analyze 20 or more genes at once.

The biggest U.S. banks are under pressure from regulators to preserve more capital, rather than use M&A fees to pay higher bonuses.""The volume of transactions across healthcare is extreme and so the banker merry-go-round begins,"" said Paul Heller, the leader of executive recruiting firm Caldwell Partners' financial services practice.There's been $92.5 billion worth of U.S. healthcare merger activity so far this year, 73 percent more than in the same period last year, driven by 242 deals. Healthcare has been the busiest sector for deals so far this year, fueled by transactions such as Pfizer Inc's $17 billion offer for Hospira Inc and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Ltd's $11 billion acquisition of Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd.U.S. healthcare investment banking fees, meanwhile, have topped $1.9 billion since January, up more than 37 percent from the same period last year.Average annual pay for a healthcare investment banking managing director - the most typical role for a senior banker -- is roughly $1.5 million to $2 million, according to recruiters and bankers, and hasn't budged much in recent years despite the rise in M&A activity. Wall Street compensation rose about 4 percent on average last year, according to financial industry recruiting firm Options Group. Some large banks are hoping to stem the flow of banker departures by offering one-year pay guarantees for top performers, according to industry bankers.Guggenheim Partners said in March that Joseph Kohls, a former Bank of America Corp global healthcare co-head and Jeffrey Hoffman, JPMorgan Chase & Co's former West Coast healthcare head, would be joining the firm.Kohls helped advise medical device company Biomet Inc on its $13.4 billion acquisition by Zimmer Holdings Inc last year, and Hoffman led a team that advised AbbVie Inc on its $55 billion deal for British pharmaceutical company Shire, which it ended up abandoning.Bankers can often negotiate a 30 to 50 percent pay raise for their first-year compensation at a new bank if they jump ship, according to recruiters and bankers. Free from many of Wall Street's regulations, a boutique investment bank can also offer bankers hefty commissions on individual deals. Some boutique banks are luring rainmakers with the promise of taking home a large percentage of the fees they generate, bankers and recruiters said, a practice rarely seen at the bigger banks.Boutiques can also offer their bankers compensation in cash, while a large portion of pay at larger banks remains tied up in stock.Neither Kohls nor Hoffman responded to requests for comment. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Lorence Kim left in March 2014 to take a job with life science company Moderna, while his Goldman colleague David Woodhouse joined NGM Biopharmaceuticals in March of this year. Morgan Stanley's  Steve Harr took an executive position at Juno Therapeutics in March 2014.Former Credit Suisse investment banker Mark Page joined biotech Macrocure Ltd in February as chief financial officer.""My whole banking career was to help set me up for an opportunity like this,"" Page said.Kim, Woodhouse and Harr all declined to respond to requests for comment.These bankers may benefit by taking executive roles at biotech companies and receiving stock as part of their compensation, in a bet that the share price will go up. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index has risen 66 percent in the last 12 months.""The potential equity upside on the corporate side is as attractive today than it ever has been compared to Wall Street compensation,"" said Burke St. John, vice chairman and head of the global financial services practice at executive search firm CTPartners. ""It might take you two or three times as long on a more traditional Wall Street career path to earn what you could make working for the right client.""

153,"  NEW YORK, April 28 Aetna Inc CEO Mark Bertolini said on Tuesday that it added more new customers than expected through the individual Obamacare exchanges, and that their average age was a bit lower this year than in 2014. Bertolini told investors during a conference call that other Obamacare customer demographics - which along with age is considered an indicator of how much the company may have to spend on medical claims - looked about the same as 2014.

157,"   By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON May 13 A newly created non-profit organization sued the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday in an effort to force the agency to adopt rules requiring companies to disclose political contributions.The Campaign for Accountability said it was formed to use ""research, litigation and communications to expose misconduct and malfeasance in public life.""The SEC has been under mounting pressure from liberal groups, as well as a handful of law professors, to enact rules requiring companies to tell investors about campaign contributions.The efforts were sparked by the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, which loosened campaign finance rules and opened the floodgates to millions of dollars in political spending by businesses and individuals.The decision inspired a new wave of politically focused non-profit groups that are not required to disclose the identity of their donors. SEC Chair Mary Jo White has said the agency is not going to write rules on corporate spending, and instead would focus on completing regulations required by Congress in 2010 and 2012.The lawsuit marks the latest effort to force the SEC into action.Last year, another group called the Corporate Reform Coalition held a news conference outside SEC headquarters to make similar demands. Earlier this year, members of the coalition also launched a public relations blitz titled ""Have you seen Mary Jo White?""The campaign features posters that depict White as a comic book style super hero rushing to rescue investors in the dark about how corporations spend money on political issues.The posters were placed in Union Station, the metro stop next door to the SEC's headquarters. The Campaign for Accountability said its lawsuit against the SEC was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of Steve Silberstein, who filed a rule-making petition to the SEC last year.The group says the agency ""ignored"" his request and violated federal laws that govern the rule-making process.In 2013, Silberstein sued Aetna Inc as a shareholder, saying it failed to accurately reveal its political donations.The case was later dismissed.An SEC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.

164,"  NEW YORK Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for elderly and disabled Americans, paid physicians $90 billion in 2013, up 17 percent from $77 billion in 2012, U.S. healthcare officials reported on Monday. Physician payments accounted for less than one-fifth of Medicare's 2013 net outlays of $492 billion, which rose from $466 billion in 2012. Payments to hospitals for the top 100 inpatient stays cost Medicare $62 billion in 2013, while the rest went for drugs, privately run Medicare Advantage plans and other program costs.The payments went to about 950,000 doctors, nurse practitioners and other individual healthcare providers who participate in the program. That was up from 880,000 providers in 2012.The hospital data offer a glimpse of what ails America's elderly - and the quality shortfalls in U.S. healthcare.The single-greatest hospital expense was to replace knees, hips and other joints in 446,148 operations, with $6.6 billion paid to hospitals. The second-greatest hospital payment, $5.6 billion, went for 398,004 cases of septicemia, or blood poisoning, often a sign of poor in-patient care.In a significant change from the data released last year, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services differentiated between what it paid physicians for their services and what it paid to cover the costs of drugs they administered. Some physicians had complained that they were portrayed as exorbitant billers because the cost of drugs was included in what Medicare paid them. Among physicians, the highest-paid specialists were radiation oncologists, who received an average of $403,512 from Medicare for their services. That was closely followed by dermatologists ($331,108), vascular surgeons ($329,874), and ophthalmologists ($326,621).In contrast, medical oncologists, who treat cancer patients with chemotherapy and generally coordinate their care, received an average of $181,747. The previous year's data portrayed them as some of the top Medicare billers, but that largely reflected reimbursements for the cost of drugs - an average $473,926 in 2013. The data showed that patients who lament how little time they get with their physicians are not imagining it. Dermatologists billed for the most office visits lasting only five or 10 minutes (nearly 30 percent of total visits), whereas oncologists had almost no visits that short.Medicare patients averaged six physician visits in 2013, but that varied significantly by state. Patients in New York, New Jersey, Florida, and Tennessee saw their doctors nearly seven times that year; those in northern New England, the Dakotas, Idaho, Montana, and New Mexico averaged fewer than four visits.

166,"  (Adds email from GE chief executive, statement from Aetna)By Edward KrudyNEW YORK, June 4 General Electric Co has assembled an ""exploratory team"" to look at moving its headquarters out of Connecticut after lawmakers passed a budget that includes $1.2 billion in tax increases despite protests from some of the state's biggest corporations.In an email sent on Thursday to GE's Connecticut employees and obtained by Reuters, Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said he had asked the team to examine the company's options to relocate the headquarters to a state with a ""more pro-business environment."" GE has 5,700 employees in Connecticut.Lawmakers passed a $40 billion biannual budget late on Wednesday. GE, Aetna Inc and Travelers Cos Inc  as well as the state's Republicans slammed the measures, which extend a 20 percent surcharge on corporate tax and introduce a tax on group-wide income even if it originates out of state.GE and Aetna, which also has a corporate headquarters in the state, said on Monday they would consider leaving Connecticut, but Immelt's email is the first sign a major corporation is taking concrete steps that could lead to it quitting the state. The loss of GE would be a huge blow to Connecticut, which bled thousands of jobs after the financial crisis and has been one of the slowest states to recover from the recession.The state's economy grew just 0.9 percent in 2013, compared with 2.2 percent for the United States as a whole, while job growth has also lagged.""If this budget would wind up driving employers out of state, it would be even harder to fund the services that this budget is intended to fund,"" said Jared Walczak at the Washington-based Tax Foundation. Walczak said the budget would increase business taxes by around $500 million over two years.Democratic Governor Dannel Malloy had trumpeted the budget as an ""historic investment"" in roads, bridges, rail and other infrastructure slated to reach $10 billion over five years.Facing the growing backlash on Thursday, a spokesman for his office said: ""We have spoken with GE in recent days and have been kept apprised of their thinking."" Separately, Aetna issued another statement on Thursday saying its annual $65 million state tax bill would jump 27 percent once all the budget measures were implemented.""Elected leaders have failed to address the state's budget obligation responsibly,"" Aetna said. ""But it's Connecticut's businesses and residents that will pay the price.""The state also increased a tax on data processing that Aetna said would ""hurt our ability to remain competitive and invest in our employees and customers.""The extension of the temporary 20 percent surcharge maintains Connecticut's effective corporate tax rate at 9 percent, compared with a base rate of 7.5 percent, the fifth-highest in the nation, according to the Tax Foundation.The budget also raises the top rate of income tax to 6.99 percent from 6.7 percent, cuts property tax credits and boosts the sales tax on luxury items to 7.75 percent from 7 percent. That includes automobiles over $50,000, jewelry over $5,000, and clothing and accessories over $1,000.

""Even as we have one of the lowest effective corporate tax rates in the nation, these steps are being made to protect Connecticut's long-term interests,"" Malloy said in a statement.Connecticut's lawmakers will meet this month in a special session to implement the budget plan.

170,"  * Supreme Court to decide fate of U.S. healthcare* Ruling expected this month, as early as MondayBy Joan BiskupicWASHINGTON, June 14 Justice Anthony Kennedy was furious when a majority on the U.S. Supreme Court upheld President Barack Obama's healthcare law. As he read the dissenting opinion from the bench three years ago, his anger was palpable. The majority regards its opinion ""as judicial modesty,"" he declared. ""It is not. It amounts instead to a vast judicial over-reaching.""That was Kennedy on June 28, 2012.Now, as the country awaits a ruling in the second major challenge to Obama's signature Affordable Care Act, a question is whether the justice who was the voice of the opposition then could provide the critical fifth vote to uphold the law on the nine-justice court now.At stake are the tax-credit subsidies that have helped low- and moderate-income Americans obtain health insurance. The challengers say the government unlawfully extended those subsidies to states that did not create local insurance exchanges but instead relied on the federal exchange. If the court strikes down the subsidies, millions of Americans in at least 34 of the 50 states could lose coverage.Five years after its passage, the Affordable Care Act has become ingrained in American life even as it remains politically divisive. ""This is now part of the fabric of how we care for one another,"" Obama, a Democrat, declared in a speech last week. Republicans have called for repeal and among the related lawsuits simmering in lower courts is a dispute brought by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives over Treasury Department payments to healthcare insurers. IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT In the case before the court, the unique issue along with Kennedy's record and his comments in oral arguments raise the possibility he will join the four liberal justices to endorse the law. Three years ago, his fellow conservative Chief Justice John Roberts cast the swing vote with the liberals to uphold the law. It marked a rare episode when Kennedy, the usual key justice on this divided bench, did not control the outcome of a momentous case.It is impossible to predict with confidence how the court will resolve the case, King v. Burwell. A ruling is anxiously awaited by officials in Washington and the insurance and healthcare industries nationwide. What is known: Two days after the March 4 oral arguments this year, the justices, per their usual practice, took a vote in a small conference room off Chief Justice Roberts' chambers. The most senior justice on the winning side then assigned the opinion for those in the majority; the senior justice on the dissenting side tapped a writer for the main dissent. Drafts of dueling opinions began circulating among the chambers.In this conversation through memos, the justices will sharpen their arguments, sometimes compromising in reasoning and rhetoric to keep a majority together. Those in dissent similarly hone their retorts. The process is shrouded in secrecy, and the public will only know who is writing which opinion when they are issued.For King v. Burwell, the decision could come down as soon as Monday morning, when the justices next take the bench. It is more likely to be issued later this month. The toughest disputes tend to be resolved right up against the traditional end-of-June deadline for the court's nine-month session. Among the 20 awaited cases is also the question of whether the U.S. Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage. A PIVOTAL POSITION On healthcare, either Kennedy or Roberts could tip the balance. Yet the 78-year-old Kennedy, appointed to the bench in 1988 by Republican President Ronald Reagan, may be in a more pivotal position based on his respect for state sovereignty and concern for the practical consequences of a decision.While the 2012 dispute posed a broad-ranging constitutional challenge to the individual insurance mandate before it even took effect, this one turns on a mere four-word clause allowing tax credits for insurance purchased through exchanges ""established by the state.""The challengers, libertarian lawyers who were among those who lodged the 2012 attack, say that means that the subsidies are not available to people who have bought insurance through federally facilitated exchanges, which vastly outnumber state-run exchanges. The Obama administration contends the law, taken as a whole, makes clear that Congress, when it passed the law, intended the subsidies to apply to all exchanges.During oral arguments Justice Kennedy suggested the challengers' view of the law could put unconstitutional federal pressure on states, because if they failed to set up exchanges, they would lose subsidies: ""The states are being told either create your own exchange or we'll send your insurance market into a death spiral,"" he said.Kennedy also does not rigidly interpret the words of a statute.

171,"  * Anthem offered $175/share for Cigna - WSJ* UnitedHealth also eyeing Cigna and Aetna - WSJ* Cigna shares touch record high of $162.16   (Adds Breakingviews link)June 15 Health insurer Cigna Corp  rebuffed a takeover offer from larger rival Anthem Inc, as the U.S. managed care sector gears up for a round of consolidation, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.Cigna and Anthem have been in discussions for months, with Anthem making two takeover bids within the last 10 days, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. (on.wsj.com/1JTBQP0)Anthem's last bid was worth about $175 per Cigna share, the Journal said, valuing the company at about $45 billion according to Thomson Reuters calculations.Cigna had a market capitalization of $35.34 billion as of Friday's close. U.S. health insurers have come under pressure as the government and employers toughen their stance on spending for medical procedures and drugs. In such a scenario, growing through acquisitions makes sense and could even grant insurers leverage in negotiating prices with hospitals.Cigna's rejection of Anthem's takeover offer is the latest in a series of moves involving potential deals in the sector.UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, is also eyeing Cigna and Aetna, the Journal said on Monday, citing sources. Separately, Bloomberg reported that Anthem was also weighing up a bid for Humana. (bloom.bg/1FjemfT)The news comes less than a month after Humana Inc  said it was exploring a sale, with Aetna Inc and Cigna said to be among those interested.The Anthem talks for Cigna show that the next deal in the industry will not necessarily be a sale of Humana, as many industry watchers expected, the Journal said. Cigna shares jumped 18 percent to a record high of $162.16, while Anthem's stock closed up 2.3 percent at $164.46.Humana's shares closed down 2.7 percent at $206.58.Spokespersons for Anthem, Aetna, Cigna and UnitedHealth said the companies did not comment on rumors or market speculation. Humana could not immediately be reached for comment.Cigna manages insurance plans for large companies and sells health plans on government exchanges created under the U.S. Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare. It also offers dental and other benefits.Anthem is one of the biggest players on the individual exchanges created under Obamacare and also runs a huge employer-based insurance business.(Reporting by Amrutha Penumudi in Bengaluru; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Simon Jennings)",2015-06-15,AET,"Mon Jun 15, 2015 | 4:50pm EDT",UPDATE 4-Cigna rebuffs takeover approach by Anthem - WSJ,http://www.reuters.com//article/cigna-ma-anthem-idUSL3N0Z14Z020150615?type=companyNews
172,"  (Repeating without changes for wider distribution)* Supreme Court to decide fate of U.S. healthcare* Ruling expected this month, as early as MondayBy Joan BiskupicWASHINGTON, June 14 Justice Anthony Kennedy was furious when a majority on the U.S. Supreme Court upheld President Barack Obama's healthcare law. As he read the dissenting opinion from the bench three years ago, his anger was palpable. The majority regards its opinion ""as judicial modesty,"" he declared. ""It is not. It amounts instead to a vast judicial over-reaching.""That was Kennedy on June 28, 2012.Now, as the country awaits a ruling in the second major challenge to Obama's signature Affordable Care Act, a question is whether the justice who was the voice of the opposition then could provide the critical fifth vote to uphold the law on the nine-justice court now.At stake are the tax-credit subsidies that have helped low- and moderate-income Americans obtain health insurance. The challengers say the government unlawfully extended those subsidies to states that did not create local insurance exchanges but instead relied on the federal exchange. If the court strikes down the subsidies, millions of Americans in at least 34 of the 50 states could lose coverage.Five years after its passage, the Affordable Care Act has become ingrained in American life even as it remains politically divisive. ""This is now part of the fabric of how we care for one another,"" Obama, a Democrat, declared in a speech last week. Republicans have called for repeal and among the related lawsuits simmering in lower courts is a dispute brought by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives over Treasury Department payments to healthcare insurers. IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT In the case before the court, the unique issue along with Kennedy's record and his comments in oral arguments raise the possibility he will join the four liberal justices to endorse the law. Three years ago, his fellow conservative Chief Justice John Roberts cast the swing vote with the liberals to uphold the law. It marked a rare episode when Kennedy, the usual key justice on this divided bench, did not control the outcome of a momentous case.It is impossible to predict with confidence how the court will resolve the case, King v. Burwell. A ruling is anxiously awaited by officials in Washington and the insurance and healthcare industries nationwide. What is known: Two days after the March 4 oral arguments this year, the justices, per their usual practice, took a vote in a small conference room off Chief Justice Roberts' chambers. The most senior justice on the winning side then assigned the opinion for those in the majority; the senior justice on the dissenting side tapped a writer for the main dissent. Drafts of dueling opinions began circulating among the chambers.In this conversation through memos, the justices will sharpen their arguments, sometimes compromising in reasoning and rhetoric to keep a majority together. Those in dissent similarly hone their retorts. The process is shrouded in secrecy, and the public will only know who is writing which opinion when they are issued.For King v. Burwell, the decision could come down as soon as Monday morning, when the justices next take the bench. It is more likely to be issued later this month. The toughest disputes tend to be resolved right up against the traditional end-of-June deadline for the court's nine-month session. Among the 20 awaited cases is also the question of whether the U.S. Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage. A PIVOTAL POSITION On healthcare, either Kennedy or Roberts could tip the balance. Yet the 78-year-old Kennedy, appointed to the bench in 1988 by Republican President Ronald Reagan, may be in a more pivotal position based on his respect for state sovereignty and concern for the practical consequences of a decision.While the 2012 dispute posed a broad-ranging constitutional challenge to the individual insurance mandate before it even took effect, this one turns on a mere four-word clause allowing tax credits for insurance purchased through exchanges ""established by the state.""The challengers, libertarian lawyers who were among those who lodged the 2012 attack, say that means that the subsidies are not available to people who have bought insurance through federally facilitated exchanges, which vastly outnumber state-run exchanges. The Obama administration contends the law, taken as a whole, makes clear that Congress, when it passed the law, intended the subsidies to apply to all exchanges.During oral arguments Justice Kennedy suggested the challengers' view of the law could put unconstitutional federal pressure on states, because if they failed to set up exchanges, they would lose subsidies: ""The states are being told either create your own exchange or we'll send your insurance market into a death spiral,"" he said.Kennedy also does not rigidly interpret the words of a statute. He considers how a decision may play out, and he noted that if ""people pay mandated taxes"" and are denied tax credits, ""the cost of insurance will be sky-high.""Still, Kennedy may harbor skepticism about the law known as Obamacare, and he acknowledged during arguments the possibility that the challengers could ""prevail on the plain words of the statute.""

179,"  * Healthcare stocks lead Wall St up on Supreme Court ruling* Iran talks drag crude prices lower   (Updates trading, adds U.S. markets, changes byline, dateline, previous LONDON)By Rodrigo CamposNEW YORK, June 25 A Supreme Court ruling upholding tax subsidies boosted some U.S. healthcare stocks to fresh highs on Thursday, while key global equity markets were little changed following a proposal by Greece's creditors to avoid a Greek debt default.Oil prices fell on concerns over the possible impact of Greece's debt crisis on European energy demand and the prospect of Iranian oil adding to a global glut if sanctions are lifted.Greece's international creditors presented a cash-for-reform proposal to euro zone finance ministers in a showdown with Athens, after negotiations failed to yield a plan to avert a default.""There is still a bit of optimism left that a deal can be done ... A failure to reach a deal is certainly not priced into the market just yet,"" Peregrine & Black senior analyst Markus Huber said.Market participants had assumed this week that a deal would eventually be reached after European officials said on Monday and Tuesday a proposal from Greece was a good basis for talks.The differences between Greece's proposal and that of its creditors aren't big enough to justify failing to reach an agreement, a senior Greek government official said. On Wall Street, hospital and other healthcare shares surged, with several hitting all-time peaks, after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld tax subsidies that are key to President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law.""The hospital stocks all reacted positively to the news, which isn't a surprise. While any change in policy would've been a surprise, affirming the status quo removes a lot of uncertainty from the sector,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 25.12 points, or 0.14 percent, to 17,991.19, the S&P 500 gained 4.76 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,113.34 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 13.96 points, or 0.27 percent, to 5,136.37.The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index was down 0.2 percent. An MSCI gauge of major global markets added less than 0.1 percent. OIL SLIDES In commodities markets, crude prices fell, with traders eyeing progress toward a June 30 deadline for an Iran nuclear accord that would be key to lifting Western sanctions on Tehran's oil exports.""Even if it does take Iran a year or more to return output and exports to pre-sanctions levels, the anticipation of this additional supply should still affect prices now,"" Capital Economics said.""The prospect of another 1 million bpd increase in supply from Iran ... could easily drag (Brent) prices below $60 again."" Brent fell 0.7 percent to $62.99 a barrel and U.S. crude was down 1 percent at $59.68 a barrel.Spot gold edged lower, down for a fifth straight session, while copper prices rose 0.3 percent.EURO HOLDS The euro was little changed against the U.S. dollar, even after data showed U.S. consumer spending recorded its largest increase in nearly six years on strong demand for automobiles and other big-ticket items.The euro was down 0.07 percent at $1.1197.""Watching Greek headlines. That's kind of holding markets back,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, currency strategist at BNP Paribas in New York.""This week we have seen appetite to start rebuilding dollar long positions,"" he said.

181,"  (Adds no comment from Cigna, regulators involved in deal, paragraphs 2, 8)By Luciana LopezNEW YORK, July 3 Aetna Inc's $37 billion deal to buy smaller health insurer Humana Inc will face rigorous scrutiny from U.S. regulators, which antitrust experts said could also make other large-scale mergers in the sector more difficult.The Aetna-Humana tie-up would be the largest such deal among health insurers.

184,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) on Friday said it would buy smaller rival Humana Inc (HUM.N) for about $37 billion in cash and stock, in the largest ever deal in the insurance industry.The combination will push Aetna close to Anthem Inc's (ANTM.N) No.2 insurer spot by membership, and would nearly triple Aetna's Medicare Advantage business.The deal will face antitrust scrutiny but if it goes through it would dwarf the previous largest insurance deal announced just this week, where Swiss property and casualty giant ACE Ltd (ACE.N) announced it was buying Chubb Corp (CB.N) for $28 billion. It would also dwarf Anthem Inc's purchase of WellPoint in 2004 for $16.6 billion.Analysts have said that M&A activity in the healthcare sector had been waiting for last week's Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare, which upheld key subsidies that underpin the reform and thus gave more certainty to healthcare insurers.The bigger the insurer, the more power it has negotiating prices and improving its doctor networks.Anthem has offered to buy Cigna Corp (CI.N) to create the largest insurer in the country, toppling UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N).Media reports have also said UnitedHealth could be eyeing Cigna and Aetna. On Thursday, Centene Corp (CNC.N) said it would buy smaller rival Health Net Inc HNT.N for $6.3 billion.ANTITRUST ISSUES Antitrust authorities, who were aggressive in their review of the failed deal between Comcast (CMCSA.O) and Time Warner Cable TWC.N, are expected to scrutinize how the combination of insurers will affect competition for each line of insurance: Medicare, Medicaid for the poor, individual insurance, commercial insurance for small and large businesses and the large employer business. Aetna and Humana are in nine of the same states in Medicare Advantage. Combined, they would have market share of 88 percent in Kansas, 80 percent in West Virginia, 58 percent in Iowa and 51 percent in Missouri.    Wall Street analysts and some antitrust experts have said  they expect the combination will be approved, although regulators may ask for some divestitures. Others have said it is unclear that this group of regulators will stick to the usual review playbook for such a large deal and may add other restrictions. The Justice Department, which reviews insurance mergers, will scrutinize deals city-by-city to see if the combination would have a monopoly in any metropolitan area, said Andre Barlow, a veteran of the department who is now at Washington law firm Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC.Aetna said the combined company is projected to have over 33 million medical members, based on memberships as of March 31. Operating revenue is expected to be about $115 billion this year, with approximately 56 percent from government-sponsored programs including Medicare and Medicaid.Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld subsidies for individuals under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law, keeping a large chunk of patients intact under the Medicare and Medicaid programs.Insurers have said subsidies are key to bringing in new customers and the ruling has removed uncertainty for insurers looking for acquisitions. It could also spur more deal making in the health insurance sector, which has already seen a blitz of merger activity this year. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, praised Humana's presence in his home state but also noted the role of the healthcare law in the merger.""This morning's announcement, as I predicted during the debate five years ago, is the inevitable result of Obamacare’s push toward consolidation as doctors, hospitals, and insurers merge in response to an ever-growing government,"" the Republican said in a statement.The deal includes a $1 billion break-up fee payable by Aetna to Humana, should the deal fail because of antitrust concerns, an Aetna spokeswoman confirmed. The fee was first reported by the Wall Street Journal. CASH AND SHARES Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna said it would pay Humana shareholders $125 in cash and 0.8375 Aetna shares for each share held. The offer of about $230 per share is a 23 percent premium to Humana's closing price on Thursday.Following the deal, Aetna shareholders would own about 74 percent of the combined company with Humana shareholders owning the rest. Aetna Chief Executive Mark Bertolini will serve as chairman and CEO of the combined company. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2016 and add to operating earnings per share from 2017.Humana's sale has been anticipated since May when it was first reported that Cigna Corp (CI.N) and Aetna were interested, and multiple sources confirmed to Reuters that the company was entertaining offers. Humana, based in Louisville, Kentucky, has been under pressure for more than a year from investors, which include activist fund Glenview Capital Management, to produce higher returns.   Last year Humana hired a CFO from investment bank Goldman Sachs and went through a strategic review that included asset sales. But it missed several quarters of earnings targets and struggled with profits in its individual business, disappointing Wall Street.Aetna said it has received commitments from Citi and UBS Investment Bank to finance the deal.Citi and Lazard are financial advisers for Aetna and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP is its legal adviser. Goldman Sachs is the financial adviser to Humana, while Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson LLP is its legal adviser.

191,"  (Adds comments from Massachusetts attorney general, American Hospital Association)By Caroline HumerNEW YORK, July 6 Aetna Inc's chief executive said Monday he was confident any antitrust review of the health insurer's proposed purchase of smaller rival Humana Inc would allow the deal to close in the second half of 2016.Mark Bertolini said Aetna had already prepared for possible divestitures to address overlaps with Humana's business in the largest-ever U.S. health insurance deal. The two sides announced the $37 billion transaction on Friday. Hospital and state officials said they would take a hard look at whether the deal would diminish competition for consumers.""We took a conservative view of what we would need to divest,"" Bertolini said during an investor conference call.Aetna has not discussed the deal directly with the U.S. Department of Justice, but has consulted with regulatory experts, Bertolini told cable channel CNBC.""We believe that given the legal advice we have...that this is a very manageable transaction,"" he said. The bigger the insurer, the more power it has negotiating prices with hospitals and other providers, as well as improving its doctor networks.Aetna and Humana are in nine of the same states in one of their key businesses - Medicare Advantage plans for the elderly. Combined, they would have market share of 88 percent in Kansas, 80 percent in West Virginia, 58 percent in Iowa and 51 percent in Missouri.Regulators would also look for the impact on competition in each local market for the companies' Medicaid plans for the poor, individual insurance, commercial insurance for small and large businesses and the large employer business.Attorneys general in several U.S. states said on Monday they would be ready to review the proposed deal. ""Our office is aware of these mergers, and we will be looking to determine whether or not there's any significant impact on Massachusetts,"" said Chloe Gotsis, a spokeswoman for the state AG's office.Healthcare providers are concerned that further consolidation will decrease competition in the insurance industry, said Alicia Mitchell, spokeswoman for the American Hospital Association.""Any potential deal of this magnitude needs rigorous scrutiny. That's why the AHA will call upon the DOJ and Congress to exercise a significant level of scrutiny,"" Mitchell said in an emailed statement. Health insurers have been in a race to consolidate, saying that being larger would help them negotiate better prices with doctors and hospitals as well as cut administrative costs.No. 2 health insurer Anthem Inc has offered to buy No. 5 Cigna Corp. The two companies have revived discussions in light of the Humana-Aetna deal, though it is not clear whether they can agree on terms including price and governance issues, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.If an Anthem-Cigna deal is announced within the next two to three months, regulators could look at the impact of both mergers at the same time, Bertolini said.""It really depends on whether or not any other deals are announced,"" he told investors. ""Currently we anticipate that our transaction will be viewed alone at this point in time, but they could be bundled together at some point.""Aetna shares fell 6.4 percent to $117.43 on Monday as investors took stock of the regulatory and financial risks of the deal.

Humana CEO Bruce Broussard said on a conference call with investors that inpatient hospital admissions have not performed in line with what the company had forecast.

It was unclear how much it would differ from other proposals rejected in the past.Equity futures tumbled at the open late on Sunday after Greeks voted 'No' to the terms imposed by its creditors. However the S&P 500 didn't fall more than 1 percent throughout the Monday session and even turned positive in morning trading.Though Greece is causing a lot of uncertainty, a deal should get done to keep them in the Euro Zone, according to Karyn Cavanaugh, market strategist at Voya Investment Management in New York. ""Greece can't pay their bills, there's no middle ground there and other countries are going to have to foot the bill and they are angry,"" she said.But more than billions in debt are in play as ""Greece is the southern gateway to Europe. The strategic value is not being quantified.""The Dow Jones industrial average fell 46.53 points, or 0.26 percent, to 17,683.58, the S&P 500 lost 8.02 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,068.76 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 17.27 points, or 0.34 percent, to 4,991.94.Weighing further on investor sentiment, Chinese brokerages and fund managers vowed to buy massive amounts of stocks as Beijing unleashed an unprecedented series of support measures to stem a decline of nearly 30 percent in the main Shanghai index over the past three weeks. ""People see 'emergency measures' and they think 'that can't be good',"" said Voya's Cavanaugh.The Shanghai index rose 2.4 percent overnight but a measure of Chinese stocks traded in the United States  fell the most in 19 months, pointing to caution from investors outside of China about the effectiveness of the government's measures.Energy stocks led the decline on Wall Street after U.S. crude futures prices settled almost 8 percent lower on concern over growth in China and the Greek uncertainty.The S&P 500 energy index fell 1.3 percent, marking its fourth decline of more than 1 percent in the past seven sessions. Health insurer Aetna fell 6.4 percent to $117.43 after it said it would buy smaller rival Humana for about $37 billion. Humana closed up 0.8 percent to $188.96.The deal is seen facing antitrust scrutiny, which could make other large-scale mergers in the sector more difficult. Anthem , Cigna, Centene and Health Net, which are all in takeover talks, ended lower.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by 1,946 to 1,132, for a 1.72-to-1 ratio on the downside; on the Nasdaq, 1,600 issues fell and 1,181 advanced for a 1.35-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 5 new 52-week highs and 32 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 44 new highs and 130 new lows.About 6.6 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the average of 7.6 billion in the past five sessions.(Reporting by Rodrigo Campos; Editing by Andrew Hay)",2015-07-06,AET,"Mon Jul 6, 2015 | 4:27pm EDT","US STOCKS-Energy leads Wall St lower with eyes on Greece, China",http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-stocks-usa-idUSL1N0ZM24620150706?type=companyNews

201,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 07 (Fitch) The for-profit hospital industry is well positioned  with respect to the anticipated wave of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) amongst  the largest for-profit health insurers, but consolidation could have some  important longer term ramifications, according to Fitch Ratings. M&A amongst health insurers is not likely to immediately result in outright  price pressure for hospitals. In many markets, health insurers are already  fairly consolidated and recent actions by hospitals to build market presence  will shore up negotiating power. However, over the longer term it could have a  negative effect on competition by smaller insurers in some markets. In addition,  it could accelerate the nascent shift towards value based payments for hospitals  and other healthcare providers if larger insurers find it financially beneficial  to advance the use of these payment models.  The planned tie-up of Aetna and Humana could create the second largest national  for-profit health insurer by revenue if approved by anti-trust regulators. The  announcement of the merger comes on the back of some favorable developments for  the hospital industry. Most importantly, the U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled  that more than 6 million enrollees in the public health insurance exchange plans  created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA) can keep the financial subsidies that  make these plans more affordable. In part because of the ACA-related expansion  of health insurance coverage, hospitals have recently experienced a marked  improvement in organic operating trends, particularly in growth of volumes of  patients.  Actions by hospital management teams to respond to certain challenges in the  operating environment are also contributing to the industry's improved  performance. These same activities are now encouraging consolidation by health  insurers. Horizontal M&A activity amongst acute care hospitals to build bigger  systems with more negotiating clout with payors has been a durable trend since  the passage of the ACA in early 2010. More recently, hospitals have been  expanding their presence in key geographies through acquisitions and financial  partnerships in adjacent care delivery verticals as well as taking actions to  improve financial alignment with physicians.  Hospital companies will begin reporting 2Q15 results later this month. Many of  the trends supporting the industry's recently improved performance remain  intact, so Fitch expects another quarter of decent results. However, volume  growth in particular is likely to back-off the very strong results posted in the  past couple quarters.

202,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed the ratings of Aetna Inc.  (Aetna) on Rating Watch Negative. The rating action follows Aetna's recent  announcement that it has reached an agreement to acquire Humana Inc. (Humana) in  a cash and stock transaction valued at approximately $37 billion. A full list of  rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating action reflects Fitch's concern about Aetna's expected financial  leverage metrics following the close of the transaction, as well as potential  operational and/or earnings disruptions that could arise as these two very large  and complex organizations are integrated.  Assuming the acquisition and its financing are completed as currently  envisioned, upon close of the acquisition Fitch expects to downgrade Aetna's  ratings by one notch. Fitch notes that Aetna's financial leverage has not fully  returned to the level at which the company operated prior to its acquisition of  Coventry Health Care, Inc. in 2013, although the company has been progressing in  line with expectations. At close of the acquisition, Fitch expects Aetna's financial leverage to be  approximately 46%, and debt to EBITDA to be in excess of 3.0x due to the debt  being issued to fund the cash portion of the purchase price. Fitch does not  anticipate that Aetna's financial leverage metrics will return to a level  appropriate for its current rating category within a 12 to 24 month time horizon  normally associated with a Rating Outlook. Given Aetna's size and business  profile, these metrics at its current rating would be a run-rate debt to EBITDA  ratio approximating 1.8x and financial leverage of 30-35%. The ratings of Humana have also historically reflected Fitch's view that  Medicare Advantage (MA) enrollment generally supports lower ratings relative to  employer group and individual enrollment due to the U.S. government's large role  in the MA market and the suppressive effect this role has in terms of margins  and capital formation. As a large portion of Humana's revenue is associated with  MA business, Aetna's exposure to this business will increase significantly at  close of the transaction. Fitch views the combination of Aetna and Humana as strategically beneficial to  both organizations in terms of the application of Aetna's strong performance in  commercial risk business to Humana's commercial block, geographic and business  diversification, particularly with regard to Humana, as well as stronger  provider networks and pharmacy claims costs. RATING SENSITIVITIES At the close of the transaction, Fitch expects to downgrade the ratings of Aetna  by one notch, at which time Fitch will establish new rating triggers associated  with the combined company's new ratings. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has placed the following ratings on Watch Negative: Aetna Inc. --$750 million of 3.50% senior unsecured notes due Nov. 15, 2024 'A-'; --$250 million of 1.75% senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2017 'A-'; --$500 million of 1.5% senior unsecured notes due Nov. 15, 2017 'A-'; --$383 million of 5.95% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2017 'A-'; --$375 million of 2.2% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2019 'A-'; --$750 million of 3.95% senior unsecured notes due Sept. 1, 2020 'A-'; --$500 million of 4.125% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2021 'A-'; --$600 million of 5.450% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2021 'A-';  --$1 billion of 2.75% senior unsecured notes due Nov. 15, 2022 'A-'; --$771 million of 6.625% senior unsecured notes due June 15, 2036 'A-'; --$534 million of 6.75% senior unsecured notes due Dec. 15, 2037 'A-'; --$500 million of 4.5% senior unsecured notes due May 15, 2042 'A-'; --$500 million of 4.125% senior unsecured notes due Nov. 15, 2042 'A-'; --$375 million of 4.75% senior unsecured notes due March 15, 2044 'A-'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --$2 billion commercial paper program 'F1'.

203,"   By Leela Parker Deo and Karen Schwartz | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) is lining up a $16.2 billion bridge loan to fund its acquisition of smaller rival Humana Inc (HUM.N), which is the first multibillion M&A loan of the second half of 2015 and the second-largest acquisition bridge loan so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters LPC data.Aetna said on July 3 that it would buy Humana for $37 billion in cash and stock in the insurance industry’s largest-ever acquisition.The deal will boost third quarter investment grade loan issuance and support expectations that a surplus of corporate cash is contributing to a growing pipeline of M&A transactions.Investment grade M&A-related lending totaled $63 billion in the first half of the year. 2015 totals could reach $200 billion based on the pipeline of financings building in the second half of the year, according to a lender survey by Thomson Reuters LPC.The merger is the latest transaction amid ongoing consolidation in the health insurance sector and was announced just before global markets were roiled by the decisive July 5 referendum in Greece which rejected additional harsh austerity measures and China’s attempts to stabilize its ailing stock market.These macroeconomic developments and slumping oil and iron ore prices have the potential to disrupt the syndicated loan market, but dislocation is more likely to be felt by non-investment grade companies rather than high-grade issuers, one analyst said.Highly rated companies are in a relatively strong position to attract financing because of their credit profiles, he noted, and tend to benefit from any flight to quality in a risk-off environment. “I won’t say it’s not going to be somewhat choppy. The marketplace always tends to be somewhat choppier when you have these big geopolitical issues popping up. It’s just one of several things they’re going to need to navigate over the next six months,” the analyst said.HEALTHY BRIDGE Citigroup and UBS are providing the 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility, according to regulatory filings. The bridge loan is expected to be taken out with permanent financing that could include a mix of term debt, bonds and commercial paper, sources said. Citigroup and UBS are currently syndicating a $3.2 billion, three-year term loan, the sources added. If the merger clears antitrust scrutiny, it will dwarf the previous largest ever insurance deal announced in early July, when Swiss property and casualty giant ACE Ltd (ACE.N) said it was buying Chubb Corp (CB.N) for $28 billion, Reuters reported.In the past two weeks, Anthem also has offered to buy Cigna Corp to create the largest insurer in the country, toppling UnitedHealth Group Inc, according to Reuters, as U.S. insurers grapple with the issue of providing universal coverage, which is a key policy of Barak Obama’s presidency.“We’re through this tunnel of managing through at least the initial implementation phase of the ACA [Affordable Care Act],” said the analyst. “Companies are now thinking more strongly about how they want to position in the next 3-5 years, and I think M&A will increasingly be a part of that thought process.” The acquisition gives Aetna a strong leg up in government-sponsored managed Medicare, a growth market in the health insurance sector, the analyst added. “This will vault them into a leadership position, assuming the deal goes through.”The bridge loan pricing is tied to a ratings grid, ranging from 75bp-125bp over Libor.Pricing opens at 100bp over Libor based on Aetna’s senior unsecured debt ratings of Baa1/A/A- and the loan pays a 10bp commitment fee. Pricing includes 25bp margin step-ups at 90, 180 and 270 days, respectively, after closing. The loan also pays duration fees, a periodic fee on the outstanding balance of the bridge loan, of 50bp, 75bp and 100bp, according to the same schedule.The deal, which is expected to close in the second half of 2016, is also being financed through $3.4 billion of available cash, and $16 billion of new shares. Humana’s existing debt of $3.8 billion will be assumed.Aetna expects to maintain a solid investment grade rating and access to short-term debt markets.

205,"   By Caroline Humer, Karen Freifeld and Diane Bartz | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON U.S. insurance regulators and state attorneys general are lining up to scrutinize Aetna Inc's proposed $33 billion takeover of rival Humana Inc for potential harm to consumers, complicating what is already expected to be a tough and lengthy review by federal antitrust authorities.Insurance commissioners in 18 states including Texas, Kentucky and Florida will study merger documents provided by Humana to determine whether the deal will harm competition and lead to higher insurance premiums or diminished access to healthcare providers, according to Reuters interviews with regulators and insurance experts.At least three state attorneys general - in Florida, Mississippi and Massachusetts - said they will look at the proposed acquisition. Local politicians and medical industry groups such as the American Medical Association have also voiced concerns about the biggest deal ever in the U.S. health insurance industry.The Department of Justice is taking the lead on the transaction and may ask for asset sales or challenge a deal in court. But the concerns of state insurance commissioners are likely to have added weight since health insurance is heavily regulated at the local level, antitrust experts said. State regulators are also expected to provide the DOJ with their own data on how the deal will affect insurance markets.""The antitrust division makes the final decision on the competitive analysis but will take into account the information provided by the states,"" said Andre Barlow, an antitrust lawyer at Doyle, Barlow and Mazard PLLC, who's not involved in the inquiry.The proposed acquisition comes after years of health insurance change driven by the politically divisive Affordable Care Act, often called Obamacare. Republicans say the new law has driven insurance costs higher and hurt consumers, while Democrats say it is insuring more people. Aetna and Humana have said that because the health insurance market is now more focused on consumers, being bigger will let them offer more competitive products.When the nation's largest insurer, UnitedHealth Group , bought Nevada's Sierra Health Services in 2008, the Nevada Attorney General and the DOJ both filed antitrust complaints and signed off on a settlement requiring UnitedHealth to divest administration and sales of Medicare Advantage plans for seniors and the disabled in two counties.In 2004, California's state regulator first rejected the acquisition of WellPoint Health Networks by Anthem. The companies challenged the move in court and eventually agreed to concessions, including putting $265 million towards California health projects that would benefit consumers. The Humana purchase would create a company with more than 33 million customers in two-thirds of the United States. In individual states, their footprint is much bigger.In a combined Medicare Advantage business, Aetna and Humana would have an 88 percent market share in Kansas, 80 percent in West Virginia, 58 percent in Iowa and 51 percent in Missouri, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. In commercial insured plans, the new company would have more than a third of individual customers in Florida, Illinois and Kansas and 68 percent of Georgia, according to SG Cowen and SNL Financial.Healthcare investors already have concerns over the Humana deal passing muster at the federal level, particularly after antitrust objections scuttled several other major transactions this year, including Sysco Corp's proposed purchase of US Foods and Comcast Corp's planned acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc. They are also weighing the risk of another major health insurance merger being forged, possibly between Anthem Inc  and Cigna Corp. In that case, antitrust authorities would have to account for the market effect of both deals when raising any objections. The value of Aetna's cash and stock offer has dropped 10 percent since it was announced on July 3, as its share price fell over antitrust risk and other concerns. Aetna and Humana have said they view the regulatory process as ""manageable,"" targeting a deal closing in the second half of 2016 to account for a lengthy review. Aetna and Humana both declined to comment on antitrust issues for this story.STATE BY STATE California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones plans to talk to antitrust authorities and other states through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners about the Humana deal's impact on California, where he sees even their combined 5 percent share as an issue. ""I will be raising whatever concerns I have on behalf of California consumers,"" Jones said in an interview. ""I am generally concerned that historically health insurance company mergers have resulted in higher, not lower, premiums for consumers.""For example, insurance premiums rose 13.7 percent in Nevada in the year after UnitedHealth Group's acquisition of Sierra Health Services compared to health plans in a similar market that was not affected, according to a 2013 study published in the journal Health Management, Policy and Innovation.In Kentucky, where Humana is based, Insurance Commissioner Sharon Clark said her department would work with federal regulators as they evaluate the transaction as well as conduct its own review, which could take six months to a year to complete.Georgia state commissioner Charles Hudgens said in a statement he will perform an in-depth analysis of the proposed transaction's effect on competition in the state. Texas, Illinois and Florida said they are also awaiting filings from Humana.State attorneys general may also look at the deal, but often don't disclose if they have opened an investigation.In Connecticut, where Aetna is based, a spokesman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen declined to comment on whether the office plans to probe the deal. ""In Connecticut, the AG has the independent authority to look into mergers and to challenge them if it will lessen competition under the state's antitrust laws,"" Robert Blanchard said.In Kentucky, where Humana is based, a spokesman for Attorney General Jack Conway said his office will look at the terms of the potential merger when they are released and determine if any action is necessary. In Florida, where Humana has 1.63 million customers, a spokeswoman for Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said the state would look into the proposed merger for its effect on competition.",2015-07-10,AET,"Fri Jul 10, 2015 | 5:59pm EDT",States line up to scrutinize Aetna's $33 bln Humana deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/humana-ma-aetna-antitrust-idUSL1N0ZQ2BQ20150710?type=companyNews

In a combined Medicare Advantage business, Aetna and Humana would have an 88 percent market share in Kansas, 80 percent in West Virginia, 58 percent in Iowa and 51 percent in Missouri, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. In commercial insured plans, the new company would have more than a third of individual customers in Florida, Illinois and Kansas and 68 percent of Georgia, according to SG Cowen and SNL Financial. Healthcare investors already have concerns over the Humana deal passing muster at the federal level, particularly after antitrust objections scuttled several other major transactions this year, including Sysco Corp's proposed purchase of US Foods and Comcast Corp's planned acquisition of Time Warner Cable Inc. They are also weighing the risk of another major health insurance merger being forged, possibly between Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N). In that case, antitrust authorities would have to account for the market effect of both deals when raising any objections.The value of Aetna's cash and stock offer has dropped 10 percent since it was announced on July 3, as its share price fell over antitrust risk and other concerns. Aetna and Humana have said they view the regulatory process as ""manageable,"" targeting a deal closing in the second half of 2016 to account for a lengthy review. Aetna and Humana both declined to comment on antitrust issues for this story.      STATE BY STATE California Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones plans to talk to antitrust authorities and other states through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners about the Humana deal’s impact on California, where he sees even their combined 5 percent share as an issue. ""I will be raising whatever concerns I have on behalf of California consumers,"" Jones said in an interview. ""I am generally concerned that historically health insurance company mergers have resulted in higher, not lower, premiums for consumers.""    For example, insurance premiums rose 13.7 percent in Nevada in the year after UnitedHealth Group's acquisition of Sierra Health Services compared to health plans in a similar market that was not affected, according to a 2013 study published in the journal Health Management, Policy and Innovation. In Kentucky, where Humana is based, Insurance Commissioner Sharon Clark said her department would work with federal regulators as they evaluate the transaction as well as conduct its own review, which could take six months to a year to complete.Georgia state commissioner Charles Hudgens said in a statement he will perform an in-depth analysis of the proposed transaction's effect on competition in the state. Texas, Illinois and Florida said they are also awaiting filings from Humana.State attorneys general may also look at the deal, but often don't disclose if they have opened an investigation. In Connecticut, where Aetna is based, a spokesman for Connecticut Attorney General George Jepsen declined to comment on whether the office plans to probe the deal. ""In Connecticut, the AG has the independent authority to look into mergers and to challenge them if it will lessen competition under the state's antitrust laws,"" Robert Blanchard said. In Kentucky, where Humana is based, a spokesman for Attorney General Jack Conway said his office will look at the terms of the potential merger when they are released and determine if any action is necessary. In Florida, where Humana has 1.63 million customers, a spokeswoman for Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said the state would look into the proposed merger for its effect on competition.

And public hospitals in those states, many of which rely on bond markets for funding, are likely to feel the pinch even more acutely over time, experts said.""Providers in these states are going to be at a disadvantage,"" said Jim LeBuhn, senior director at Fitch Ratings. ""It's going to make it that much more challenging for these providers to maintain their financial profiles.""Since the Affordable Care Act's first open enrollment in 2013, the number of Americans covered under Medicaid has risen by 21 percent, to 71.1 million.

In contrast, according to Moody's, such ""hospitals in non-expansion states saw bad debt increase through much of the year.""Hospitals in Medicaid expansion states, according to Kaiser, reported an average 32 percent decrease in uninsured patients and a 40 percent cut in unreimbursed costs of care for patients without the ability to pay, known in the industry as charity care costs.

Medicaid also increased the likelihood of receiving preventive care, such as mammograms and cholesterol checks.A TALE OF TWO HOSPITALS  Both Cook County and Grady are safety-net hospitals based in urban counties where the poverty level is slightly higher than the national average, and both have handled high numbers of uninsured clients in recent years: about half of the patients at Cook and nearly a third at Grady.Since Obamacare took effect, the numbers at the Georgia hospital have remained about the same. But things have changed dramatically at the Illinois hospital, in large part due to the area's enrollment of about 170,000 of an estimated 330,000 eligible for the expanded Medicaid.""This has been a sea change for us,"" said Dr. John Jay Shannon, Cook County Health's chief executive.Within two years, the percent of uninsured patients at the hospital had dropped from more than a half to about a third, almost entirely driven by increased Medicaid coverage, hospital data show. And for the first time in the hospital's history, a majority of the patients it treated had coverage. A third of the new Medicaid enrollees treated at Cook County were patients new to the system. And, hospital administrators say, those with chronic diseases such as diabetes, who used to be frequent emergency room visitors, now have personal physicians to help them manage their conditions.In the fiscal year ending in November 2014, uncompensated charity care dropped to $342 million from $500 million the year before. Funding from Medicaid nearly doubled the health system's operating revenues, a major reason that, after ending 2013 with a net loss of $67.6 million, Cook County Health finished its most recent fiscal year in the black.Now, the provider, like other safety-net hospitals, has a new challenge: holding onto old clients.""For the first time in our history, we need to compete for our patients,"" said Shannon. ""A world of improved access is also a world of choice.""At Grady Health System in Atlanta, meanwhile, the number of patients covered by insurance increased by less than 2 percent last year.

209,"  * Combined company would be No. 1 insurer, cover 53 mln members* Antitrust review would include proposed Aetna buy of Humana* U.S. lawmakers, medical group express concern for consumers   (Adds details on antitrust review, concerns from lawmakers, Breakingviews link)By Ankur Banerjee and Ransdell PiersonJuly 24 Anthem Inc said on Friday it would buy Cigna Corp for about $54.2 billion, creating the largest U.S. health insurer by membership and accelerating the industry's consolidation from five national players to three.The proposed acquisition, the health insurance industry's largest, comes three weeks after Aetna Inc agreed to buy Humana Inc for $37 billion.Health insurers are finding it tougher to raise prices following the roll-out of President Barack Obama's healthcare law, while grappling with soaring expenses of medications including cancer drugs that can cost each patient more than $100,000 a year. Anthem said buying Cigna would help it reduce costs and negotiate lower prices with doctors and hospitals.State insurance regulators and federal antitrust authorities are expected to scrutinize how the Anthem-Cigna and Aetna-Humana deals would affect competition for Medicare and individual and commercial insurance.Within a few hours of the announcement, several U.S. lawmakers and a leading physicians group said they feared the pending acquisitions would hurt consumers by raising prices or limiting access to healthcare providers.""The lack of a competitive health insurance market allows the few remaining companies to exploit their market power, dictate premium increases and pursue corporate policies that are contrary to patient interests,"" the American Medical Association (AMA) said in a statement.Under the deal, which the companies expect to close in the second half of 2016, Anthem Chief Executive Joseph Swedish would serve as CEO and chairman. Cigna CEO David Cordani would be president and chief operating officer.In a joint conference call, Swedish told analysts Anthem had no prior discussions ""at all"" with regulators about the deal, but was confident about approval.Shares of Cigna on Friday fell 5.6 percent to $145.72, far below the $188 offered in the buyout, suggesting major Wall Street concern over the antitrust risk. ""Strategically and financially it's very attractive, but they will face regulatory scrutiny,"" said Ana Gupte, analyst with Leerink Partners. ""They also both possibly face divestitures and may have to make concessions to consumers to make the merger go through.""The AMA said its own analysis shows 41 percent of U.S. metropolitan areas already have a single health insurer with a commercial market share of 50 percent or more. It believes the Anthem-Cigna merger would be presumed anticompetitive in at least nine of the states where Anthem operates.""It is imperative that we closely examine changes in the healthcare market, and what has caused these changes, to ensure that consumers are not harmed,"" said Senator Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah who is chairman of the Senate's antitrust panel.Apparent worries about regulatory scrutiny have also hit Humana shares, which closed at $181.76 on Friday, well below the value of Aetna's cash-and-stock offer of $230 per share when it was announced on July 3. BIGGER THAN UNITEDHEALTH Cigna has 15 million members, and about 80 percent of its business is with self-insured companies which pay it a management fee, according to Leerink. It also serves large and small employers, Medicare Advantage customers and individuals.About 61 percent of Anthem's 39 million members are served through self-insured companies, while 15 percent have Medicaid coverage. Large and small group policies make up about 12 percent of its business, while Medicare Advantage accounts for 1 percent.The combined company would have about 53 million members, surpassing UnitedHealth Group's 45.86 million as of June 30.Anthem said it will pay $103.40 in cash and 0.5152 of its shares for each Cigna share. The deal is valued at $181.12 per share based on Anthem's Friday close of $150.86. Anthem said on Friday the offer was valued at $188 per share based on its stock price on May 28 before media reports surfaced that the two companies were in talks.The offer's equity portion is valued at $49.11 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on 261.2 million Cigna shares outstanding as of March 31.Another question is whether Anthem would violate rules of  the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, a federation of 36 independent insurers of which it is the biggest member.The association collectively insures 106 million Americans. Anthem provides coverage to the most people and operates in 14 states. No other Blue Cross member operates in more than five states.Blue Cross operators are not supposed to compete with one another, but Cigna does compete against Blue Cross members in a handful of states, which could cause controversy in the association.""There will no doubt be debate among the board of directors,"" said a person knowledgeable about Blue Cross who requested anonymity to protect business relationships.""We will remain Blue,"" Swedish said on the conference call, adding that Anthem feels confident that even after acquiring Cigna, the combined company will satisfy ""the Blue rules.""Swedish said he would serve as CEO for only two years, and remain as chairman afterward. Cordani could be a contender for the CEO role at that point, but no guarantees were provided, said a source familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because the person was unauthorized to publicly discuss details of the transaction.Both Anthem and Cigna would be liable to pay the other a fee equivalent to 3.8 percent of the deal's value if either walks away from the planned merger.Anthem's lead financial adviser is UBS Investment Bank. Credit Suisse also served as financial adviser, and White & Case LLP as legal adviser.Morgan Stanley is Cigna's financial adviser and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP its legal adviser.

212,"  Health insurer Humana Inc (HUM.N), which earlier this month agreed to be bought by Aetna Inc (AET.N) for $37 billion, on Wednesday reported a rise in a key medical cost metric that missed analyst expectations.Humana's consolidated benefit ratio, or the ratio of its spending on medical claims versus premium revenue it takes in, was 85.2 percent compared with 83.1 percent a year ago.   Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said in a research note that the ratio was 50 basis points worse than Wall Street consensus.Investors closely watch this ratio as a sign of whether insurers, who have benefited from years of low medical use and claims, will be caught out by sudden shifts in demand. Humana first said in early July that costs related to the rate of hospital admissions among Medicare customers were higher than it had anticipated. It cut its 2015 outlook by 8 percent and shares fell at that time. On Wednesday, Humana said medical costs have not worsened since it issued that outlook earlier this month. It reiterated that it believes it has priced its 2016 premium rates to cover these costs, indicating that this key metric should improve. Humana had missed analyst expectations several quarters in a row because of cost issues, contributing to investor skepticism about the Aetna deal. The deal is also expected to face antitrust scrutiny as regulators weigh the impact of the combination on competition. Authorities are also expected to closely look at Anthem Inc's (ANTM.N) $54 billion purchase of Cigna Corp (CI.N) and require some asset sales.    The managed care sector is consolidating as insurers seek to cut costs and negotiate with doctors and hospitals over pricing. Humana shares were off 0.5 percent at $183.59 in Wednesday morning trade. Aetna was off 2 cents at $112.29.Excluding tax benefits from the sale of Concerta Inc, Humana earned $1.67 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.63 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On that basis, it had reported earnings of $2.19 per share in the year-ago quarter.

213,"  (New throughout)July 29 Health insurer Humana Inc, which earlier this month agreed to be bought by Aetna Inc for $37 billion, on Wednesday reported a rise in a key medical cost metric that missed analyst expectations.Humana's consolidated benefit ratio, or the ratio of its spending on medical claims versus premium revenue it takes in, was 85.2 percent compared with 83.1 percent a year ago.Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said in a research note that the ratio was 50 basis points worse than Wall Street consensus.Investors closely watch this ratio as a sign of whether insurers, who have benefited from years of low medical use and claims, will be caught out by sudden shifts in demand.Humana first said in early July that costs related to the rate of hospital admissions among Medicare customers were higher than it had anticipated. It cut its 2015 outlook by 8 percent and shares fell at that time. On Wednesday, Humana said medical costs have not worsened since it issued that outlook earlier this month. It reiterated that it believes it has priced its 2016 premium rates to cover these costs, indicating that this key metric should improve.Humana had missed analyst expectations several quarters in a row because of cost issues, contributing to investor skepticism about the Aetna deal. The deal is also expected to face antitrust scrutiny as regulators weigh the impact of the combination on competition. Authorities are also expected to closely look at Anthem Inc's  $54 billion purchase of Cigna Corp and require some asset sales.The managed care sector is consolidating as insurers seek to cut costs and negotiate with doctors and hospitals over pricing.Humana shares were off 0.5 percent at $183.59 in Wednesday morning trade. Aetna was off 2 cents at $112.29. Excluding tax benefits from the sale of Concerta Inc, Humana earned $1.67 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.63 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. On that basis, it had reported earnings of $2.19 per share in the year-ago quarter.In early July, the company told analysts to expect earnings of $1.60 to $1.65 per share on an adjusted basis.Net income rose to $431 million, or $2.85 per share, in the second quarter, from $344 million, or $2.19 per share, a year earlier.The company reported revenue of $13.73 billion, which missed the average analyst estimate of $13.81 billion.

214,"   By Caroline Humer  Aetna Inc (AET.N) on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected adjusted net profit for the second quarter and said ""moderate"" medical costs boosted the profitability of its government Medicare and Medicaid plans.The third-largest U.S. health insurer, which is in the process of buying rival Humana Inc (HUM.N), also raised its full-year forecast for adjusted net profit to at least $7.40 per share from $7.20-$7.40.The $37 billion Aetna-Humana combination is part of a consolidation that insurers say will help them offer more competitive products amid changes due to the national healthcare reform law, often called Obamacare. Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N) also plan to merge in a $47 billion deal. The merger trend is also related to medical costs that have risen with the improved economy and as millions more people who have become insured through Obamacare visit doctors and hospitals.Investors are closely watching how these costs impact insurers. Aetna said on Tuesday that its medical cost trends were moderate during the quarter, which helped improve its medical benefit ratio to 81.1 percent from 83.1 percent. The ratio represents the percentage of premium income that an insurer spends on medical claims. Aetna said its second-quarter medical benefit ratio in its government business, which includes Medicare for elderly people and Medicaid for the poor, fell to 80.3 percent from 86.5 percent as it raised premiums and costs remained low. The ratio for its commercial business rose to 81.8 percent from 80.6 percent, reflecting payments it put aside for the risk adjustment program that redistributes the costs of providing individual Obamacare insurance among insurers selling these plans. ""Second quarter results were well above consensus estimates as the company’s government business continued to report better-than-expected performance, while commercial underwriting margins were steady despite the company absorbing a significant hit from a $252 million risk adjustment payable,"" Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Chris Rigg said in a note.Aetna shares closed on Monday at $113.79, up 28 percent this year.Aetna's net profit rose to $731.8 million, or $2.08 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $548.8 million, or $1.52 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $2.05 per share, beating average analyst estimates of $1.82 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 5 percent to $15.24 billion, still short of analyst expectations of $15.43 billion.

241,"  (Recasts to focus on individual exchange business, adds CFO and analyst comments, share prices)By Caroline HumerOct 28 Health insurer Anthem Inc said on Wednesday that its Obamacare insurance business is being hampered by lower-than-anticipated enrollment due to fewer applicants than expected and cheaper premium rates at competitors.Anthem has been one of the biggest and most profitable insurers in the new individual market, which was overhauled in 2014 with new government subsidized plans sold on exchanges created under Obamacare. Now Anthem says that business will drag on profit growth in 2016 and could even affect its long-term 2018 financial target.The comments from the second-largest U.S. health insurer came in its third-quarter financial report, which showed that other government-based businesses had outperformed expectations.Shares of Anthem were down 5.1 percent at $137.35 in morning trading. Cigna Corp, which Anthem has announced plans to buy, was down 3.2 percent while shares of Aetna Inc, which reports on Thursday, were down 2.8 percent.""We're trending the wrong direction on enrollment,"" Anthem Chief Financial Officer Wayne DeVeydt told investors on a conference call. The company lost 69,000 exchange customers during the quarter, ending with 824,000 customers. It has 1.75 million total individual customers. Anthem, which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in more than a dozen states, said it expects continued enrollment declines in the fourth quarter and that 2016 will be weak as competitors undercut prices. After that, it is counting on improvements in 2017 and 2018 when it expects to be able to compete better on prices.Many of its individual customers buy their insurance on the exchanges created under President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law and receive subsidies from the government aimed at making it more affordable. The government expects about 9.1 million people to have this insurance at the end of 2015, a lower target than the 15 million it once aimed for, and for next year expects 10 million people to enroll.Earlier this week, the U.S. government said that in the 37 states where it runs exchanges, the monthly premium rate of the benchmark health insurance plan will increase 7.5 percent on average. DeVeydt said the company was not seeing what hospitals attested to this week: patients dropping coverage because of premium prices.Two weeks ago, UnitedHealth Group Inc disappointed investors when it told them the individual business was cutting into profit this year. Unlike Anthem, it said it expected 2016 to improve.Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte described Anthem's commentary on the call as being ""very cautious"" and noted the pressure from market share losses to other plans that had priced below them in 2016. Anthem said its other businesses did well as more people enrolled for its government plans in Medicare for the elderly and disabled and Medicaid for lower-income families. Medicaid enrollment rose by 786,000 members in the third quarter.Anthem said earnings rose to $654.8 million, or $2.43 per share, from $630.9 million, or $2.22 per share, a year earlier.The company said spending on medical claims as a percentage of premiums rose to 83.6 percent from 82.5 percent a year ago, due to expenses in its individual business. The metric is keenly watched for signs of rising costs.On an adjusted basis, Anthem earned $2.73 per share, well above analysts' average estimate of $2.33 according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose to $19.77 billion from $18.37 billion. Analysts were expecting revenue of $19.64 billion.The company also forecast full-year profit of $10.10-$10.20 per share, below analysts' expectations of $10.22.

243,"  (Adds Hillary Clinton comment, updates shares)By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell PiersonOct 29 Pfizer Inc, the No. 1 U.S. drugmaker, and Botox maker Allergan Plc said they were in friendly talks to create a pharmaceutical colossus but the prospect that the company would seek to avoid U.S. taxes sounded political alarm bells.Both New York-based Pfizer and Dublin-based Allergan said no agreement has been reached and declined to discuss any terms of the deal, which would potentially set up Pfizer to take advantage of Ireland's lower tax rates.Allergan shares rose 6 percent to $304.38 in U.S. trading, while Pfizer closed off 1.9 percent at $34.77.Pfizer is already facing political pushback at home that is only likely to intensify with the U.S. presidential campaign underway, as candidates take aim at high prescription drug prices and companies looking to avoid paying U.S. taxes.A spokesman for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton said the candidate had not seen details of the proposed merger, but is against tax inversion maneuvers, in which U.S. companies relocate overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates.""Clinton is committed to cracking down on so-called 'inversions,' where a company chooses to leave the U.S. on paper to game the tax system, and believes we should reform our tax code to encourage investment in the U.S., rather than shipping earnings and jobs overseas,"" Clinton spokesman Ian Sams said.Democratic U.S. Senator Charles Schumer of New York said in a statement: ""The continued pursuit of inversions, mergers and foreign acquisitions of major U.S. companies for purely tax purposes shows there is a lot more work to be done to stop them.""From the right, developer and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the deal was a reminder that the U.S. tax code needed an overhaul.SMOOTHER PATH ""These corporate inversions take capital and, more importantly, jobs offshore,"" he said in a statement. ""We need leadership in Washington to get the tax code changed so companies will be coming to America, not looking for ways to leave."" Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who has endorsed Trump and launched a $150 million political action committee advocating tax reform to eliminate inversions, said a Pfizer-Allergan deal would result in the loss of the country's 10th largest company to Ireland.Analysts speculated a deal could be all or primarily done with stock because under new U.S. rules aimed at curtailing tax inversions, shareholders of the overseas company must own at least 40 percent of the combined entity.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan suggested a price of $390 per Allergan share, funded by equity and debt. Allergan's U.S.-traded shares soared as high as $316.80 on Thursday.Earlier Thursday before the companies confirmed the talks, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read reiterated his criticism of U.S. corporate taxes.""Our tax rate highly disadvantages American multinational high-tech businesses,"" Read said at a Wall Street Journal event. ""I am fighting with one hand tied behind my back.""Pfizer's effective tax rate is 25 percent, while Allergan's is 15 percent. Given that both sides characterized the talks as ""friendly,"" Pfizer is likely to have a much smoother path outside of the United States after running into intense political opposition in Britain and from AstraZeneca Plc's  board in its failed, unsolicited bid last year.""It's definitely a far easier target for Pfizer than AstraZeneca,"" said Christophe Eggmann, investment director at GAM, who holds shares in both companies. ""The hurdle will really be the price.""Moody's Investor Service said the deal would have ""credit positive implications for both companies.""A tax inversion is being discussed in the current talks, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. In its pursuit of AstraZeneca, Pfizer had hoped to employ such a strategy.Read said Thursday he was open to any moves that produce the best long-term value for the company and shareholders. He said he was looking at various growth strategies, including a deal.Pfizer is expected to decide by late next year whether to sell or spin off its older, off-patent products unit to pare the business and focus on innovative, patent-protected medicines. Allergan, the product of a recent merger with generic drugmaker Actavis, is selling a large portfolio of generic medicines to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd   for $40.5 billion.CASH FROM BOTOX A purchase of Allergan, with a market value of more than $113 billion, would be the biggest in Pfizer's long history of huge deals, eclipsing the $90 billion Warner-Lambert acquisition through which it gained control of Lipitor, once the world's top-selling medicine.It would also restore the Viagra maker as the world's largest pharmaceutical company, worth about $330 billion, a position it relinquished after Lipitor went off-patent.Allergan expects revenue of more than $8 billion in the second half of 2015, not including generic drugs it is selling to Teva.Pfizer has annual sales of about $48 billion, with about $27 billion from patent-protected drugs, consumer products and vaccines, and about $21 billion from the business it is considering selling.Since the Warner-Lambert purchase, Pfizer has acquired Pharmacia and Wyeth, each deal under a different CEO.The deals have led to many thousands of job cuts. It is not known how many cuts would result from a tie-up with Allergan.Apart from the tax considerations, the deal would give Pfizer access to Allergan's wrinkle treatment Botox, with $2.4 billion in annual sales, and its $1.3 billion Restasis dry eye treatment.By Sept. 10, deal-making in all sectors of healthcare this year had reached a record $447.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.Other large pending tie-ups include pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc's planned purchase of smaller rival Rite Aid Corp announced this week, and pending mergers of health insurers Aetna Inc with Humana Inc, and Anthem Inc with Cigna Corp.(Additional reporting by Gregory Roumeliotis and Caroline Humer in New York, Vidya L Nathan in Bengaluru, Ben Hirschler in London and Amanda Becker in Littleton, N.H.; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Christian Plumb)",2015-10-29,AET,"Thu Oct 29, 2015 | 6:02pm EDT","UPDATE 5-Pfizer, Allergan drug merger talks raise tax hackles in U.S.",http://www.reuters.com//article/allergan-ma-pfizer-idUSL3N12T51K20151029?type=companyNews

246,"  * UnitedHealth to decide next year about leaving exchanges* CEO says Obamacare exchanges are not sustainable business* Shares fall 5.5 percent, weigh on other insurers, hospitals   (New throughout, adds outside comment)By Caroline HumerNov 19 UnitedHealth Group Inc said it may exit the individual insurance exchanges created under U.S. President Barack Obama's healthcare law, raising new questions about the long-term sustainability of a key Obamacare program.The largest U.S. health insurer said weak enrollment and high medical costs for exchange members were taking too big a toll on its performance. It will evaluate during the first half of next year whether it will offer Obamacare plans in 2017.Rivals Aetna Inc and Anthem Inc said last month that they were seeing too few people enroll, but have not said they were considering exiting the business.""We cannot sustain these losses,"" UnitedHealth Chief Executive Stephen Hemsley said during a conference call with investors. ""We can't really subsidize a marketplace that doesn't appear at the moment to be sustaining itself.""A deterioration in the exchanges in the midst of the 2016 election campaign could give ammunition to Republican candidates opposed to the health care law. Democrats could also face pressure if UnitedHealth and other players depart the exchanges because less competition could mean higher insurance premiums.The U.S. government said the exchanges were growing and giving millions of Americans access to affordable insurance. Enrollment for 2016 opened earlier this month.""We continue to see more people signing up for health insurance and more issuers entering the marketplaces,"" U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Ben Wakana said in email. ""Today's statement by one issuer is not indicative of the marketplace's strength and viability."" UnitedHealth shares fell 5.5 percent on Thursday, while Aetna lost 7.2 percent and Anthem dropped 6.4 percent. Shares of hospital operators, which had benefited in recent years from an increase in insured patients, also fell, with HCA Holdings Inc  down 5.9 percent and Community Health Systems  down 8.5 percent.More than 9 million people are enrolled through the exchanges, which operate in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Most policyholders receive government subsidies to help pay for the plans, based on household income.UnitedHealth has reversed course on its expectations. Last month, it predicted substantial improvement in 2016 for the Obamacare business. Since then, Hemsley said, the enrollment picture has worsened, making it clearer the medical costs of new customers are unsustainable.The Obama administration recently estimated that 10 million people would enroll in 2016, far below the forecast of 20 million sign-ups issued by the Congressional Budget Office in June.UnitedHealth has about 500,000 members with Obamacare plans, making it the fourth-largest insurer on the exchanges. On Thursday, the company said it expected these plans to hurt current-quarter profit by $425 million, or 26 cents per share. As a result, the company cut its full-year earnings forecast to $6 per share from a previous range of $6.25 to $6.35.UnitedHealth also said it was pulling back on 2016 marketing for these plans and that they had raised premiums, which should slow growth in the individual business.For next year, it forecast earnings of $7.10 to $7.30 per share. Analysts on average are expecting $7.28, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.NEW COST CONCERNS  UnitedHealth had entered a small number of markets in 2014, the first year the exchanges opened. It began selling plans in about two dozen states in 2015. It is still a smaller player on these markets than Anthem, Aetna and Humana Inc.""United's experience is unique. They got in late and they entered into some very competitive markets,"" said Dan Mendelson, president of consultancy Avalere Health. ""That said, I think that every insurer is having a harder time in 2016 than they had in 2015, and that they are all going to evaluate this carefully.""UnitedHealth was in many markets where competitors could be helped by its departure, he said.Spokeswomen for Anthem and Aetna did not provide any new comment on their plans regarding the exchanges.If large insurers do exit, the exchanges could be dominated by smaller providers who specialize in Medicaid health plans for the poor, said Kaiser Family Foundation senior vice president Larry Levitt.Insurers had criticized the exchanges before they opened, due to technology problems with the federal government-run HealthCare.gov website and concerns about the cost of covering customers who might be sicker than the general population.The Obama administration mitigated some of that risk in the first year with payments to insurers, but that funding has declined. About a dozen nonprofit cooperative health plans that sold plans on the exchanges have collapsed.Consumers have criticized plans for high out-of-pocket deductibles that must be paid before coverage kicks in, as well as steep increases in monthly premiums from year to year.While the administration could try to boost funding to help mitigate insurer losses, such a plan would not be likely to find support from either political party.""I don't think any Democrats would want to spend political capital on that right now,"" said Yevgeniy Feyman, deputy director of health policy at the Manhattan Institute.

249,"   By Caroline Humer  U.S. health insurers Aetna Inc (AET.N) and Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) on Friday sought to reassure investors that their Obamacare businesses had not worsened after UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) warned of mounting losses in that sector.Aetna and Anthem said their individual insurance businesses, which include the plans created by President Barack Obama's national healthcare reform law, had performed in line with projections through October. Both backed their earnings forecasts for 2015. The announcements came the day after UnitedHealth cut its earnings forecast and said it might exit the Obamacare exchanges in 2017. It said it was losing money on that business because of low enrollment and high costs. Anthem remains committed to the exchanges and to ""continuing our dialogue with policymakers and regulators regarding how we can improve the stability of the individual market,"" Chief Executive Officer Joseph Swedish said in a statement.Enrollment for 2016 exchange plans opened earlier this month. In October, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services forecast about 10 million people would have plans next year, significantly below industry expectations of 20 million. Enrollment in 2015 also fell short of initial goals, and insurers say that trend has made it difficult to price their plans.  About a dozen start-up cooperative insurers have collapsed this year, driven out of the business by paying more medical claims than expected. Also, government payments to mitigate the costs of insuring sicker-than-expected members are declining and will be mostly phased out after next year. Aetna shares, which had fallen 7 percent on Thursday, rose 4.1 percent to $103.97 on Friday. Anthem, the second-largest player on the exchanges, was up 2.5 percent at $131.10 after dropping 9 percent the previous day, and UnitedHealth gained 2.1 percent to $113.00 after a 6 percent decline. Aetna said it still expected 2015 operating earnings of $7.45 to $7.55 per share, and Anthem reiterated its outlook of $9.53 to $9.63 per share. Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said Aetna's statement showed the company had already factored in the individual business' challenges to its forecasts. Aetna and Anthem had referred back to earlier comments when asked on Thursday about UnitedHealth's commentary.In October, Aetna had said it was not making money from the business, which sells government-subsidized plans on exchanges created under the U.S. Affordable Care Act but that profitability could improve next year. It has about 815,000 members in plans on the exchanges.Anthem said last month that 2016 would be a challenging year on the exchanges, where it has about 824,000 customers, and that the business would drag on profit. The earnings affirmations echo that of Centene Corp (CNC.N) and Molina Healthcare Inc (MOH.N). The small health insurers, which focus on Medicaid, also said its exchange business was performing in line with its expectations.Molina CEO J. Mario Molina said that Molina was targeting low-income people, similar to its Medicaid patients, and that it was not having the same problems as UnitedHealth.Kaiser Permanente, a hospital and insurer system, also said that it was ""strongly committed"" to the exchanges.

Shares of Electrolux, which sought to double its U.S. sales with the purchase, tumbled on the news, and the company said it will now focus on developing existing brands such as Frigidaire, Kenmore and Tappan and could look at other acquisitions. The U.S. Justice Department had filed a lawsuit in July asking a judge to stop the deal, arguing that it would push appliance prices up by 5 percent. Electrolux, GE and larger competitor Whirlpool (WHR.N) make up more than 90 percent of major kitchen appliances sold to homebuilders, according to the lawsuit.""This deal was bad for the millions of consumers who buy cooking appliances every year.

254,"   By Diane Bartz  Dec 7 - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said it has filed a complaint aimed at stopping Staples Inc, the nation's largest office supply store, from buying its top rival, Office Depot Inc.Canada's Competition Bureau also said on Monday it would challenge the proposed transaction, which has received the green light from competition authorities in China, Australia and New Zealand.Office Depot's shares fell as much as 17.6 percent to a year low of $5.46, while Staples' stock dropped 13.6 percent to a year low of $10.68.""The commission has reason to believe that the proposed merger between Staples and Office Depot is likely to eliminate beneficial competition that large companies rely on to reduce the costs of office supplies,"" FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a statement. (1.usa.gov/1NeaaD9)The FTC said Staples and Office Depot were often the top two bidders for large business customers and the deal would hurt customers who wanted nationwide contracts for office supplies. The companies said in a statement on Monday that they would fight the FTC in court, arguing that they face stiff competition from manufacturers who sell their own products, e-commerce companies, big box stores and others.The deal is also being investigated by EU regulators, who in September raised concerns about possible price hikes.The FTC stopped a merger attempt between the same two companies in 1997 on similar concerns.

257,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit seeking to force the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt a rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose political contributions.U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer in Washington, D.C. found no showing by the plaintiff Stephen Silberstein that the SEC had a ""clear legal duty"" to begin a rulemaking proceeding, and that its failure was arbitrary and capricious.She also said she lacked jurisdiction to consider whether the SEC engaged in ""unreasonable delay"" by ignoring Silberstein's rulemaking petition. Collyer said such a claim might be raised before a federal appeals court.The lawsuit was filed last May by the nonprofit Campaign for Accountability on behalf of Silberstein, an Aetna Inc shareholder who had unsuccessfully sued the insurer in New York to force it to reveal its political donations.Silberstein said improved disclosure is necessary in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's Citizens United decision in 2010, which allowed unlimited independent spending by corporations and labor unions in federal elections.

259,"   By Caroline Humer | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Aetna Inc (AET.N) Chief Executive Mark Bertolini said on Tuesday that he still expects the company's $37 billion acquisition of rival Humana Inc (HUM.N) to close this year.The deal is being reviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice, which has been seeking documents about Aetna's and Humana's business as it assesses how the deal, and a pending $47 billion combination of Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna Corp (CI.N), could affect consumers. ""So far, we have nothing to believe it will be any slower than that, or any faster,"" Bertolini said in an interview at the JP Morgan Healthcare conference.The two proposed mergers would be an unprecedented consolidation of the U.S. health insurance industry, and critics have warned it could lead to higher prices for consumers. Insurers say the combinations will give them greater leverage to control rising healthcare costs. Aetna said it expects the regulators to wrap up their document requests in the next month, and then the company will move onto discussions with them and consider any divestitures that might be needed.Aetna and Humana sell health plans for individuals as well as Medicare Advantage plans for seniors. Humana's operations  does not overlap with Aetna’s large corporate business. U.S. antitrust regulators have recently blocked large mergers in a variety of industries, raising questions among investors about whether Aetna's and Anthem's acquisitions will close. Reuters reported on Monday that about 15 state attorneys general have joined the Justice Department's probe into the insurance mergers, potentially complicating what is already expected to be a tough and lengthy review.The government's joint review of both deals has probably increased the breadth and volume of information that Aetna has supplied, Bertolini said. ""If we were to look at 2016 we have two things to do. Deliver our results, and close our deal,"" he said.

263,"   By Diane Bartz  Aetna Inc's plan to buy smaller insurer Humana Inc for $31 billion will mean seniors will pay higher Medicare Advantage premiums, according to a new report by the think tank Center for American Progress (CAP).Aetna's proposed deal for Humana would combine Aetna's 7 percent of the Medicare Advantage market with Humana's 19 percent, and make it the largest provider, according to CAP, which was founded by John Podesta who worked in the White House under Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.Medicare Advantage is an insurance plan for seniors that is largely paid for by the government but administered by private insurers. The deal is one of two giant insurance mergers announced in July. The other was Anthem's $45 billion bid for Cigna Corp. Deal values were calculated based on Wednesday's closing stock prices.CAP said in one analysis it found that in counties where Aetna competed with Humana, Aetna's average annual premiums were $302 lower. Using a more conservative approach, it determined that Aetna's average annual premiums were $155 less if it competed against Humana, while Humana's premiums were $43 less if it competed against Aetna, CAP said. Aetna said that seniors who are hit with price increases with Medicare Advantage could always switch to traditional Medicare, and that two-thirds of seniors are on traditional Medicare. ""This keeps downward pressure on prices and upward pressure on quality,"" said Aetna spokeswoman Kristine Grow in an email.She also said that Aetna and Humana combined have 4.4 million Medicare Advantage enrollees, about 8 percent of the 54 million people enrolled in Medicare.

272,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S.-based health insurers Cigna Corp and Aetna Inc have struck deals with Novartis AG for a performance-based price for the Swiss drugmaker's new heart drug, Entresto, the companies said on Monday.The agreements are among the few performance-based deals that have been made public by drugmakers and U.S. managed-care companies, which say they have been having more discussions about linking price to health outcomes in order to cut unneeded drug spending.Drug prices jumped about 13 percent in the United States last year, spurring a public outcry and moving the issue onto the campaign platform of Hillary Clinton and other U.S. presidential candidates for the November 2016 election.  Under the agreement, Cigna said its payments to Novartis will be linked to how well the drug improves the relative health of Cigna customers. Entresto is approved for the treatment of chronic heart failure.Specifically, Cigna said payments will be based on a reduction in the proportion of customers who are admitted to hospital for heart failure. The agreement applies to Cigna's commercial business and does not apply to its Medicaid or Medicare plans.Entresto, which costs about $12.50 a day, or $4,560 per year, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July. It is cheaper than some other new drugs, but costs more than analysts expected. The Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review, an independent group that analyzes drug prices, has said the price should be 9 percent lower. Aetna, in an emailed statement, said it signed a value-based agreement with Novartis that is based on the drug replicating results that it achieved during clinical trials. In trials, Entresto cut hospitalizations and the rate of cardiovascular death related to heart failure.Aetna did not provide further information about the terms of the agreement.Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez has publicly discussed  signing more outcome-based pricing deals. A Novartis spokesman on Monday confirmed that the company's head of pharmaceuticals, David Epstein, was referring to Cigna and Aetna when he said during an investor conference call late last month that Novartis had signed deals with two health insurers.Epstein, on the Jan. 27 call, said that under the deals, Novartis had agreed to a base price and a modest rebate, which would fluctuate based on hospitalizations and savings to the plan.

Healthcare wages began rising sharply in 2014 as President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law fueled a surge of hiring at hospitals to treat an influx of newly insured patients.Wages for healthcare workers were up 2.1 percent in the year through May, according to the most recent figures available for the sector released by the Labor Department on Friday. That's about twice the rate of increase logged in mid-2014, just before wages in the sector began to pick up. The wage acceleration that began that year was followed by a rise in healthcare service inflation, from 0.7 percent in the year through September 2015 to a 12-month gain of 1.3 percent in May of this year.

304,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aetna Inc warned in July that it would exit much of the individual Obamacare health insurance market if the government challenged its deal to buy rival Humana Inc, according to a letter it sent to the U.S. Department of Justice.The public release of the letter came after Aetna said on Monday that it would pull out of selling individual insurance on the government-run websites in 11 states, citing financial losses on the business.The company's withdrawal followed similar moves by UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana, representing a blow to the marketplace for the government-subsidized insurance plans created under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law.In the July 5 letter, Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said it would have to cut back because it would be some time before the company recouped the investment it had made in this market over the past 2-1/2 years.""Our ability to withstand these losses is dependent on our achieving anticipated synergies in the Humana acquisition,"" Bertolini wrote. A copy of the letter was posted on the Huffington Post website, which obtained the document though the Freedom of Information Act. ""Unfortunately, a challenge by the DOJ to that acquisition and/or the DOJ successfully blocking the transaction would have a negative financial impact on Aetna and would impair Aetna's ability to continue its support,"" he wrote.Many insurers have said they are losing money because the Obamacare population is sicker than foreseen and the risk-adjustment payments from the government are insufficient. The government has made changes aimed at helping the insurers, which say it has not gone far enough to make the business sustainable.The Justice Department moved on July 21 to block Aetna's acquisition of Humana and Anthem Inc's purchase of Cigna Corp after an antitrust review, saying the two deals would lead to higher prices. Aetna spokesman TJ Crawford said the letter was a response to the department's written request for information. The company's ultimate decision was based on financial information obtained after the letter was sent, he said.""That deterioration, and not the DOJ challenge to our Humana transaction, is ultimately what drove us to announce the narrowing of our public exchange presence for the 2017 plan year,"" Crawford said. The release of the documents is unusual in a Justice Department antitrust investigation.

305,"   By Caroline Humer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Aetna Inc (AET.N) warned in July that it would exit much of the individual Obamacare health insurance market if the government challenged its deal to buy rival Humana Inc (HUM.N), according to a letter it sent to the U.S. Department of Justice.The public release of the letter came after Aetna said on Monday that it would pull out of selling individual insurance on the government-run websites in 11 states, citing financial losses on the business.The company's withdrawal followed similar moves by UnitedHealth Group Inc (UNH.N) and Humana, representing a blow to the marketplace for the government-subsidized insurance plans created under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law.In the July 5 letter, Aetna Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said it would have to cut back because it would be some time before the company recouped the investment it had made in this market over the past 2-1/2 years.""Our ability to withstand these losses is dependent on our achieving anticipated synergies in the Humana acquisition,"" Bertolini wrote. A copy of the letter was posted on the Huffington Post website, which obtained the document though the Freedom of Information Act. ""Unfortunately, a challenge by the DOJ to that acquisition and/or the DOJ successfully blocking the transaction would have a negative financial impact on Aetna and would impair Aetna's ability to continue its support,"" he wrote. Many insurers have said they are losing money because the Obamacare population is sicker than foreseen and the risk-adjustment payments from the government are insufficient. The government has made changes aimed at helping the insurers, which say it has not gone far enough to make the business sustainable.The Justice Department moved on July 21 to block Aetna's acquisition of Humana and Anthem Inc's (ANTM.N) purchase of Cigna Corp (CI.N) after an antitrust review, saying the two deals would lead to higher prices. Aetna spokesman TJ Crawford said the letter was a response to the department's written request for information. The company's ultimate decision was based on financial information obtained after the letter was sent, he said. ""That deterioration, and not the DOJ challenge to our Humana transaction, is ultimately what drove us to announce the narrowing of our public exchange presence for the 2017 plan year,"" Crawford said.The release of the documents is unusual in a Justice Department antitrust investigation.

311,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 12 (Fitch) The U.S. healthcare industry's shift to value has  created a secular upheaval that permeates nearly every sub-sector, says Fitch  Ratings in a report published today.  ""As the industry grapples with a range of issues, it's increasingly clear that  no corner of the healthcare industry will remain totally untouched,"" says Megan  Neuburger, Managing Director, U.S. Corporates. ""All types of healthcare  companies have some imperative to reshape their business models around the shift  to value, and that in itself is creating a host of challenges and opportunities  for them."" During the month of August, Fitch's U.S. healthcare team answered investors'  questions about the trends cited below, which embody the secular challenges  arising from the shift to value.  Lower Acuity Admissions Some acute care hospital operators with operations in rural and small suburban  markets saw weak 2Q16 results. Since it can be difficult to predict the bottom  on inpatient hospital admissions in those types of markets, more of the same may  be in store.  ""Patients and insurers both have price incentives to shift care away from  hospitals with their high fixed costs to higher-value settings,"" says Neuburger.  ""For hospital companies, this highlights the importance of having a strategy to  preserve market share in the long term."" Investments in outpatient facilities like Tenet Healthcare Corp's acquisition of  United Surgical Partners, or divestitures in non-competitive markets like  Community Health Systems' divestiture of Quorum Health Corp, are both long-term  strategies that may be employed by other hospitals, even if they raise execution  risk in the short term.  Health Insurance Consolidation While it is fairly obvious to assume that health insurer consolidation will  erode providers' pricing power, Fitch believes that erosion is overstated  because price negotiations take place market-by-market.  ""Pricing battles will continue to be won and lost at the local market level, so  national breadth - both for insurance companies and providers - does not  necessarily trump in-market depth,"" says Neuburger.  The impact of insurer consolidation on the ACA health insurance marketplaces is  a complex issue. Acute care hospitals in particular are exposed to this issue,  as competitive public insurance markets support lower levels of uninsured  patients and uncompensated care, which will bolster cash flows in the longer  term.  Medicare Reimbursement Reforms Vertical consolidation and rationalization of capacity in some segments has been  necessary for post-acute care (PAC) providers to adjust to Medicare  reimbursement reform. Medicare bundling initiatives will bear fruit for PACs  longer-term through better provider relationships and referral sources. ""Initiatives like the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model will  differentiate PAC providers by how well they reduce financial risk for acute  care hospitals under bundled payments,"" says Neuburger. ""The wheat will separate  from the chaff along the lines of which PACs have the best physician and  referral relationships in place."" The importance of acute care referral relationships will be compounded by the  long-term acute care (LTAC) specific reforms such as site neutral payments and  the 25% rule.  Generic Drug Pricing Amid the headlines on significant drug price increases, there is a juxtaposition  of a small number of very expensive specialty drug launches that either improve  efficacy or are significantly complex to manufacture, and generic drugs with  relatively little clinical differentiation.  ""At the heart of the recent momentum on drug pricing are the effects of  competitive market forces,"" says Neuburger. ""Outside the few drugs making  headlines, the U.S. market for generic pharmaceuticals remains highly  competitive."" Generic pharma will likely remain highly competitive given the number of new  suppliers that entered the market in recent years to accommodate abbreviated new  drug applications (ANDAs). This may squeeze the margins of pharmaceutical  wholesalers and distributors who profit from the purchase and sale of generics.  Opioid Addiction Epidemic Efforts to address increasing levels of narcotics abuse has spurred a shift  among the way opioid drugs are developed, marketed and prescribed.  ""For physicians and policy makers, these efforts constitute rethink of pain  management practices from policy to prescription,"" says Neuburger.  For generic drug manufacturers offering ndirect substitutes or alternatives to  opioids, pricing has been an effective tool in grabbing market share. Specialty  pharmaceutical companies will feel competitive and regulatory pressures, making  strategic deals and drug development important components of their strategy.

316,"   By Sijia Jiang | HONG KONG  HONG KONG Alibaba Group Holdings' finance arm on Wednesday demonstrated a payment service that will allow virtual reality shoppers to pay for things in future just by nodding their heads.VR Pay, the new payment system, is part of Alibaba's efforts to capitalize on the latest technology in online shopping. In 2015, for example, it introduced a facial recognition technology for Alipay mobile payments service advertised as ""pay with a selfie"". The VR payment technology means people using virtual reality goggles to browse virtual reality shopping malls will be able pay for purchases without taking off the goggles. They can just nod or look instead. Lin Feng, who is in charge of Ant Financial's incubator F Lab that has been developing the payment service over the past few months, told Reuters: ""It is very boring to have to take off your goggles for payment. With this, you will never need to take out your phone."" User identity can be verified on VR Pay via account logins on connected devices or via voice print technology that recognizes each person's unique voice. Lin said this was the most convenient method in a VR setting compared with other biometric recognition technologies.    But passwords will still be needed for authentication, which the user can also enter with head movements, touch, or by staring at a point on virtual display for longer than 1.5 seconds, he said. VR Pay is expected to be ready for commercial launch by the end of this year.  Ant Financial said its new VR-based payment infrastructure can make VR ""a tool rather than just a toy"" by connecting various VR goggle makers and app developers to the Alipay payments platform. Ant Financial Services Group, which was demonstrating VR Pay in Shenzhen on Wednesday, operates China's largest online payments service Alipay with more than 450 million daily users. In September, it bought U.S.company EyeVerify, a maker of optical verification technology used by U.S. banks including Wells Fargo. (Reporting by Sijia Jiang.

322,"   By Caroline Humer and Ankur Banerjee  U.S. health insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) warned on Thursday that losses from its Obamacare individual insurance plans will likely continue despite pulling out of the exchanges in most states, creating uncertainty for next year's earnings.Chief Executive Officer Mark Bertolini said the earliest the health insurer might return to the exchanges is 2019, more likely 2020, and then only if operations improve. Shares fell 1 percent to $109.81.The CEO's comments came during a conference call to discuss third-quarter earnings and revenue, both of which beat analysts' expectations.Aetna said in August it will reduce participation in  individual insurance on government-run online marketplaces to four states from the current 15 states due to financial losses. It will continue to sell plans on the exchanges.Bertolini's comments came two days after the U.S. government said premium rates for Obamacare plans would increase by 25 percent, on average, in 2017, reflecting higher medical costs of insuring members. Bertolini said two problems are the risk adjustment calculation that smooths out the costs of sick patients and the number of people enrolled in the program.  ""Until that mechanism changes, or until the pool substantively changes, we're going to find ourselves in a premium spiral that's going to continue to drive rates up,"" Bertolini said.The government estimates 2017 enrollment to rise 1 million about 11.4 million people.

338,"   By Diane Bartz | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON A U.S. Justice Department attorney told a federal judge on Monday that health insurer Aetna Inc's planned acquisition of Humana Inc would break antitrust law by reducing competition in Medicare Advantage and Obamacare exchange businesses, kicking off a trial expected to last weeks.The Justice Department filed a lawsuit in July asking the court to stop Aetna's $34 billion deal for Humana, arguing it would lead to higher prices for seniors and the disabled on Medicare and for people who use the individual insurance program created under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. Aetna defended the deal on Monday, arguing that Medicare Advantage competes with the government's traditional Medicare program for elderly or disabled patients. It also said that it plans to stay out of the Obamacare exchanges in the near future.Both programs, as well as antitrust enforcement, could face changes under Republican President-elect Donald Trump.Justice Department lawyer Craig Conrath told Judge John Bates of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that traditional government-managed Medicare does not compete with Medicare Advantage, which is run by insurers. A witness called by the government, Aetna executive Nancy Cocozza, president of Aetna's Medicare Business, was shown internal documents that appeared to show that Aetna considered Humana a major competitor but not original Medicare. The documents were not visible in the court.Shown one assessment of top competitors that did not have Medicare, Cocozza protested, ""These are MA (Medicare Advantage) competitors but there are others.""Conrath also said that Aetna's plan to largely exit the Obamacare exchanges in 2017 should be disregarded because the company could re-enter the market as soon as 2018 if it chooses. Conrath said written communications showed that Aetna left Obamacare because of the antitrust lawsuit. Aetna has said it would not return to the exchanges until 2019 at the earliest.Share prices of both companies dropped Monday. Humana closed down 2.2 percent at $208.83 while Aetna was down 3 percent at $129.45.Aetna attorney John Majoras argued that traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage did compete, citing a U.S. government website. There could soon be more competition, he said, noting ""entry has been common and it has been widespread."" Majoras also argued that the Obamacare exchanges were unprofitable and said that was the real reason the company planned to drop out of 11 of the 15 states where they are on the exchanges. ""The result to Aetna has been mounting losses,"" Majoras said. ""Humana's losses were actually even a bit worse.""The Justice Department filed another lawsuit in July to stop Anthem Inc's planned $45 billion purchase of Cigna Corp. That trial is underway in the same courthouse. The trials will be over before Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. He has pledged to repeal and replace Obamacare and has said Medicare should be modernized.   Humana is the second largest Medicare Advantage insurer while Aetna is the fourth, and the two compete in more than 600 counties, the government said in its complaint.
