0,"  May 13 Public Service Enterprise Group Inc  said on Tuesday it will extend the ongoing refuelling outage at its 1,160-megawatt Unit 2 at the Salem nuclear power plant in New Jersey.The company will use the extra time to inspect all four of the plant's reactor coolant pumps and, if necessary, make repairs.""During the ongoing refuelling outage for Salem Unit 2, a bolting issue was discovered with one of the four reactor coolant pumps that pump water through the reactor coolant system,"" company spokesman Joseph Delmar told Reuters in an email.He said there was no potential for damage to the reactor core or any threat to public health and safety.The company did not say how long it would extend the outage.When the unit shut around April 14 for refuelling, power traders guessed it would return about a month later in mid May.Now they figure the additional inspection could add a couple weeks onto the length of the outage because the company likely will have to remove the pump motors to perform the inspections.""There are huge shield plugs which need to be removed from the upper level of the containment floor and then they would need to use a large crane to remove the motors,"" one trader with experience at nuclear reactors said.Meanwhile, Salem 1 was operating at full capacity.  ---------------------------------------------------------- PLANT BACKGROUND/TIMELINE STATE:        New Jersey     COUNTY:       Salem            TOWN:         Salem along the Delaware River about 40 miles(60 km) south of Philadelphia            OPERATOR:     PSEG's PSEG Nuclear            OWNER(S):     - Salem 1 & 2 - PSEG (57.41 pct)- Exelon (42.59 pct) - Hope Creek  - PSEG (100 pct)            CAPACITY:     3,531 MW            UNIT(S):      - Hope Creek - 1,161-MW General Electric boilingwater reactor- Salem 1 - 1,174-MW Combustion Engineeringpressurized water reactor- Salem 2 - 1,158-MW Combustion Engineering pressurized water reactor- 38 MW Salem 3 - gas turbine           FUEL:         Nuclear; Kerosene (Unit 3)            DISPATCH:     Baseload            COST:         Salem 1 and 2 - $1.3 billionHope Creek - $4.3 billion.

1,"   By Scott DiSavino  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc plans to spend about $3.5 billion over the next five years to expand and modernize its U.S. power plant fleet to remain competitive in the current low natural gas price environment.""The gas industry has done a remarkable job of finding more fuel over the past several years, but that has depressed both gas and power prices. We have to continue modernizing our fleet to keep our plants competitive,"" said Shahid Malik, president of PSEG Energy Resources and Trade.Most of the company's generation investments will go into building new gas plants at Sewaren in New Jersey and Keys in Maryland, adding capacity at nuclear reactors and upgrading existing gas units, Malik said.Rapid growth in gas production in the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia from 1.8 billion cubic feet per day five years ago to 16.5 bcfd now has cut the region's gas prices down to just $1.57 per million British thermal units this year. That is down from a five-year (2010-2014) average of $3.66.With gas so cheap, generators like PSEG are burning more of the fuel and less coal to produce electricity, making it tough for other fuels to compete. ""The markets don't care if electricity comes from solar, gas or nuclear. They buy based on price and since gas is the lowest-cost fuel, it is replacing coal, oil and even some smaller nuclear plants,"" Malik said.PSEG, which still gets most of its power from nuclear, now generates up to 40 percent of the rest from gas plants and just about 10 percent from coal. That is a switch from a few years ago, when coal produced 30 percent of PSEG's power, and gas as little as 20 percent.""You are seeing the slow demise of the coal industry in the United States. It started off due to environmental reasons and is now being pushed downhill by low-cost gas,"" Malik said.PSEG, however, continues to believe in a diversified fleet, including a mix of nuclear, coal, gas and renewables, and has no plans to shut coal plants at this time. ""The coal plants are not making as much money as they had in the past, but do still produce some income,"" Malik said. He noted that some coal units have become peaking plants that run only when demand is very high and they are needed to maintain grid reliability.

2,"   By Scott DiSavino  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc, New Jersey's biggest power company, plans to spend $1.6 billion over five years to expand its natural gas and other power plants to take advantage of cheap prices from swollen gas supplies.""We have been talking about this low gas-price environment for years. We are building new combined-cycle gas units, while also making investments in existing plants to get more out of them,"" William Levis, president and chief operating officer of PSEG Power told Reuters.While PSEG's investments regularly include capital for upgrading and expanding existing units, the combined-cycle plants, planned in its 2015-2019 budgets, would be the first significant new generators built in a decade or so.Combined-cycle facilities are the most efficient gas-fired power plants because they use both gas and steam turbines to get more electricity out of the same fuel than a simple-cycle plant. PSEG is building one in Maryland and another in New Jersey and hopes to build a third in Connecticut, Levis said.""One of the biggest changes we have seen with the collapse in gas prices is that our combined-cycle plants have become one of the workhorses of our fleet,"" Levis said, noting some of the combined-cycle units were running about 70 percent of the time up from just about 20 percent a decade ago. Use of gas as fuel for electricity accelerated over the past decade with the increase in production from shale formations like the Marcellus in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.That increase in output pushed U.S. gas prices down to $2.61 per million British thermal units last year, the lowest level since 1999.  ""We have this dash to gas, which has been good for our country in many ways, creating jobs, lowering energy costs, cleaner for the environment, but we still believe in a diversified fuel supply,"" Levis said, noting PSEG owns nuclear, gas, coal and renewable power plants.Power companies in 2015 may have burned more gas than coal to produce power for the first time in history as generators retired a record number of coal units because weak gas and power prices made it uneconomic to upgrade older coal units to meet stricter federal environmental rules.Levis said PSEG has an agreement in principle to shut its 383-megawatt coal plant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 2021, the only coal plant in the state. Before doing that, PSEG wants to first get approval to build a new gas plant at the site. He said the company hopes to build the new combined-cycle  plant with a capacity of around 500 MW in Bridgeport by the summer of 2019. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes.Levis said PSEG has no immediate plans to shut its other coal plants. ""We will run them as long as we make money at them.""
