0,"  * Biotech shares slip for second day this week* Consumer confidence hits six-year high in March* Walgreen, McCormick shares rally after results* Dow up 0.3 pct; S&P 500 up 0.2 pct; Nasdaq off 0.2 pct   (Updates to midday)By Angela MoonNEW YORK, March 25 U.S. stocks sharply trimmed gains by midday on Tuesday as many of the market's momentum stocks turned negative.Offsetting a strong reading on consumer confidence that had boosted the market earlier, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index led the market lower for a second day this week. The Nasdaq Biotechnology Index fell 1.2 percent after rising more than 2 percent earlier. Selling pressure has also intensified of late as valuations reach levels not seen in almost a decade. The forward price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 recently hit its highest since early 2005, and is trading above the historical median, according to Thomson Reuters IBES data.So-called momentum stocks fell sharply near midday, including Netflix, down 3 percent at $367.50, and First Solar Inc, down 4 percent at $70.93. Netflix has declined for 14 of the past 15 sessions, falling almost 19 percent over that stretch.Biotech shares slipped, including Regeneron Pharma , down 1.3 percent at $302.78, and Biogen Idec, down 2.2 percent at $305.84.""Anecdotally, it does seem that when there's upside momentum, people jump into risky names, and then they bail fairly quickly when they have concerns,"" said Randy Frederick, managing director of active trading for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. ""I wouldn't say that the market at large is at risk of falling just because these did. There's nothing on the S&P that would make people concerned from a technical perspective. We're well above the 50-day moving average and haven't touched the 200-day in years. So far, fund flows indicate that people aren't leaving equities.""The Dow Jones industrial average was up 49.55 points, or 0.30 percent, at 16,326.24. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index   was up 3.30 points, or 0.18 percent, at 1,860.74. The Nasdaq Composite Index  was down 6.83 points, or 0.16 percent, at 4,219.55.The Dow had traded at an intraday high of 16,404.46, while the S&P 500 had climbed as high as 1,871.87 earlier in the session and the Nasdaq had hit a session high at 4,274.321.. The CBOE Volatility Index or VIX, Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, was down 1.1 percent at 14.92.Data showed consumer confidence rose more than expected in March, climbing to its highest level since January 2008. The report was the latest in a string of positive reads on the U.S. economy that supported theories that softness early this year was related to bad weather and not weakening fundamentals.Investors continued to watch global issues cautiously. On Monday, major stock indexes fell on concerns that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate, pushing traders to take profits in such high-flying sectors as biotech and Internet shares. Those names rebounded on Tuesday, with some of Monday's biggest decliners topping the list of advancing S&P 500 names.In the latest on the housing market, U.S. single-family home prices rose slightly more than expected in January, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas, while new home sales fell more than expected in February.In company news, Walt Disney Co agreed to buy Maker Studios, one of YouTube's largest networks, for $500 million, though the price tag could rise to $950 million if the company hits certain performance milestones. Shares of the Dow component slid 0.9 percent to $78.78.Shares of Carnival Corp slumped 5.3 percent to $37.91 as one of the S&P 500's biggest decliners after the cruise operator warned that it might post a loss in its current quarter.

1,"  * Biotech shares rise, rebounding after recent losses* Consumer confidence hits six-year high in March* Walgreen, McCormick shares rally after results* Indexes up: Dow 0.6 pct, S&P 0.5 pct, Nasdaq 0.7 pct   (Updates to open, adds analyst comment and data)By Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, March 25 U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as many of the market's biggest trading favorites regained their momentum and a strong read on consumer confidence boosted optimism about economic conditions.Consumer confidence rose more than expected in March, climbing to its highest level since January 2008. The report was the latest in a string of positive reads on the economy that supported theories that softness early this year was related to bad weather and not weakening fundamentals.Investors continued to watch global issues cautiously. On Monday, major indexes fell on concerns that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate, pushing traders to take profits in such high-flying sectors as biotech and Internet shares. Those names rebounded on Tuesday, with some of Monday's biggest decliners topping the list of advancing S&P 500 names. Biotech shares snapped a four-day losing streak to rise 1.7 percent. Alexion Pharma rose 2.4 percent to $153.29, while Regeneron Pharma was up 2 percent at $312.41. Among Internet names, which have also been hit by accusations that they are overpriced, Facebook Inc added 2.1 percent to $64.97.The rebound in some so-called ""momentum"" names was an indication that while concerns persist about geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and slowing growth in China, investors are not so bearish on equities as to sell them wholesale. The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of investor anxiety, fell 5.6 percent and remains at historically low levels.""Investors become momentarily concerned about valuation, but that pullback was healthy, and we could see modest gains from here just because equities remain the most attractive place to be,"" said Kristina Hooper, head of portfolio strategies at Allianz Global Investors in New York, which has $475 billion in assets under management. ""Biotechs continue to look attractive since they offer a higher level of growth, and in face they look more attractive than they did because valuations improved in the selloff.""McCormick & Co and Walgreen Co were the S&P 500's two biggest gainers after reporting quarterly results. Both posted sales increases, but Walgreen said a slowdown in the introduction of higher-profit generic medicines cut into its gross profit margin.McCormick rose 5.7 percent to $71.43 while Walgreen added 4.5 percent to $67.24.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 94.93 points, or 0.58 percent, at 16,371.62. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  was up 9.83 points, or 0.53 percent, at 1,867.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 31.33 points, or 0.74 percent, at 4,257.71. The conflict over Ukraine continued with leaders of the Group of Seven nations warning Russia it faced further sanctions if Russian President Vladimir Putin took further action to destabilize Ukraine following the seizure of Crimea.While few U.S. companies have direct exposure to the region, market participants are concerned about the fallout from any escalation in what is already the biggest confrontation between the United States and Russia since the Cold War.Investors also continued to look to China, with expectations growing that the government would intervene to support its economy following a series of economic reports that imply the weakest growth in China since the global financial crisis.In the latest on the housing market, U.S. single-family home prices rose slightly more than expected in January, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas, while new home sales fell more than expected in February.In company news, Walt Disney Co agreed to buy Maker Studios, one of YouTube's largest networks, for $500 million, though the price tag could rise to $950 million if the company hits certain performance milestones. Shares of the Dow component dipped 0.3 percent to $79.25.Shares of Carnival Corp slumped 3.4 percent to $38.65 as the S&P 500's biggest decliner after the cruise operator warned that it might post a loss in its current quarter.

3,"  CHICAGO Illinois' ongoing budget battle led Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings on Wednesday to drop the rating on more than $3 billion of bonds issued for an expansion of Chicago's McCormick Place convention center.Without a state budget for the fiscal year that started July 1, the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, which issued the bonds, informed bondholders on Monday that no tax revenue has been appropriated and that a $20.8 million monthly debt service deposit was not sent to the bond trustee last month.To address the technical default, the Illinois Senate on Tuesday passed a bill allowing tax revenue earmarked to pay off the bonds to be transferred to the authority without a state appropriation until a fiscal 2016 state budget is enacted. The House may take up the measure next week.S&P downgraded the bonds by seven notches to BBB-plus from AAA. Analyst John Sugden said the rating will remain at BBB-plus and on a watch list for another possible downgrade despite the legislation. S&P said even though the bond trustee has enough funds to make the Dec. 15 debt service payment, the downgrade reflects its view that the bonds now constitute debt subject to state appropriation instead of special tax bonds. As a result, the rating was dropped to one notch below Illinois' A-minus rating, which is also on an S&P watch list for a possible downgrade. ""This event does not affect the state's (general obligation) rating but does underscore the fiscal challenges associated with the protracted budget stalemate,"" S&P said in a statement.Fitch said it downgraded the bonds to BBB-plus, from AA-minus.

4,"  (Adds Fitch rating)CHICAGO Aug 5 Illinois' ongoing budget battle led Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings on Wednesday to drop the rating on more than $3 billion of bonds issued for an expansion of Chicago's McCormick Place convention center.Without a state budget for the fiscal year that started July 1, the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, which issued the bonds, informed bondholders on Monday that no tax revenue has been appropriated and that a $20.8 million monthly debt service deposit was not sent to the bond trustee last month.To address the technical default, the Illinois Senate on Tuesday passed a bill allowing tax revenue earmarked to pay off the bonds to be transferred to the authority without a state appropriation until a fiscal 2016 state budget is enacted. The House may take up the measure next week. S&P downgraded the bonds by seven notches to BBB-plus from AAA. Analyst John Sugden said the rating will remain at BBB-plus and on a watch list for another possible downgrade despite the legislation.S&P said even though the bond trustee has enough funds to make the Dec. 15 debt service payment, the downgrade reflects its view that the bonds now constitute debt subject to state appropriation instead of special tax bonds. As a result, the rating was dropped to one notch below Illinois' A-minus rating, which is also on an S&P watch list for a possible downgrade. ""This event does not affect the state's (general obligation) rating but does underscore the fiscal challenges associated with the protracted budget stalemate,"" S&P said in a statement.Fitch said it downgraded the bonds to BBB-plus, from AA-minus.

22,"   By Martinne Geller and Freya Berry | LONDON  LONDON Two major shareholders in Premier Foods (PFD.L) urged it on Thursday to hold talks with U.S. suitor McCormick (MKC.N), after the British company formed an alliance with Japanese instant noodle maker Nissin Foods (2897.T).Premier Foods, home to familiar British brands including Mr Kipling cakes and Bisto gravy, has rebuffed two approaches from spices maker McCormick, saying its latest proposal of 60 pence per share worth 1.5 billion pounds ($2.1 billion), including debt and pension liabilities, ""significantly undervalued"" it. The British firm instead agreed a cooperation deal with Nissin that on Thursday also saw the Japanese company become Premier's largest shareholder. Nissin bought a 17.3 percent stake from private equity firm Warburg Pincus for 63 pence per share, or 90 million pounds ($127 million).However, Paulson & Co and Standard Life Investments, two other top shareholders, criticized Premier's board, questioning its objectivity and commitment to maximizing shareholder value.Paulson, which owns more than 7 percent of Premier, said the board appeared to be favoring Nissin to the detriment of other shareholders who were not offered the same premium paid by the Japanese firm, or other bidders that could be discouraged by Nissin's stake.""The company should fully engage with McCormick,"" Orkun Kilic of Paulson Europe said in a statement, adding McCormick, with its market value of $12 billion, was far better able to safeguard future pension obligations than Premier, which it said had a market capitalization of $650 million.David Cumming of Standard Life Investments, which also has a roughly 7 percent stake in Premier, called McCormick's proposal too low, but added the fund arm of insurer Standard Life (SL.L) was open to a bid at a higher level.Premier was not immediately available to comment on the shareholder statements, though earlier on Thursday it said it would consider improved proposals.  ""Should McCormick, or any other bona fide potential offeror, come forward with an improved proposal that better reflects the board's assessment of the company’s underlying value over the longer term, the Board would give such offer careful consideration,"" Premier said.Following the two rejections, McCormick said on Thursday it was willing to proceed with ""limited confirmatory due diligence"" that only comprised a review of pensions documentation, current trading and material contracts. It said it would be willing to consider increasing its proposal if justified following that review. EARNINGS BOOST The value of Premier Foods has been depressed by a high debt load and pension obligations following an acquisition spree, but it offers a range of mainstream grocery brands that are slow-growing but profitable.Premier shares, which soared 70 percent on Wednesday, closed down 3 percent at 52 pence in London.

23,"   By Martinne Geller and Freya Berry | LONDON  LONDON Two major shareholders in Premier Foods (PFD.L) urged it on Thursday to hold talks with U.S. suitor McCormick (MKC.N), after the British company formed an alliance with Japanese instant noodle maker Nissin Foods (2897.T).Premier Foods, home to familiar British brands including Mr Kipling cakes and Bisto gravy, has rebuffed two approaches from spices maker McCormick, saying its latest proposal of 60 pence per share worth 1.5 billion pounds ($2.1 billion), including debt and pension liabilities, ""significantly undervalued"" it. The British firm instead agreed a cooperation deal with Nissin that on Thursday also saw the Japanese company become Premier's largest shareholder. Nissin bought a 17.3 percent stake from private equity firm Warburg Pincus for 63 pence per share, or 90 million pounds ($127 million).However, Paulson & Co and Standard Life Investments, two other top shareholders, criticized Premier's board, questioning its objectivity and commitment to maximizing shareholder value.Paulson, which owns more than 7 percent of Premier, said the board appeared to be favoring Nissin to the detriment of other shareholders who were not offered the same premium paid by the Japanese firm, or other bidders that could be discouraged by Nissin's stake.""The company should fully engage with McCormick,"" Orkun Kilic of Paulson Europe said in a statement, adding McCormick, with its market value of $12 billion, was far better able to safeguard future pension obligations than Premier, which it said had a market capitalization of $650 million.David Cumming of Standard Life Investments, which also has a roughly 7 percent stake in Premier, called McCormick's proposal too low, but added the fund arm of insurer Standard Life (SL.L) was open to a bid at a higher level.Premier was not immediately available to comment on the shareholder statements, though earlier on Thursday it said it would consider improved proposals.  ""Should McCormick, or any other bona fide potential offeror, come forward with an improved proposal that better reflects the board's assessment of the company’s underlying value over the longer term, the Board would give such offer careful consideration,"" Premier said.Following the two rejections, McCormick said on Thursday it was willing to proceed with ""limited confirmatory due diligence"" that only comprised a review of pensions documentation, current trading and material contracts. It said it would be willing to consider increasing its proposal if justified following that review. EARNINGS BOOST The value of Premier Foods has been depressed by a high debt load and pension obligations following an acquisition spree, but it offers a range of mainstream grocery brands that are slow-growing but profitable.Premier shares, which soared 70 percent on Wednesday, closed down 3 percent at 52 pence in London. Shares of McCormick were up 0.5 percent at $96.35 in New York at 1921 GMT.""In the past, they've (McCormick) been pretty disciplined about what they're willing to pay and generally acquisitions have been accretive very quickly to their earnings,"" said Mark Hughes, director of investment research at Lafayette Investments in Ashton, Maryland.

24,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK There is nothing bland about betting on McCormick.The Maryland spice maker is preparing to report slowing first quarter earnings with its share price as high and expensive as it has ever been. Yet investors expect the company to hold its own on Wall Street, partly because of acquisitions.McCormick is due on Tuesday to report earnings for the quarter ended in February and analysts expect a gain of 69 cents per share compared to 70 cents a year earlier.The stock is up 12.6 percent so far this year, compared to a flat S&P 500 .SPX and a gain of 2.2 percent in the S&P 1500 food products index .SPCOMFDPR.McCormick stock trades at about 25 times its expected earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio of close to 20 among its food producer peers, according to Reuters data. That is its highest valuation ever but is well deserved, said Mark Hughes of Lafayette Investments in Ashton, Maryland, which has slightly more than 2 percent of its portfolio in McCormick.Hughes said the high price does not concern him and sees potential for the company to continue to grow, especially through acquisitions. ""They’re in a very steady business that’s growing nicely but acquisitions have always been a key component of their growth strategy,"" he said. McCormick is bidding for Premier Foods (PFD.L) but its sweetened offer was rejected by the British company last week. Two major Premier shareholders urged it on Thursday to talk with McCormick.""In the past they’ve been pretty disciplined about what they’re willing to pay and generally acquisitions have been accretive very quickly to their earnings,"" Hughes said.Since 2010 McCormick has acquired assets in India, Poland, China, the United States and Italy for about $850 million.  WORTH ITS SALT  McCormick's shares already have exceeded most analysts' expectations. Last week they hit a record of $96.46, more than 10 percent above the current median target of $87, according to Reuters data.About 6.1 percent of its stock is sold short, according to data released Thursday, among the largest in the food producers group of the S&P 500 .5SP302020 and above the 4.5 percent average for all the index's components.Short sellers borrow stock and sell it, and make money when they can buy it back at a lower price. Despite McCormick's high valuation, some shorts are keeping their distance.""It is overvalued, relatively high considering where food companies have been in the past years,"" said Brad Lamensdorf, a short sale specialist and co-manager of the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF (HDGE.P). However, he sees ""tremendous"" potential for the company as a takeover target.""I wouldn’t even understand why a short seller would want to short this stock.""He said McCormick's management is strong and ""there's nothing in here that makes me concerned about their operation.""The company is in a quiet period ahead of earnings and declined to comment for this story.With a market capitalization slightly above $12 billion, McCormick is smaller than most companies on the S&P 500 food products index, which includes Kraft Heinz (KHC.O), General Mills (GIS.N) and Kellogg (K.N), all with market caps above $25 billion.On average over the past eight earnings seasons the stock has moved 3 percent after reporting and current options activity shows little expectation of any post-earnings move to go far beyond that.

27,"   By Martinne Geller and Vidya L Nathan | LONDON  LONDON Britain's Premier Foods (PFD.L) agreed on Wednesday to hold talks with McCormick & Co (MKC.N) after the U.S. company raised its takeover proposal for a second time, pushing for a deal that would boost its stable of kitchen cupboard brands.McCormick raised its takeover proposal to 65 pence per share, aiming to break a stalemate after Premier refused its prior offers of 52 and 60 pence and instead agreed to an international cooperation deal with Japanese noodle maker Nissin (2897.T), sparking criticism from some Premier investors.  Nissin raised its stake in Premier to 19.9 percent, according to a regulatory filing on Wednesday, from 17.3 percent that it bought last week from private equity firm Warburg Pincus for 63 pence per share to become Premier's largest shareholder.The new proposal from McCormick values Premier's equity at 537 million pounds ($774 million). McCormick said the proposal represented an enterprise value of 1.51 billion pounds including debt and future pension liabilities.Premier said the proposal was still too low, but it was prepared for meetings to provide McCormick with the limited financial information it is seeking, to establish whether the U.S. firm would increase its offer to ""a recommendable level"".A combination would marry well-known British brands such as Mr Kipling cakes, Bisto gravies and Oxo seasonings with McCormick's spices, Lawry's seasonings and Thai Kitchen meals.  While many of the brands are complementary, the merger would also likely aim to boost profits by streamlining, a strategy at work in last year's creation of Kraft Heinz Co (KHC.O) and becoming increasingly important amid a global slowdown in sales of packaged foods as consumers seek fresher, healthier options.    ""GOOD COMPROMISE""  Shore Capital analysts urged Premier shareholders to accept the revised proposal, which is a little over double the stock's closing price on March 23, before the approach was made public.""We see 65p as a good compromise price, allowing Premier's management to highlight the extra value it has extracted from McCormick, whilst also offering shareholders the opportunity of a cash exit today at a reasonably full EBITDA (core earnings) valuation,"" they said in a research note.Premier's shares, which closed 4.4 percent higher at 60.25 pence on Wednesday, have been depressed by a large debt load and pension liabilities left over from an acquisition spree.  Chief Executive Gavin Darby has been working on a turnaround that has included selling assets and refinancing debt. Last week, Premier said it was working on a wider roll-out of its snack cakes, expanding some of its shelf-stable brands into higher-margin chilled categories and a cooperation deal with Japan's Nissin, which would extend its reach abroad.Premier's prior refusal to enter talks with McCormick led some of its major shareholders, including Paulson & Co and Standard Life Investments, to criticize the board.McCormick has until April 20 to make a firm offer under British takeover rules.

Germany's DAX gained 1.6 percent and the euro zone's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index rose 1.3 percent.The FTSEurofirst is still down around 7 percent since the start of 2016, however, on concerns about a China-led global economic slowdown. That threat was one reason Yellen said on Tuesday the Fed should proceed only cautiously to raise interest rates .Yellen's comments showed how efforts by the Fed and European Central Bank to keep rates low were hitting returns on bonds and cash, said Hampstead Capital hedge fund manager Lex Van Dam, and pushing investors towards the better returns from stocks.""Equity markets remain supported by the global central banks - the economy might not be in great shape, but with real rates in negative territory, there are not many other places to find a return,"" Van Dam said.Yellen's comments weakened the U.S. dollar on currency markets. That in turn supported the shares of mining and energy companies since a weaker dollar makes commodities cheaper for investors using other currencies. Steelmakers rose after Tata Steel said it wanted to leave the British market, sparking hopes of a European consolidation. Shares in ThyssenKrupp were up 8.3 percent, ArcelorMittal 3.6 percent and Outokumpu  6.5 percent.Metro jumped 11.5 percent after it proposed splitting itself in two, with its wholesale and food business transferred in one entity and consumer electronics remaining part of the existing company.Premier Foods rose 4.4 percent after the British food maker agreed to hold talks with McCormick & Co.
