2,"  (Adds market reaction, comments, CSX details and updates share movement)Jan 22 Norfolk Southern Corp on Wednesday reported a 24 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street's  expectations, as strong chemicals, construction materials and auto shipments more than offset a dip in coal volumes.Shares of the railroad company rose as much as 7 percent in  morning trading in New York.The railroad, which said it is planning to increase investments in its business  by 12 percent this year, said shipments of crude and higher automotive production helped boost traffic volume by 8 percent in the quarter. Revenue from coal fell 2 percent.Norfolk Southern said it worked on reigning in costs throughout the year. In the quarter, its operating ratio, or operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, was 69.4 percent, a 5 percent improvement over the same quarter in 2012, the company said. The ratio is considered an important measure of a railroad's health.For the year, the ratio improved 1 percent to 71.0 percent. At rival CSX Corp, by comparison, the ratio increased slightly to 71.1 percent. ""That tells me that Norfolk Southern basically took the same operating environment and did a better job of reining in expenses,"" said Houston-based individual investor Ray Merola.Merola said the market reaction to Norfolk Southern's results was more a result of the better operating ratio than revenue and profit gains, because an improvement in costs is an indication of a well run company. For the fourth quarter, Norfolk Southern earned $513 million or $1.64 a share, up from the $413 million, or $1.30 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.Revenue totaled $2.9 billion, an increase of 7 percent.Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $1.50 a share  on revenue of $2.85 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Norfolk Southern operates 20,000 route miles in 22 states and the District of Columbia.Weak coal shipment volumes have been a problem for Norfolk Southern and CSX, as the shift to natural gas has caused utility coal stockpiles to surge as demand for coal from power producers declined. Both railroads have been looking at rising demand for shipments of chemicals, autos and agricultural products to make up for the weakness in coal.Earlier in the month, CSX posted a  fourth-quarter profit that fell short of Wall Street's estimates. CSX is also more exposed to coal than is Norfolk Southern. Coal shipments make up 25 percent of CSX's overall shipments. At Norfolk Southern, they account for around 20 percent.Shares of the company were up 5 percent at $93.15 on Wednesday at mid-day.

4,"   By Robert Gibbons and Elizabeth Dilts | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A 120-car Norfolk Southern Corp train carrying heavy Canadian crude oil derailed and spilled in western Pennsylvania on Thursday, adding to a string of recent accidents that have prompted calls for stronger safety standards.There were no reports of injury or fire after 21 tank cars came off the track and crashed into a nearby industrial building at a bend by the Kiskiminetas River in the town of Vandergrift.Nineteen of the derailed cars were carrying oil, four of which spilled between 3,000 and 4,000 gallons of oil, Norfolk Southern said. The leaks have since been plugged. The two other derailed tank cars held liquefied petroleum gas.The train, which originated in Chicago, was destined for an asphalt plant in Paulsboro, New Jersey, owned by NuStar, a NuStar spokeswoman said.The clean-up was under way on Thursday as a heavy winter storm gathered pace, leaving about 4 inches of snow on the ground by midday Thursday. An investigator from the Federal Railroad Administration was en route to the scene, the railroad regulator said.""I heard a strange noise, a hollow, screeching sound,"" said Ray Cochran, who watched the train derail from his home on a hill above the tracks. ""I looked out the window and saw three or four tankers turn over and one of them ran into the building."" The train, which was also carrying food products, crashed into a track-side building owned by MSI Corporation that makes metal products.All employees had been accounted for, said Sandy Smythe, a public information officer with Westmoreland County's public safety department, which includes Vandergrift borough.MSI declined to comment. Thursday's accident is the latest in a spate of crude oil train derailments that has prompted calls for more stringent rules regulating crude by rail, shipments of which have soared in recent years as pipelines fail to keep up with growing supply.It comes ahead of a Senate hearing concerning the safety of transporting crude by rail, which has become a major political issue as the incidents pile up. The hearing was scheduled for Thursday, but was delayed by the snow.Thursday's accident was the second in less than a month in Pennsylvania. A train hauling crude on a CSX Corp railroad jumped the tracks and nearly toppled over a bridge in Philadelphia on January 20. There were no injuries or fire in that incident. A train carrying Bakken oil from North Dakota last July derailed and exploded in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, killing 47 people and decimating much of the small town.U.S. and Canadian railroad companies, tank car owners and regulators are investigating ways to transport crude on the rails more safely.

U.S. railroads had been hit by falling demand for coal through last year, but demand for thermal coal is expected to recover in the United States as power producers switch back to coal due to a recent run-up in natural gas prices.Rivals Union Pacific Corp and Kansas City Southern , which last week reported strong results for the same quarter, indicated that demand for coal was on an upswing.Norfolk Southern, the largest rail shipper of auto products in North America, said revenue from its automotive business dropped 7 percent. A severe winter hit auto demand in the first two months of the year and also affected shipments. Union Pacific warned in January that the weather was causing delays of up to 48 hours.""Following the extreme winter weather across the U.S. rail network, which impacted first-quarter results, we are seeing a rebound in shipments across all of our business,"" Norfolk Chief Executive Wick Moorman said. Norfolk Southern's net income fell to $368 million, or $1.17 per share, in the first quarter, from $450 million, or $1.41 per share, a year earlier.Net income in the prior-year quarter included a $60 million gain from a land sale.Railway operating revenue dropped 1.8 percent to $2.69 billion.The Norfolk, Virginia-based company's shares closed at $96.92 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.The company's stock has gained about 28 percent in the past 12 months, beating a 24 percent rise in the S&P 500 railroads index.

16,"  Norfolk Southern Corp said it would require its customers to give the railroad company legal protection against damage caused by explosions or leakage of hazardous materials carried in older tank cars.The company said in a notification to its customers that the legal protection would cover losses, damages, court costs, and costs of environmental cleanup and remediation, emergency response and evacuations, judgments, fines and penalties. (bit.ly/TnNxGT)Norfolk Southern said the legal protection, which applies to older DOT-111 tank cars built before late 2011, would take effect on July 15.The company also said the legal protection would cover the company, its parent, subsidiary and affiliated companies and its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents. A series of accidents on rail tank cars carrying crude oil has put the workhorses of the oil industry under scrutiny, and U.S. and Canadian regulators are carving out new rules on how to build them. In April, Canadian authorities ordered the phase-out of older rail cars, partly in response to the explosion and fire on a train carrying Bakken crude that killed 47 people in Lac-Megantic, Quebec, last July.

25,"  (Recasts lead, adds CEO comments on possible rail mergers)By Nick CareyCHICAGO Oct 22 No. 4 U.S. railroad Norfolk Southern Corp's chief executive said on Wednesday that mergers between major railroads in the United States face too many regulatory hurdles and cause too many problems to be worthwhile at this point.""Historically they (large mergers) have led to service problems for some period of time,"" Wick Moorman told analysts in a conference call after the company reported quarterly results. ""I just don't think they make sense at this particular time.""Moorman also said the Surface Transportation Board (STB), the top U.S. rail regulator, would ""not be too receptive"" to any proposed merger. A recent bid by No. 2 Canadian railroad Canadian Pacific Railway for No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp had fueled speculation that Norfolk Southern could be next on the block if a deal went through. Canadian Pacific announced this week that talks with CSX had failed.Analysts had predicted that getting a merger approved between the railroads, as Canadian Pacific has a large U.S. rail network already, would face tough scrutiny by the STB.Norfolk Southern reported a higher quarterly profit on Wednesday as the growing economy boosted freight volumes on its network, but it fell short of Wall Street analyst forecasts. Rail customers have complained this year of delays and service problems. The delays prompted the STB to issue a requirement earlier this month that all major railroads provide more detailed weekly reports on their performance.Norfolk Southern posted strong revenue growth of 12 percent in its automotive business and 10 percent in its intermodal freight, which reflect rising demand for cars and consumer goods. The company's operating ratio, or operating revenues as a percentage of revenue, improved nearly 3 percentage points to 67 percent from 69.9 percent last year. A railroad's operating ratio is seen as a key measure of performance by analysts.Norfolk, Virginia-based Norfolk Southern reported earnings per share on Wednesday of $1.79, up 17 percent from the $1.53 it reported for the same quarter in 2013. Analysts had on average expected earnings per share for the third quarter of $1.83.The company reported revenue for the quarter of $3.02 billion, up 7 percent from same period the previous year. That was slightly below analyst expectations of $3.07 billion.Norfolk Southern shares were down nearly 0.9 percent at $108.92 in morning trading.

27,"  (Adds CEO comments on economy, strong dollar, updates stock price)By Nick CareyCHICAGO Jan 26 Norfolk Southern Corp, the No. 4 U.S. railroad, expects a solid U.S. economy to boost its business in 2015 but said on Monday it was too early to gauge the overall impact of lower energy prices.""We feel good about the state of the economy,"" Chief Executive Officer Wick Moorman told Reuters after the company reported fourth-quarter earning that largely met market expectations. ""But what many people are trying to understand is the impact of lower oil prices.""Moorman said cheap oil should boost consumer spending, but the impact on crude oil shipments by rail was unclear. The strengthening U.S. housing market should also mean more lumber and other construction-related shipments. Norfolk Southern's fourth-quarter profit was hurt by a 15 percent drop in coal revenue. A weak global export market and fewer shipments of coal to utilities led to a 6 percent decrease in freight volumes.CEO Moorman said coal was unlikely to rebound in the near future, in part because of the strong U.S. dollar.The Norfolk, Virginia-based company said gains in its intermodal, or consumer goods shipments and its merchandise segment that includes chemical and agricultural goods, largely offset the fall in coal revenue. Overall, freight volumes on the railroad were up 4 percent during the quarter.Norfolk Southern reported fourth-quarter net income of $511 million, down from $513 million a year earlier. Earnings per share were flat at $1.64. Analysts expected $1.63.Revenue also remained flat at $2.9 billion and came in below analysts' expectations of $2.94 billion.The company also received a boost from falling oil prices. Its fuel bill for the quarter fell nearly 14 percent to $347 million from $403 million.In mid-day trading, Norfolk Southern shares were up 1.7 percent at $106.55.

CSX, the third largest U.S. railroad, on Wednesday cut its forecast for 2015 earnings-per-share growth to a mid-to-high single-digit percentage range from double digits. Chief Executive Officer Michael Ward told Reuters the reduced outlook reflected the impact of the strong dollar, low oil prices and the weak coal market. CSX on Tuesday reported a profit that met analysts' expectations, in part because of $105 million in surcharges from customers that failed to meet minimum contractual freight volumes.  ""The strength of the dollar did hurt us in the first quarter,"" Ward said. ""It's a mixed bag. It hurts some of our customers, but it's good for consumers and our customers who serve those consumers.""Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX's coal volumes fell 1 percent in the first quarter as the strong dollar forced a 7 percent drop in exports of the fuel, which also suffered from competition from low-priced natural gas. The company said its domestic coal business could fall 5 percent in 2015. CSX also expects the strong dollar to hurt its U.S. steel-producing customers because of rising cheap imports.  The railroad said crude by rail shipments, a profitable business plagued by uncertainty amid low oil prices, should remain flat throughout 2015.Earlier this week, Norfolk Southern, the fourth-largest U.S. railroad, estimated first-quarter earnings at $1.00 a share, 15 percent below last year and below analysts' expectations of $1.25. The Norfolk, Virginia-based company said revenue was down 5 percent. Norfolk Southern said severe winter weather hurt results, a factor CSX also highlighted, as did increased training costs as it scrambles to meet demand. But Norfolk Southern blamed the strong dollar and low natural gas for the dent in its coal business. ""Coal remains challenging across the board,"" President Jim Squire said in a conference call on Tuesday. However, S&P Capital IQ Equity Research Director Jim Corridore said the growing U.S. economy and improving efficiency should help mitigate the impact of cheap oil and the strong dollar on CSX and Norfolk Southern.

43,"  CHICAGO U.S. railroad Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) on Monday reported a lower quarterly net profit as coal freight shipments and fuel surcharge revenue fell, and said coal would continue to weigh on results this year.Like other major railroads, the Norfolk, Virginia-based railroad has seen coal shipments drop off as power plants shift to burning cheaper natural gas amid lower energy prices. The strong U.S. dollar has also hurt exports as American producers have found it harder to compete against coal mined overseas.Coal revenue at America's fourth-largest railroad in the second quarter slumped 33 percent to $453 million from $672 million. Coal shipments to utilities fell 23 percent in the quarter, while export coal shipments dropped 38 percent.During a conference call with analysts, executives said that largely due to lower coal volumes, the company expected revenue in the second half of the year to be lower compared with 2014. Norfolk Southern reported second-quarter net income of $433 million, or $1.41 per share, down 23 percent from $562 million, or $1.79 per share, a year earlier.Analysts had on average expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.42.The company reported revenue of $2.7 billion, down from $3 billion a year earlier and below analyst expectations of $2.79 billion. The company said falling fuel surcharges helped drive revenue down. ""While we face short-term pressure... as we clear fuel surcharge revenue and coal headwinds, Norfolk Southern is well positioned to continue improving service,"" Chief Executive James Squires said in a statement. While the company's fuel surcharges dropped, it also faced a sharply reduced fuel bill thanks to lower oil prices.

44,"  (Adds company comment, stock price, background)CHICAGO, July 27 U.S. railroad Norfolk Southern Corp on Monday reported a lower quarterly net profit as coal freight shipments and fuel surcharge revenue fell, and said coal would continue to weigh on results this year.Like other major railroads, the Norfolk, Virginia-based railroad has seen coal shipments drop off as power plants shift to burning cheaper natural gas amid lower energy prices.The strong U.S. dollar has also hurt exports as American producers have found it harder to compete against coal mined overseas.Coal revenue at America's fourth-largest railroad in the second quarter slumped 33 percent to $453 million from $672 million. Coal shipments to utilities fell 23 percent in the quarter, while export coal shipments dropped 38 percent. During a conference call with analysts, executives said that largely due to lower coal volumes, the company expected revenue in the second half of the year to be lower compared with 2014.Norfolk Southern reported second-quarter net income of $433 million, or $1.41 per share, down 23 percent from $562 million, or $1.79 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.42.The company reported revenue of $2.7 billion, down from $3 billion a year earlier and below analyst expectations of $2.79 billion. The company said falling fuel surcharges helped drive revenue down. ""While we face short-term pressure... as we clear fuel surcharge revenue and coal headwinds, Norfolk Southern is well positioned to continue improving service,"" Chief Executive James Squires said in a statement.While the company's fuel surcharges dropped, it also faced a sharply reduced fuel bill thanks to lower oil prices.Norfolk Southern's fuel bill fell nearly 38 percent to $255 million from $408 million in the second quarter of 2014.In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Norfolk Southern shares were up 1.8 percent at $84.46.

51,"  * Canadian dollar at C$1.3286 or 75.27 U.S. cents     * Bond prices higher across the maturity curve      By Fergal Smith     TORONTO, Nov 10 The Canadian dollar was slightly weaker against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, as crude oil prices slipped and weak Chinese inflation data fed concern about the global growth outlook.     At 8:49 a.m. ET (1349 GMT), the Canadian dollar was trading at C$1.3286 to the greenback, or 75.27 U.S. cents, slightly weaker than the Bank of Canada's official close of C$1.3275, or 75.33 U.S. cents on Monday.     The currency's strongest level of the session was C$1.3250, while its weakest level was C$1.3290, trading in a tight range. The bond market closes early ahead of Wednesday's national  Remembrance Day holiday.     U.S. stock index futures traded lower as investors worried about the potential for slower global growth in tandem with the start of Federal Reserve policy tightening as soon as December.       China's consumer price index inflation cooled more than anticipated in October, slowing to +1.3 year on year. It followed disappointing trade data over the weekend.      U.S. crude prices gave up earlier gains and slipped 0.11 percent to $43.82 a barrel, while Brent crude eased  0.15 percent to $47.12.      Medium term investors will also take note of a potential acquisition by Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd of U.S. peer Norfolk Southern Corp, after news of preliminary merger talks emerged on Monday.      Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins will deliver introductory remarks for David Dodge, former Bank of Canada Governor, and of George Akerlof, Professor at Georgetown University at an event in Toronto at 11:55 a.m. ET (1655 GMT), although the remarks will not be published and there is no press conference scheduled.     The market will also be looking ahead to comments from Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans, speaking after the close. Evans is seen by many in the market as a dove, so any pointer to a December rate hike may carry meaningful weight for the market.      Canadian government bond prices were higher across the maturity curve, with the two-year price up 2.5 Canadian cents to yield 0.66 percent and the benchmark 10-year  rising 1 Canadian cent to yield 1.717 percent.     The Canada-U.S. two-year bond spread was unchanged at -21.4 basis points, while the 10-year spread was 0.5 of a basis point narrower at -61.8 basis points.

54,"  (Adds regulatory details; updates shares)Nov 18 Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd said its proposed $28.4 billion acquisition of U.S. railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corp would help the combined company to save at least $1.8 billion annually.The combined company will also have substantial tax benefits, Canadian Pacific said in a letter it sent to Norfolk on Tuesday.Canadian Pacific made the letter public on Wednesday after Norfolk all but rejected the offer, calling it ""low-premium"" and warning of significant regulatory hurdles.The takeover proposal ""may be the first step on a journey that could see the Canadian carrier eventually going directly to Norfolk's shareholders before facing a long and drawn out regulatory process,"" Cowen and Co said in a note on Wednesday.The brokerage added that a rejection by Norfolk's board is likely ""a foregone conclusion,"" and that this could lead Canadian Pacific to sweeten the offer a bit.Because of a quirk in U.S. law, rail mergers are not reviewed by the U.S. Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission but by the Surface Transportation Board (STB). The freight industry underwent a rapid consolidation between 1980 and 2000, when the STB forced Canadian National Railway Co  and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp to abandon a deal while it re-wrote merger rules.Under the rules, which came into effect in 2001, the government doesn't have to prove that a merger is anti-competitive. Instead, the companies have to show that the deal is in public interest.But, given the previous consolidation, the top four rail shippers have some 90 percent of freight traffic, says Seth Bloom, a veteran of the Justice Department. ""The STB has historically been feckless but this latest merger is a real test for them,"" he said.Canadian Pacific routes are just north and south of the U.S.-Canada border and generally run east to west, while Norfolk Southern is up and down the east coast of the United States. They overlap primarily just south and east of the Great Lakes.One group critical of railroads is the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA), which has complained that its more remote members are at the mercy of a single shipper to deliver coal and face higher prices as a result. ""We are concerned about the merger and the potential negative impact on pricing and access,"" said Tracy Warren, spokeswoman for the NRECA.Canadian Pacific also said in the letter it had secured financing commitment of $14.2 billion from JP Morgan Securities.Canadian Pacific's shares closed up 5.6 percent at C$194.94 in Toronto, while Norfolk's stock ended up about 6.4 percent at $92.49 in New York.(Reporting by Amrutha Gayathri in Bengaluru and Diane Bartz in Washington; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Sriraj Kalluvila)",2015-11-18,NSC,"Wed Nov 18, 2015 | 4:45pm EST",UPDATE 2-CP Rail touts $1.8 bln savings from Norfolk deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/norfolk-southern-ma-cp-idUSL3N13D58M20151118?type=companyNews

56,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  U.S. railroad operator Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) all but rejected a $28.4 billion acquisition offer by Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) on Tuesday, calling it ""low-premium"" and warning it would face significant regulatory hurdles.While Norfolk Southern said it would carefully evaluate the offer, its sour response represents a setback to Canadian Pacific as well as its largest shareholder, William Ackman's activist hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management LP. Ackman, a big advocate of consolidation in the North American railway sector, recruited Hunter Harrison, who had previously been chief executive officer of Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO), as CEO of Canadian Pacific in 2012.In a statement earlier on Tuesday announcing its offer to Norfolk Southern, Canadian Pacific argued that the combined railroad would offer unparalleled customer service and competitive rates for shippers, and that it would satisfy the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) and Canadian regulators.The STB has a public interest test when considering whether to approve mergers, so a deal would not only have to address antitrust concerns but also result in improved service, economic efficiencies and public safety for those using the railways.Yet not only has Canadian Pacific failed to convince Norfolk Southern that the merger could receive regulatory clearance, it has offered no protection for Norfolk Southern shareholders in the event the deal would be blocked, according to a source who asked not to be identified because details of the discussions are not public.The first time Canadian Pacific contacted Norfolk Southern about the deal was after a Bloomberg News report on Nov. 9 that cited people familiar with the matter who said the two companies had held early-stage merger talks, the Reuters source added. Norfolk Southern Chief Executive James Squires subsequently met with Harrison in Florida last week to discuss the potential merger, according the source. Squires told Harrison he viewed the regulatory obstacles as insurmountable and that Norfolk Southern had a plan of its own to drive shareholder value, the source added. Canadian Pacific is offering Norfolk Southern shareholders $46.72 in cash and 0.348 Canadian Pacific shares for every Norfolk Southern share they own, Norfolk Southern said in its statement.That works out to about $94.94, a 9 percent premium to Norfolk Southern, based on both stocks' Tuesday close.  REGULATORY RISK Regulators have been skeptical of North American railway  mergers for years. Canadian National Railway Co's (CNR.TO) bid to buy Warren Buffett-owned Burlington Northern Santa Fe was blocked by U.S. antitrust authorities in 1999-2000.More recently, Canadian Pacific's merger talks with CSX Corp CSX.N, which also owns a large network across the eastern United States, also failed last year. Norfolk Southern operates 20,000 route miles in 22 states, mostly in Eastern United States, while Canadian Pacific transports to eight major ports in the United States and Canada, including Vancouver and Montreal.East- and west-based North American railways meet in Chicago and hand off cargo, a process that can take days. A deal with Norfolk Southern would improve congestion around Chicago, Canadian Pacific said in its statement.U.S. railroad stocks have dropped sharply this year, hurt by a fall in high-margin coal shipments and weak oil prices.Up to Tuesday's close, Canadian Pacific's shares had fallen nearly 33 percent this year, while Norfolk Southern's stock had lost about 24 percent. Canadian Pacific has a market value of $21.15 billion ($15.89 billion).Ackman is currently under pressure because of heavy losses in another Canadian company, Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO), whose shares have plunged more than two-thirds since early August over concerns about its financial practices and drug pricing.

58,"   By Ludwig Burger | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Syngenta SYNN.VX and other major seeds and crop chemicals companies are intensively discussing tie-ups, the Financial Times quoted the Swiss firm's chairman as saying on Wednesday, adding to a chorus of voices predicting a sector shake-up.Conversations among the leading players in the industry are ""extremely active"", the newspaper quoted Michel Demare as saying in an interview.""We are all convinced that (the sector) will look quite different in six months.""U.S. group Monsanto (MON.N), which withdrew a proposal to take over Syngenta in August, said on Tuesday its top executives were discussing whether they should acquire or merge with major rivals in the seed and agrochemical industries.The winning company in future will be one that can combine seeds and crop chemicals as part of an integrated offer, Demare said. Syngenta is the No.1 in crop chemicals with a 19 percent market share last year, just ahead of Bayer's (BAYGn.DE) CropScience division with 18 percent.Monsanto is the leader in seeds with a 26 percent market share, followed by Dupont Pioneer's (DD.N) 21 percent.    Demare's remarks echo those of Dupont interim Chief Executive Edward Breen, who said last month the U.S. group was talking to rivals about its agriculture business. That was less than a week after Dow Chemical (DOW.N) announced a strategic review of its farm chemicals and seeds unit, ranked number four and seven respectively, in these industries.The idea of marketing large offerings of seeds and pesticides in a bundle, and even adding computer and satellite-guided farming solutions on top, has been promoted by Monsanto, Syngenta and Bayer, among others.But the major crop chemicals players, Syngenta and Bayer, have ruled themselves out as easy targets of seed makers.  Syngenta fiercely rebuffed Monsanto's repeated overtures this year, while Bayer on Wednesday reaffirmed it would not part with its crop chemicals business, describing it as an ""integral part"" of the German healthcare group..While some analysts have said weak third-quarter demand from farmers, due to faltering crop and grain prices, has prompted the race to bulk up, Syngenta's Demare told the Financial Times that the current talks were fallout from Monsanto's failed move.""This is the result of the Monsanto approach for Syngenta, which for sure has shaken the whole industry ... It has created the huge activity in which everyone is speaking to each other.""

The STB has a public interest test when considering whether to approve mergers, so a deal would not only have to address antitrust concerns but also result in improved service, economic efficiencies and public safety for those using the railways.Yet not only has Canadian Pacific failed to convince Norfolk Southern that the merger could receive regulatory clearance, it has offered no protection for Norfolk Southern shareholders in the event the deal would be blocked, according to a source who asked not to be identified because details of the discussions are not public.The first time Canadian Pacific contacted Norfolk Southern about the deal was after a Bloomberg News report on Nov. 9 that cited people familiar with the matter who said the two companies had held early-stage merger talks, the Reuters source added.Norfolk Southern Chief Executive James Squires subsequently met with Harrison in Florida last week to discuss the potential merger, according the source. Squires told Harrison he viewed the regulatory obstacles as insurmountable and that Norfolk Southern had a plan of its own to drive shareholder value, the source added. Canadian Pacific is offering Norfolk Southern shareholders $46.72 in cash and 0.348 Canadian Pacific shares for every Norfolk Southern share they own, Norfolk Southern said in its statement.That works out to about $94.94, a 9 percent premium to Norfolk Southern, based on both stocks' Tuesday close.REGULATORY RISK  Regulators have been skeptical of North American railway  mergers for years.

(on.wsj.com/1SKLLZG)Shareholders could be paid as soon as May, provided the regulators approve a temporary trust structure that would keep the two companies independent as the regulatory process, which could take up to two years, gets underway, the Journal said.JPMorgan Chase, CP Rail's banker, has committed $10 billion to finance the merger, the paper said. CP Rail, Norfolk Southern and JPMorgan could not be immediately reached for comment outside regular business hours.Based on the findings of two former Surface Transportation Board (ST) commissioners it retained, Norfolk released a report on Monday night saying the merger was ""highly unlikely to be approved by the ST"". Norfolk added that the STB would not approve of the merger or a voting trust structure as ""neither would be in the public interest"" and that its strategic plan to take the company forward is superior to CP Rail's ""grossly inadequate and high-risk proposal"". Last week, Norfolk rejected CP Rail's $28.4 billion takeover offer saying the bid would face regulatory hurdles ""at any offer price"".Responding to the rejection, CP Rail said it would hold a conference call on Dec. 8 to discuss ""clarity, context and detail"" of its offer and ""correct every inaccuracy"".Activist investor William Ackman, who holds a 9.1 percent stake in CP Rail and is a big advocate of consolidation in the North American railway sector, will join the company's Chief Executive Hunter Harrison in the conference call.

In an unusual move, the executives were joined by shareholder Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management, who said that due diligence could be completed on Canadian Pacific's bid for the No. 4 U.S. railroad by the end of 2015.Ackman, one of the world's most powerful activist investors who controls $14.8 billion in assets, at times dominated the two-and-a-half-hour call with analysts. He argued the combined stock of the two companies could be worth $237 by mid 2016 and the merged company could achieve 3 percent annual revenue from 2018 onward. ""The upside, if this transaction is approved, is enormous,""  said Ackman, also a CP board member. Ackman said Canadian Pacific CEO Hunter Harrison and he have both been contacted by activists interested in a proxy fight with Norfolk Southern and both said if necessary they will take the proposed merger directly to shareholders.One of the biggest questions facing any proposed merger between major U.S. railroads - and Canadian Pacific has significant U.S. rail holdings - is whether it would receive regulatory approval. U.S. regulators have long been skeptical about rail mergers. Canadian National Railway's (CNR.TO) bid to buy Burlington Northern Santa Fe was blocked by authorities in 1999-2000.To alleviate regulatory concerns, CP said it was prepared to close the transaction using a voting trust. During the call Tuesday, CP CEO Harrison said that he did not think a trust would be a ""major hurdle"" for approval of the deal. Harrison has a reputation as a railroad turnaround expert and has dramatically improved CP's metrics since taking over.  CP executives and Ackman spoke to analysts after the railroad made a second bid for Norfolk Southern, of $32.86 in cash and 0.451 of a share in a new holding company that would own both Norfolk Southern and Canadian Pacific.  Norfolk Southern promptly rejected the bid and said Monday the merger was unlikely to win approval from U.S. regulators, citing a white paper by two former Surface Transportation Board commissioners that said regulatory approval would be incredibly hard to obtain.In a statement CEO Jim Squires described the new bid as ""grossly inadequate,"" that Norfolk Southern had reviewed the voting trust structure and did not believe the STB would approve it.The approval process by the STB could take up to 18 months and would require public hearings for comments for and against.

81,"  (Repeats with no changes)By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela BarbagliaNEW YORK/LONDON Dec 21 Dealmakers celebrating a record year for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that was bolstered by mega deals are pinning their hopes on a larger number of smaller deals to fuel consolidation in 2016.While the number of announced deals globally declined from 2014 by 2.1 percent to 39,687, deal volume rose 40.8 percent to a record $4.6 trillion, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data, as big companies pursued their dream matches.Most of the obvious mega deals have been explored already, investment bankers and lawyers said. But the number of transactions could increase next year as newly merged companies sell non-core assets and smaller companies consider tie-ups to stay competitive, they noted.""While the absolute dollar value of deals could very well decline in 2016, we expect the number of deals to increase year-on-year as the market broadens and we see more mid-sized transactions,"" said Gary Posternack, global head of M&A at Barclays Plc.The number of deals in 2015 that exceeded $30 billion in value was 18; together, they made up a quarter of the year's total volume. This compares with seven deals worth more than $30 billion in 2014, and one in 2013.This year's mega deals included many with long-expected operational efficiencies, such as brewer Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA's $106 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc, and oil major Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc.Financial engineering was a major factor in some deals. These included drug maker Pfizer Inc's $160 billion acquisition of Allergan Plc, a so-called inversion that would allow Pfizer to lower its tax bill by redomiciling from the United States to Ireland.The $120 billion merger of chemical conglomerates Dow Chemical Co and DuPont was structured so that the subsequent spin-offs of the combined companies' divisions would be tax-free.Other drivers included acquirers' need for speedier growth, as well as their strong balance sheet and confidence that the macro-economic environment was stable enough for them to splash out on big transactions. ""With economic growth still lagging, investors have been supportive of deals that make strategic sense and create value. The strategic rationale for M&A is more important than the price paid for it,"" Goldman Sachs Group Inc global M&A co-head Gilberto Pozzi said.PRICES RISING The median value of deals globally as a multiple of the target's annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose to 10.6 times in 2015, the highest since 2007, before a buyout boom ended with the global financial crisis.Combined with record deal volumes, this has raised concerns over whether the M&A cycle may be approaching its peak. But ""this is not an M&A bubble,"" said Luigi Rizzo, M&A head for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America Corp . ""The record value of deals this year was underpinned by the low cost of capital and the strength of the dollar.""A major difference from 2007 has been the absence of big leveraged buyouts. Private equity firms have mostly been sitting on the sidelines, preferring to sell companies to other strategic buyers, rather than trying to outbid them in auctions. A choppy junk debt market in the last few weeks has made it even more difficult for buyout firms to be competitive.In the United States, M&A has totaled $2.32 trillion so far in 2015, up 64 percent from the year-ago period. The United States accounted for 51 percent of worldwide deals, up from 43 percent a year ago.""M&A volumes relative to gross domestic product are just pushing average levels; we are not at the peak yet. The average M&A cycle lasts four to five years, and we are only now close to the third year,"" said Robin Rankin, co-head of global M&A at Credit Suisse Group AG.Asia also had a record M&A year, with volumes at $1.05 trillion, up 58 percent year-to-date. M&A in Europe reached $879.6 billion, up 6 percent, in the strongest year-to-date period for since 2008. ""Europe is at least two years behind the U.S. in the M&A cycle,"" Rizzo of Bank of America said. ""But going forward it will be the main story as telecoms and other key industries are set to consolidate.""HOSTILE APPROACHES Hostile bids for companies have also been getting bigger. Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd is pursuing a $36.7 billion takeover of U.S. peer Norfolk Southern Corp, while generic drug maker Perrigo Co Plc's shareholders last month rejected a $26 billion hostile bid by Mylan NV.""One thing that we may see is more confidence in the boardroom of targets to resist hostile approaches until the end; in other words, an increase in the number of 'hostile hostiles' that never turn friendly,"" said Igor Kirman, a partner at law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz who represented Perrigo in its defense against Mylan.""The Perrigo defense against Mylan, the largest hostile deal ever to go the full distance, shows that a target can pursue a sound defensive strategy, even in the absence of showstopper defenses or litigation, and win,"" Kirman added.The dealmaking boom has, unsurprisingly, led to an investment banking bonanza. Fees from completed M&A advisory globally increased 5 percent year-to-date to $24.5 billion, estimates from Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting show.The M&A market could slacken in 2016 if the economy and political environment turn sour.

82,"   By Greg Roumeliotis and Pamela Barbaglia | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON Dec 21 Dealmakers celebrating a record year for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) that was bolstered by mega deals are pinning their hopes on a larger number of smaller deals to fuel consolidation in 2016.While the number of announced deals globally declined from 2014 by 2.1 percent to 39,687, deal volume rose 40.8 percent to a record $4.6 trillion, according to preliminary Thomson Reuters data, as big companies pursued their dream matches.Most of the obvious mega deals have been explored already, investment bankers and lawyers said. But the number of transactions could increase next year as newly merged companies sell non-core assets and smaller companies consider tie-ups to stay competitive, they noted.""While the absolute dollar value of deals could very well decline in 2016, we expect the number of deals to increase year-on-year as the market broadens and we see more mid-sized transactions,"" said Gary Posternack, global head of M&A at Barclays Plc.The number of deals in 2015 that exceeded $30 billion in value was 18; together, they made up a quarter of the year's total volume. This compares with seven deals worth more than $30 billion in 2014, and one in 2013.This year's mega deals included many with long-expected operational efficiencies, such as brewer Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA's $106 billion acquisition of SABMiller Plc, and oil major Royal Dutch Shell Plc's $70 billion purchase of BG Group Plc.Financial engineering was a major factor in some deals. These included drug maker Pfizer Inc's $160 billion acquisition of Allergan Plc, a so-called inversion that would allow Pfizer to lower its tax bill by redomiciling from the United States to Ireland.The $120 billion merger of chemical conglomerates Dow Chemical Co and DuPont was structured so that the subsequent spin-offs of the combined companies' divisions would be tax-free.Other drivers included acquirers' need for speedier growth, as well as their strong balance sheet and confidence that the macro-economic environment was stable enough for them to splash out on big transactions.""With economic growth still lagging, investors have been supportive of deals that make strategic sense and create value. The strategic rationale for M&A is more important than the price paid for it,"" Goldman Sachs Group Inc global M&A co-head Gilberto Pozzi said. PRICES RISING The median value of deals globally as a multiple of the target's annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose to 10.6 times in 2015, the highest since 2007, before a buyout boom ended with the global financial crisis.Combined with record deal volumes, this has raised concerns over whether the M&A cycle may be approaching its peak.But ""this is not an M&A bubble,"" said Luigi Rizzo, M&A head for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Bank of America Corp . ""The record value of deals this year was underpinned by the low cost of capital and the strength of the dollar."" A major difference from 2007 has been the absence of big leveraged buyouts. Private equity firms have mostly been sitting on the sidelines, preferring to sell companies to other strategic buyers, rather than trying to outbid them in auctions. A choppy junk debt market in the last few weeks has made it even more difficult for buyout firms to be competitive.In the United States, M&A has totaled $2.32 trillion so far in 2015, up 64 percent from the year-ago period. The United States accounted for 51 percent of worldwide deals, up from 43 percent a year ago.""M&A volumes relative to gross domestic product are just pushing average levels; we are not at the peak yet. The average M&A cycle lasts four to five years, and we are only now close to the third year,"" said Robin Rankin, co-head of global M&A at Credit Suisse Group AG.Asia also had a record M&A year, with volumes at $1.05 trillion, up 58 percent year-to-date. M&A in Europe reached $879.6 billion, up 6 percent, in the strongest year-to-date period for since 2008.""Europe is at least two years behind the U.S. in the M&A cycle,"" Rizzo of Bank of America said. ""But going forward it will be the main story as telecoms and other key industries are set to consolidate."" HOSTILE APPROACHES Hostile bids for companies have also been getting bigger. Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd is pursuing a $36.7 billion takeover of U.S. peer Norfolk Southern Corp, while generic drug maker Perrigo Co Plc's shareholders last month rejected a $26 billion hostile bid by Mylan NV.""One thing that we may see is more confidence in the boardroom of targets to resist hostile approaches until the end; in other words, an increase in the number of 'hostile hostiles' that never turn friendly,"" said Igor Kirman, a partner at law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz who represented Perrigo in its defense against Mylan.""The Perrigo defense against Mylan, the largest hostile deal ever to go the full distance, shows that a target can pursue a sound defensive strategy, even in the absence of showstopper defenses or litigation, and win,"" Kirman added.The dealmaking boom has, unsurprisingly, led to an investment banking bonanza. Fees from completed M&A advisory globally increased 5 percent year-to-date to $24.5 billion, estimates from Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting show.The M&A market could slacken in 2016 if the economy and political environment turn sour. For example, dealmakers have been speculating about whether a big rise interest rates could dampen dealmaking.""I don't think interest rates alone will make a big difference in M&A; however, uncertainty in the financing markets and global political climate could be more of a concern than anything else,"" said Eileen Nugent, global co-head of law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom's transactions practices.""But all of the traditional factors for a robust M&A market are still there and confidence is strong.""

85,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Industry groups representing major freight customers of Norfolk Southern Corp have asked the U.S. rail regulator to reject any bid for the railroad by Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd, according to letters viewed by Reuters. The opposition from a broad array of customers to the hostile bid for the Norfolk, Virginia-based railroad could  significantly harm Canadian Pacific's case if an expected  lengthy proxy battle is resolved and a merger reaches the Surface Transportation Board for a review. The Canadian company in mid-November disclosed its $28 billion offer to buy Norfolk Southern. It would be the first merger involving a U.S. railroad since the Surface Transportation Board rewrote the rules in 2001 after a wave of consolidation reduced the number of major North American railroads to seven from 35.The proposed merger could face a tough review, and the regulator is expected to give customers even more time than in the past to air concerns at public hearings. Norfolk Southern has rebuffed several bids from Canadian Pacific since November.The letters have not been made public but copies were  viewed by Reuters. Sent in December, they express concerns over Canadian Pacific's plans to cut costs at Norfolk Southern would hurt service levels and that a merger would lead to a continental duopoly meaning higher prices for customers.Norfolk Southern declined to comment on the letters.  A Canadian Pacific spokesman said the company ""is aware of some shipper concerns"" but looks forward to discussing the benefits of its bid with all stakeholders. The documents also include letters from representatives of several state legislatures expressing opposition to the deal. The letters include a joint one to Canadian Pacific, with the Surface Transportation Board carbon-copied, from the heads of the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of Global Automakers - which between them represent large automakers and suppliers including General Motors Co and Toyota Motor Corp. A large proportion of finished vehicles travel most of the way by train from U.S. manufacturing plants to dealerships. ""(P)revious rail mergers of this magnitude have been followed by pro-longed periods of poor service levels and higher rates,"" the joint letter dated Dec. 22 states. ""We urge CP to abandon its merger ambitions and to focus its attentions upon enhancing its current levels of customer service."" Major rail mergers in the 1990s, such as the 1999 carve-up of Conrail between Norfolk Southern and CSX Corp resulted in short-term collapses as railroads failed to integrate their networks smoothly. In a separate letter, Subaru Motor Co said it opposed a merger ""as we believe it would limit the competitive balance"" among North America's railroads. The manufacturers' associations of Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginia also wrote to the STB, as did the Michigan Agri-Business Association and the Palmetto AgriBusiness Council (PABC), which represents farmers, banks and agricultural investors in South Carolina. ""We are justifiably concerned that Canadian Pacific셲 proposal to slash resources available to the current Norfolk Southern threatens the economy of our state,"" Charles Higdon, chief executive of the Kentucky Association of Manufacturers, wrote to the STB on Dec. 22.    In a letter dated Dec. 8, Ernie Thrasher, CEO of Xcoal Energy & Resources, wrote he was ""concerned that the short-term nature of CP's operating plan would be detrimental to the long-term requirements of the U.S. coal industry and energy sector.""In a Dec. 23 letter to the STB, the head of short line railroad holding company Watco cautioned that many in the rail industry expect the next round of mergers will be the last. ""The proposed CP-NS merger likely would result in a national duopoly, which would dramatically reduce competitive rail options for customers,"" Watco CEO Rick Webb wrote.

Those representatives include Matt Rose, chairman of BNSF, the No. 2 U.S. railroad which is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.No. 1 U.S. railroad Union Pacific Corp's chief executive Lance Fritz told Reuters on Wednesday he believes major railroad mergers are not in the interest of the rail industry or customers and is working behind the scenes to make sure none take place. By law, major U.S. railroads may only discuss topics that affect the entire industry.""We haven't had any new consensus come out of this,"" Ward said. ""To be honest we've had one or two discussions, but we were all against mergers to begin with.""Canadian Pacific in mid-November disclosed its $28 billion offer to buy Norfolk Southern.

97,"   By Nick Carey | LOMBARD, Ill.  LOMBARD, Ill. A potential merger of Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd and Norfolk Southern would make it hard for No. 3 U.S. railroad CSX Corp to survive alone and ratchet up pressure for more industry consolidation, the chairman of No. 2 U.S. railroad BNSF said on Thursday.""CSX would be at an enormous (competitive) disadvantage and so there would be another step towards consolidation,"" Matt Rose told Reuters on the sidelines of the semiannual meeting of the Midwest Association of Rail Shippers.Rose reiterated that this is not the right time for mergers as ""our belief is that our customers do not want mergers to occur."" But he said if a merger of Canadian Pacific and Norfolk Southern appeared likely then BNSF, which is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, would bid for another railroad. Canadian Pacific in mid-November disclosed its $28 billion offer to buy Norfolk Southern.Norfolk Southern has spurned the Canadian railroad's interest, setting the scene for a proxy battle. Some customers and legislators have written to the Surface Transportation Board, the regulator that would review any merger proposal, opposing the proposed deal. Rose said BNSF would not likely make a competitive bid for Norfolk Southern. Canadian Pacific has said operating synergies from a merger with Norfolk Southern would lead to savings of more than $1.8 billion. Rose said that figure is very high compared with prior rail mergers. ""I don셳 know if we would ever do a competitive bid for Norfolk Southern because we don셳 see $1.8 billion in natural synergies. We may (do a bid), but we think the synergy numbers are enormous."" Any deal would likely face a review from the Surface Transportation Board, which tightened guidelines for mergers following a slew of deals in the 1990s. The regulator would have to weigh whether a Canadian Pacific and Norfolk Southern merger would lead to other deals.Rose said a deal would see the ""final map redrawn"" for North America's railroads.""You don셳 have to have a lot of imagination when there셲 only seven railroads to get down to two railroads,"" he said. ""The chairs get taken away pretty quick."" Rose said he has discussed the merger issue with Buffett and has his support for whatever is in the long-term interests of BNSF.""He expects me to run this company.

98,"  Jan 21 Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd, the unwanted suitor of U.S. railroad Norfolk Southern Corp, reported a 29 percent decline in fourth-quarter profit as falling prices for commodities such as oil and coal hit freight volumes.Canada's No. 2 railroad said its net income slipped to C$319 million ($220.9 million), or C$2.08 per share, in the three months ended Dec.31, from C$451 million, or C$2.63 per share, a year earlier. Revenue slipped 4 percent to C$1.68 billion. Canadian Pacific unveiled a $28 billion offer for Norfolk Southern in mid-November. However, the No. 4 U.S. railroad has repeatedly rejected CP's advances, saying the proposed terms were ""grossly inadequate"" and that a deal would face substantial regulatory risks.

99,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Facing a possible proxy battle over a hostile bid from Canadian Pacific (CP.TO), Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N) must persuade shareholders of its viability when it reports quarterly results on Wednesday.The No. 4 U.S. railroad must accomplish this while navigating a freight recession that is pummeling the rail industry.""This is a very important time for NS to prove to the Street that it can post significant improvements, but it must do that in a very tough environment,"" said Mark Levin, a managing director at BB&T Capital Markets. ""It looks like 2016 will be a brutally tough year for the entire industry, but the onus will be on NS management to prove investors wrong.""Canadian Pacific in mid-November disclosed its $28 billion offer to buy Norfolk Southern, touting major savings from synergies.Norfolk Southern has rejected the advances, saying it can offer solid returns as a standalone entity. Last month it said it aims for compound earnings per share growth in the double digits this year, though that forecast assumes stabilizing commodity volumes. But commodities continue to slide, especially coal, which affects Norfolk Southern in particular. Low fuel prices have encouraged utilities to burn cheaper natural gas, and the strong U.S. dollar hurts exports. Railroad coal volumes fell nearly 12 percent in 2015 and the slide has continued. In the week ending Jan. 16, coal volumes were down 32.6 percent versus the year-ago week.  ""Coal is like catching a falling knife"" in 2016, Matt Rose, chairman of No. 2 U.S. railroad BNSF, which is owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N), told Reuters earlier this month.""The question is how to manage that (declining coal) best for shareholders,"" said Cowen & Co analyst Jason Seidl. ""You have to judge how many years a (rail) line has left in it and that's not easy no matter who's in charge.""Norfolk Southern announced Jan. 12 it was combining two divisions to streamline costs. Seidl said the railroad ""might have some wiggle room"" for more cuts.  A big question is how dogged Canadian Pacific will be in pursuing Norfolk Southern. Chief Executive Hunter Harrison has not ruled out that the railroad could abandon its bid. Analyst Levin said the fact Norfolk Southern shares are down more than its peers - nearly 19 percent year to date - suggests ""investors see less and less possibility of a deal ever happening and that they doubt NS can achieve their long-term strategies.""

The plan is ""dynamic and flexible,"" he said, adding, ""if necessary, we have the ability to pivot to additional cost savings.""Earlier on Wednesday the No. 4 U.S. railroad posted lower quarterly profit and outlined a plan to cut annual costs by more than $650 million by 2020. Canadian Pacific in mid-November disclosed its $28 billion offer to buy Norfolk Southern, touting far higher cost savings of $1.8 billion.Customers of Norfolk Southern and lawmakers have complained to rail regulator the Surface Transportation Board that Canadian Pacific would gut the U.S. railroad by cutting employees and investments.Norfolk Southern's plan includes cutting 1,200 jobs in 2016, a 4 percent workforce reduction, with a total of 2,000 job losses by 2020. The company plans to downgrade 1,500 miles (2,414 km) of track associated with declining coal business, with 1,000 miles of that in 2016.

126,"  (Adds details from letter, background, context, comment from CP)By Nick CareyCHICAGO, April 7 The U.S. military on Thursday raised concerns with a federal rail regulator over the voting trust Canadian Pacific has proposed as part of its takeover bid for Norfolk Southern and said the deal could adversely affect the country's national defense.In a letter to the U.S. Surface Transportation Board (STB) dated April 7, the Department of Defense said CP's proposal to have its chief executive, Hunter Harrison, run Norfolk Southern as part of the voting trust ""could prove to be untenable due to the appearance of common control"" of the two railroads.CP, which is Canada's second-largest railroad, disclosed a $28 billion offer for Norfolk Southern in mid-November. The Calgary-based company has said a merger would result in savings of more than $1.8 billion annually. Norfolk Southern has rebuffed all advances from CP.The letter comes as a response to a March 2 petition from CP to the STB seeking a ""declaratory order"" on its voting trust proposal. The idea would be to place both railroads in a trust - if they agreed to merge - pending a review by the STB. Under the STB's merger rules, common control is not allowed.The Department of Defense said putting Harrison, a septuagenarian railroading legend, at the helm of Norfolk Southern while a review was underway would put him in a position in which he ""must make business decisions with potentially competing interests."" The Department said in the letter that ""it is too early to determine"" whether a merger would degrade national defense, but said ""the potential certainly exists.""Under the rules for a voting trust for a major railroad merger, there may be no collusion, joint decision-making or any other form of common control prior to regulatory approval. The two must continue to operate as separate entities until a merger gets the green light. A spokesman for CP said the railroad looks forward to ""providing a fulsome response"" at the proper time to the department's comments.The U.S. military relies on rail networks to move defense-related cargo across the country, both during peace and times of war.A number of major rail customers have recommended against any merger, citing concerns that CP's plans to cut costs at Norfolk Southern would gut the railroad and harm service. They include package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc , the single biggest customer of the major U.S. railroads.Some U.S. politicians have also spoken out against a merger.

145,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N), the No. 4 U.S. railroad, on Wednesday reported a lower quarterly net profit due to a 7 percent drop in freight volumes, but the results just exceeded market expectations because of cost cutting and efficiency measures. The decline in freight at the Norfolk, Virginia-based company was led by a precipitous 25 percent drop in revenue from transporting coal.The company's shares fell more than 2 percent after the announcement.The railroad said it expects freight volumes to increase in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus 2015. But the company said it expects high inventories of coal and retail goods to weigh on second-half results in 2016. Automotive shipments should also be down for the rest of 2016.Norfolk Southern said a mild winter and above-average temperatures extending into the second quarter exacerbated an ""inventory overhang"" for coal should hurt volumes into 2017. But, in a conference call with analysts, executives said recent hot weather and rising natural gas prices could boost coal burning by utilities.Like other major U.S. railroads, Norfolk Southern has faced declining coal volumes as utilities have switched to burning cheaper natural gas. A strong U.S. dollar has compounded the problem as it has hurt coal exports.The railroads have scrambled to cut expenses, mothballing locomotives and furloughing workers. There has been extra pressure on Norfolk Southern to improve its performance after a failed takeover bid earlier this year by Canadian Pacific (CP.TO), which promised massive savings and thus larger profits for shareholders. Norfolk Southern said it remains on track to cut costs by $200 million in 2016 and to repurchase $800 million in shares this year.The company cut its planned capital expenditures for 2016 by $100 million to $1.9 billion.Norfolk Southern posted second-quarter net income of $405 million, or $1.36 per share, down more than 6 percent from $433 million, or $1.41 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $1.35.The company reported quarterly revenue of $2.45 billion, down more than 9 percent from $2.7 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $2.48 billion.Norfolk Southern's operating ratio improved in the quarter 1.4 percentage points to 68.6 percent. This measure of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is a key metric of efficiency and profitability for analysts and investors.In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Norfolk Southern shares were down 2 percent at $90.83.

153,"   By Nick Carey | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC.N), the No. 4 U.S. railroad, on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected profit as a continuing cost-cutting drive offset a revenue drop of more than 7 percent and said it expected fourth-quarter freight volumes would be flat to slightly up after five consecutive quarters of declines.Overall freight volumes at the Norfolk, Virginia-based company were down 4 percent in the third quarter from the previous year, lead by a 15 percent decline in coal. Like other major U.S. railroads, Norfolk Southern has been struggling since early 2015 with a precipitous fall in coal freight as utilities have switched to burning cheaper natural gas. Coal exports also have been hurt by the strong U.S. dollar. The railroad saw revenue decline in most of its businesses, with the exceptions of agriculture, which was flat, and metals and construction, which were up 2 percent. Norfolk Southern reported net income of $460 million, or $1.55 per share, up 1.7 percent from $452 million, or $1.49 per share a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected earnings per share of $1.45.Revenue fell to $2.52 billion from $2.71 billion. Analysts  expected revenue of $2.53 billion. Norfolk Southern managed to offset freight declines in the quarter with a 10 percent reduction in costs, to $1.7 billion from $1.9 billion. It also benefited from a lower tax rate.The railroad saw its operating ratio - or operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, a key metric for rail analysts and investors - improve to 67.5 percent from 69.7 percent a year earlier. ""As we move forward, we are well positioned for growth opportunities longer term and confident in our ability to drive shareholder value,"" Chief Executive James Squires said in a statement.In morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, Norfolk Southern shares were off 1.2 percent at $92.10.
