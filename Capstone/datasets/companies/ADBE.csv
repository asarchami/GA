0,"  SAN FRANCISCO Jan 7 Battery Ventures has lured away Adrian Cockcroft, the engineer who remade Netflix's  streaming-entertainment service, to become the venture-capital firm's first technology fellow.Cockcroft will help Battery advise and evaluate companies and formulate investment theses, said Mike Dauber, a principal at Battery, in a blog post on Tuesday. While Cockcroft will play a role in sourcing deals, he won't be a partner.In his own blog post, Cockcroft said he would counsel large enterprise companies who want to work more in the cloud-- using remote computers that work over the Internet rather than proprietary centralized computers. In Netflix's case, Cockcroft moved its streaming entertainment to Amazon's cloud platform. Hiring entrepreneurs-in-residence is a common practice in Silicon Valley, where venture capital firms see it as a way to foster the next big start-up. But Cockcroft's role as technology fellow is different because while EIRs typically stay for 6-12 months, Cockcroft will stay with Battery long term, Dauber wrote. Bringing Cockcroft into the fold underscores Battery's commitment to enterprise computing. Its prior investments include Akamai, an Internet delivery network, and Omniture, the online marketing and web analytics business acquired by Adobe. Last year, Battery raised $900 million to invest, including its $650 million Battery X fund.",2014-01-07,ADBE,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 3:05pm EST",Battery Ventures lands Netflix executive Cockcroft,http://www.reuters.com//article/batteryventures-cockcroft-idUSL2N0KH1RR20140107?type=companyNews
1,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Jan 14 Roughly 60,000 Silicon Valley workers won clearance to pursue a lawsuit accusing Apple Inc, Google Inc and other companies of conspiring to drive down pay by not poaching each other's staff, after a federal appeals court refused to let the defendants appeal a class certification order.The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals late on Tuesday let stand an order by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California to let the workers sue as a group, and pursue what the defendants said could exceed $9 billion of damages.The case began in 2011 when five software engineers sued Apple, Google, Adobe Systems Inc, Intel Corp  and others over an alleged ""overarching conspiracy"" to suppress pay by agreeing not to recruit or hire each other's employees.These defendants were accused of violating the Sherman Act and Clayton Act antitrust laws by conspiring to eliminate competition for labor, depriving workers of job mobility and hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation. Class certification can make it easier for plaintiffs to extract larger awards, at lower cost than if they sued individually. It could also add pressure on defendants to settle.""We look forward to seeking justice for the class at trial,"" said Kelly Dermody, a partner at Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann & Bernstein, co-lead counsel for the class. She said a trial is set to begin on May 27. A Google spokesman declined to comment. An Intel spokesman had no immediate comment. Adobe and Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In seeking the appeal, the companies had called Koh's order ""manifestly erroneous"". They said that the claims were too disparate because they covered employees with 2,400 job titles at seven companies, and that the plaintiffs did not allege any impact on total hiring.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also asked the 9th Circuit to grant permission for the appeal.Much of the case was built on emails between top officials, including the late Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs and former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt, that the plaintiffs said reflected understandings not to raid each other's talent.The 9th Circuit decision is Hariharan et al v. Adobe Systems Inc et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 13-80223. The lower-court case is In re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 11-02509.",2014-01-15,ADBE,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 8:55pm EST",Silicon Valley workers may pursue collusion case as group- court,http://www.reuters.com//article/siliconvalley-collusion-lawsuit-idUSL2N0KP02P20140115?type=companyNews

13,"  (Adds comment from plaintiffs' lawyer, details about plaintiffs)By Jonathan StempelMay 23 Four major Silicon Valley companies have formally agreed to pay $324.5 million to settle claims brought by employees who accused them of limiting competition by colluding not to poach each other's talent.The settlement, between Apple Inc, Google Inc , Intel Corp, Adobe Systems Inc and roughly 64,000 workers, was disclosed in papers filed late on Thursday with a federal court in San Jose, California.U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh has been asked to preliminarily approve the accord at a June 19 hearing, over an objection by one of the four named plaintiffs, Michael Devine, who says the settlement let the companies off too easily.The payout was originally reported by Reuters but not officially confirmed.Lawyers for the plaintiffs may seek up to 25 percent of the settlement amount in legal fees. Filed in 2011, the lawsuit accused Silicon Valley companies of conspiring to limit competition and keep wages down for engineers, programmers and other technical staff.The case has been closely watched because of the potential $9 billion of damages sought, and its occasional embarrassing revelations into how Silicon Valley operates.Among the communications that became public were pointed emails from Apple co-founder Steve Jobs that at times admonished then-Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt to stop raiding his company. Thursday's settlement gives workers only a few thousand dollars each on average.The companies' combined profit in their latest fiscal years was about $60 billion, with three-fifths coming from Apple.In court papers, two law firms representing the plaintiffs said Devine's objection should not doom what they consider a fair and reasonable settlement for an antitrust case, and which serves the best interests of the class. They pointed to a July 2012 jury verdict in the same court that found Toshiba Corp conspired to fix prices in the liquid crystal display market but awarded just $87 million of damages, one-tenth of what was sought.""The amount of the settlement does not relate to the size or profitability of the companies we sued,"" Joseph Saveri, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview. ""It relates to the claims we made, the law that applies to them, and the facts that we could prove at trial. Based on that, I think the settlement is a significant achievement.""Devine did not immediately respond on Friday to a request for comment.Koh on May 16 approved separate settlements totaling $20 million over alleged poaching by Walt Disney Co's  Lucasfilm and Pixar units, and by Intuit Inc.The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California is In re: High-Tech Employee Antitrust Litigation, 11-02509.

23,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON New international tax rules proposed on Tuesday could eliminate structures that have allowed companies such as Google Inc (GOOGL.O) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) to shave billions of dollars off their tax bills.The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) announced a series of measures that, if implemented by members, could stop companies from employing many commonly-used practices to shift profits into tax havens.Corporate tax avoidance has become a hot political topic following media coverage and parliamentary investigations into the arrangements many big companies use to cut tax bills.Amazon and Google say they pay all the taxes they should. Analysts say competitive pressures force companies to seek to minimize all costs, including tax.Last year, the Group of 20 leading economies asked the OECD to develop an action plan to tackle the problem.Big U.S. technology companies could be those most affected by the OECD's plans but others could also be hit, including pharmaceuticals and branded consumer goods firms, as well as many European companies.Chris Morgan, Head of Tax Policy at accountants KPMG in London, said the proposals were ""balanced"" and while some firms would pay more tax, big business accepted the need for change.Anti-poverty charity ActionAid criticized the plans saying some of the measures envisaged would be too expensive for developing countries to implement.The draft proposals announced have been agreed by all G20 members and OECD members, which include most major industrialized countries, the OECD said in a statement.But the measures form part of a larger ""(tax) base erosion and profit shifting"" program that will conclude next year. Only then will countries look at enshrining the results of the program in law.TREATY MISUSE  For more than 50 years, the OECD’s work on international taxation has been focused on ensuring companies are not taxed twice on the same profits. The fear was that this would hamper trade and limit global growth.Over the years, the OECD has formulated a standardized model tax treaty which allows countries to split taxation rights and avoid double taxation, partly by providing reliefs from measures intended to stop tax avoidance, such as withholding taxes.But companies have been using such treaties to ensure profits are not taxed anywhere.For example, search giant Google takes advantage of tax treaties to channel more than $8 billion in untaxed profits out of Europe and Asia each year and into a subsidiary that is tax resident in Bermuda, which has no income tax.Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt has said changes to rules that increase its tax bill would hit innovation.The OECD's proposals would make amendments to its model treaty so that cross-border transactions would not benefit from the reliefs in tax treaties, if a principal reason for engaging in the transactions was to avoid tax.""We are putting an end to double non-taxation,"" OECD head of tax Pascal Saint-Amans said in a call with reporters. The think tank, which also advises members on economic policy, also wants curbs on how much profit companies can report in centralized intra-company lending and purchasing arms, which are often based in tax havens.Where such subsidiaries generate large profits on the back of intra-company trade, the OECD said the profits should be shared across the group.This could hit UK telecoms provider Vodafone Group Plc (VOD.L), which has a Luxembourg subsidiary that buys telephone equipment for the group. Vodafone Procurement Company's 200 staff generated profits of more than 400 million euros ($518.5 million) last year, making it one of the group's smallest but most profitable divisions. An unusual Luxembourg tax rule allowed the subsidiary to pay no tax on that profit.Vodafone said businesses across Europe already benefited from savings achieved by the Luxembourg operation and that it did not expect a significant impact on its business from the OECD measures.     TAX RESIDENCE The OECD has also proposed changes in the rules on tax residence that allow U.S. tech giants to generate billions of dollars in sales in many countries but not have those revenues assessed for tax by those countries' tax authorities.A long-standing rule that allows a company to operate a warehouse in a country without creating a tax residence there should be reconsidered, the OECD said.This would potentially hit Internet retailer Amazon as the warehouse exclusion allowed Amazon to channel 15 billion euros last year in European sales to a subsidiary in Luxembourg, where it can build up profits tax free.A raft of companies which sell online including Apple Inc's iTunes service, software provider Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE.O) and e-commerce group eBay Inc. (EBAY.O) could also be forced to report revenues in the countries where they are generated, if the OECD's proposal that having a ""significant digital presence"" in a country would also create a tax residence.A Reuters investigation last year found that three quarters of the 50 biggest U.S. technology companies channeled revenues from European sales into low tax jurisdictions such as Ireland and Switzerland, rather than reporting them nationally.The companies all say they comply with tax rules in all the countries where they operate.     Anton Hume, Global Head of Transfer Pricing at accountants BDO, said the measures could prompt companies to change their structures and move jobs out of tax havens: ""It may mean that a lot of activities are onshored again.""However, Ireland's jobs and enterprise minister, Richard Bruton, said his country would not lose out.""As countries move away from other tax haven situations, a good country with a very clear, certain, regime like Ireland can stand to gain,"" he said.

24,"   By Paul Carsten | BEIJING  BEIJING Computer software maker Adobe Systems Inc will shut its Chinese research and development arm, as U.S. technology firms face an increasingly hostile government in the world's second-biggest economy. The California-based company will maintain its China sales offices, Adobe said in an e-mail to Reuters on Wednesday, but research and development (R&D) operations will cease by the end of December. Lay-offs have already begun and will affect more around 300 people, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Foreign companies, particularly U.S. technology firms, have come under increasing scrutiny in China as Beijing pushes hard on information security in the wake of last year's cyber espionage revelations by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.  The government has also ramped up investigations into foreign companies operating in China, wielding a 2008 anti-monopoly law to probe numerous firms' local practices. Western business lobbies have labeled the tactic as protectionism. ""The overall climate in China against Western enterprises has been quite negative and that's one of the major reasons,"" said the person, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.The closure of Adobe's China R&D arm is also affected by rampant software piracy in the country, as well as the company's shift toward a cloud-based software-as-a-service business model and away from one-off boxed sales of software and licenses, the person familiar with the situation said.  ""Adobe's presence in China will be focused on market development activities moving forward, and it will be dissolving and closing its research and development (R&D) branch there,"" the company said. ""Adobe will maintain its sales presence in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hong Kong and Taiwan.""Other U.S. technology firms which have drawn the ire of China's government include software giant Microsoft Corp and chipset maker Qualcomm Inc. Microsoft is the target of an anti-trust investigation for suspected issues concerning its Windows operating system and Microsoft Office. The probe has been described as ""Kafka-esque"" by experts because of Microsoft's negligible revenues in China due to piracy.

28,"  SAN FRANCISCO Former Adobe Chief Marketing Officer Melissa Dyrdahl hopes to bring a spa-like feel to the experience of breast cancer screenings. Her start-up, Ella Health, has opened seven mammogram centers across the United States, in places ranging from Toms  River, New Jersey to San Francisco. Ella's pitch: to improve the often nerve-wracking process so women will not skip their annual mammogram. ""We want women to feel like they're in a spa, not a cold and clinical hospital,"" Dyrdahl, who is chief executive of the company, said in an interview. For instance, Ella reminds its technicians to be ""warm and caring"" and gives patients a private dressing room and heated cloth robe. In recent years, the company has secured capital to purchase 3D mammography units and offer a test that takes X-rays at different angles of the breast. At some $450,000, the equipment is far more expensive than standard mammography units. Dyrdahl, also a former marketing director at Apple Inc (AAPL.O), said she joined the company after years of ""terrible"" mammogram experiences. Dyrdahl is herself a breast cancer survivor.  The American Cancer Society recommends that women over 40 get annual mammograms, but researchers have found that 50 percent of women with insurance opt out, even though most women in that age range are not responsible for additional out-of-pocket costs. Ella Health is marketing its service to smaller, independent obstetricians and gynecologists, as well as directly to female patients.  It is branching out into other areas of women's health. It recently launched a physical therapy service linked to major life events, such as pregnancy and menopause. Dyrdahl said she is also exploring mental and sexual health. Ella Health has raised funding from Polaris Venture Partners in Boston, CHL Medical Partners and private investors. The company is planning to raise additional funding in the coming year to fuel expansion across the United States.

29,"  (Adds comments from ShoppterTrak founder, Adobe online data)Nov 29 U.S. shoppers spent slightly less money at brick-and-mortar stores on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday than across the same two days in 2013, while online sales surged to record highs, data showed on Saturday.Sales at retail stores totaled about $12.29 billion on Thursday and Friday, down 0.5 percent from the $12.35 billion spent last year, according to estimates by ShopperTrak. The research firm stuck by its forecast for November and December sales to increase 3.8 percent.The data highlights the waning importance of Black Friday, which until a few years ago kicked off the holiday shopping season, as more retailers open their doors on Thanksgiving Day and start discounting earlier in the month.It also points to the intense price competition among retailers, which have been discounting by 40 to 70 percent this year compared with 30 to 50 percent in the recent past, ShopperTrak founder Bill Martin told Reuters.""I think what we are seeing is those early promotions coupled with some pretty deep discounts,"" he said. Martin said he had expected a 0.5 to 1 percent sales gain. Customer traffic rose 27.3 percent on Thanksgiving Day from a year earlier, reflecting the sharp increase in retailers opening for business on that day. Traffic fell 5.6 percent on Black Friday, ShopperTrak said.Martin cautioned against taking the two days' figures as sign of slack holiday demand. He noted that Thanksgiving and Black Friday combined for just 1 percent growth last year, underperforming growth of 3.1 percent during the entire season spanning the months of November and December.Reflecting the decreased significance of Black Friday, ShopperTrak expects ""Super Saturday"" on Dec. 20 to rank as the busiest shopping day this year and says seven of the top 10 sales days of the season are still to come. Separate data underscored the ongoing shift of shopping to online retailers.Online Thanksgiving and Black Friday sales tracked by Adobe Systems Inc were a record $1.33 billion and $2.4 billion, up 25 percent and 24 percent from a year earlier, respectively. Between Nov. 1 and Nov. 28, $32 billion has been spent online, up 14 percent from 2013, Adobe said. The proliferation of smartphones has made consumers more likely to shop online, with 29 percent of Thanksgiving sales via mobile devices, up from 21 percent on the same day last year. Adobe said its findings were based on more than 350 million visits to 4,500 retail websites.""So much more mobile shopping is happening and that's part of what's driving e-commerce activity to new heights every year,"" said Tamara Gaffney, principal analyst at Adobe Digital Index.Several traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers reported strong online growth, a reflection of efforts to compete more aggressively on price with Amazon.com. Target Corp , which is offering free shipping for online orders during the holiday season, said it had record online sales on Thursday, up more than 40 percent from 2013.Protesters have urged shoppers to boycott stores as the holiday season gets underway, saying economic inequality in the United States contributes to incidents such as the Ferguson, Missouri, shooting of an unarmed black teenager by a white policeman.Martin, however, told Reuters he did not think the protests have so far had a significant impact on sales on a national level.

The gains came after the S&P 500 shed 2.4 percent over the previous three sessions, the worst run for the benchmark index in two months, as weak oil prices weighed on the energy sector.Still, lower oil prices likely encouraged consumer holiday spending, and November retail sales beat expectations. Retailers were among the day's biggest percentage gainers on the S&P 500, including Urban Outfitters, up 7.6 percent at $32.29. The S&P retail index jumped 1 percent.""It suggests overall spending is going to do well,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York. He said a year-end rally could take the S&P to about 2,100. Other economic data showed a strengthening labor market, as weekly initial jobless claims dipped.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 63.19 points, or 0.36 percent, to 17,596.34, the S&P 500 gained 9.19 points, or 0.45 percent, to 2,035.33 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 24.14 points, or 0.52 percent, to 4,708.16.The S&P energy sector, which is down 14.7 percent for the year so far, pared gains late in the session to close flat. Oil prices are down more than 40 percent from June highs. Adding to investor concern, the fate of a $1.1 trillion U.S. spending bill was put in doubt by Democratic objections over a provision to roll back part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.

Oil's declines have underscored concerns about global demand, and with the S&P 500 having hit a record high only last week, investors were loath to fight the downward pressure on stocks, which accelerated in the final minutes of trading. The S&P dropped 3.5 percent on the week after seven straight weeks of gains.The S&P energy sector was down 2.2 percent on the day. It is down 16.5 percent this year, the worst performing of 10 S&P sectors.

45,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Jan 12 Walt Disney Co, Sony Corp  and DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc urged a federal judge to throw out a antitrust lawsuit accusing them of conspiring not to poach each other's animators in order to keep wages down.The defendants told U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh in San Jose, California, that the plaintiff animators took too long to sue by waiting until five years after the U.S. Department of Justice in 2009 began probing recruiting practices at Silicon Valley and other technology companies.In a Friday night filing, the defendants also called it ""implausible"" to believe they would collude to suppress wages after the federal probe began, and after several companies including Disney had settled related private litigation.""The court might ask what, exactly, these plaintiffs have uncovered that was somehow missed by the industrious High-Tech plaintiffs,"" the companies said. ""The short answer is: nothing."" Daniel Small, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined immediate comment on Monday, saying he had yet to review the defendants' filings.Blue Sky Studios, a unit of 21st Century Fox Inc, is also a defendant. Lighting artist Georgia Cano, character effects artist Robert Nitsch and production engineer David Wentworth are the named plaintiffs.The lawsuit accuses the defendants of having illegally suppressed animators' wages since 2004 by agreeing not to cold call employees, alerting each other to hiring offers, and agreeing not to offer more pay in response to counteroffers. Disney's Lucasfilm and Pixar units, and Intuit Inc  settled similar claims covering other workers for a combined $20 million, while Apple Inc, Google Inc, Intel Corp and Adobe Systems Inc reached their own $324.5 million settlement last May.Koh last August rejected the $324.5 million accord as too low. Technology workers later asked the federal appeals court in San Francisco to overturn that ruling. As in other anti-poaching lawsuits, the animators' lawsuit relies in part on emails and testimony under oath.It cites, among other things, a 2005 email from a Pixar human resources executive alluding to a ""gentleman's agreement"" not to poach, and testimony in which Lucasfilm founder and ""Star Wars"" director George Lucas was said to want to avoid bidding wars ""because we don't have the margins for that sort of thing.""A hearing on the dismissal motion is set for March 26.The case is In re: Animation Workers Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 14-04062.
