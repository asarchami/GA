0,"  March 19 Entergy Corp reduced the 685-megawatt Pilgrim nuclear power plant in Massachusetts early Wednesday to clean the condenser, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said in an email.     Electricity traders said the unit was reduced to about half power early Wednesday from full power earlier in the day.     The NRC said the company cleans the condenser on a semi-regular basis to reduce the buildup of biological material, such as algae.     Traders estimated the unit would return to full power in a day or so.       ---------------------------------------------------------- PLANT BACKGROUND/TIMELINE STATE:        Massachusetts        COUNTY:       Plymouth        TOWN:         Plymouth        OPERATOR:     Entergy  OWNER(S):     Entergy        UNIT(S):      685 MW Nuclear        FUEL:         Nuclear  DISPATCH:     Baseload  COST:         $462.25 million in 2007 US dollars    TIMELINE:        1972 -        Pilgrim enters service        2006 -        Entergy files with NRC to renew the original                     40-year operating license for an additional                20 years        2012 -        NRC renews reactor license 2032 -        License expires   (Reporting by Scott DiSavino)   ",2014-03-19,ETR,"Wed Mar 19, 2014 | 10:29am EDT",Entergy reduces Massachusetts Pilgrim reactor to clean condenser,http://www.reuters.com//article/utilities-operations-entergy-pilgrim-idUSL2N0MG0SD20140319?type=companyNews

2,"  June 24 The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said on Tuesday that after a series of investigations, it has declared a 2013 incident at an Arkansas nuclear power plant to be of substantial safety significance, the penultimate of four emergency classifications.An industrial accident at Entergy Corp's Arkansas Nuclear One plant in Russellville killed one worker and injured eight others on March 31 last year, when a generator fell as it was being moved out of the turbine building.The accident was initially classified as an unusual event, the lowest of four emergency classifications, because the incident caused a small explosion inside electrical cabinets.The incident caused unit 2 of the plant to automatically shut down when a reactor coolant pump tripped due to vibrations caused by the heavy component hitting the turbine building floor, damaging electrical cables and equipment, leading to a loss of off-site power. Unit 1 at the plant was in a refueling outage at the time, with all of the fuel still in the reactor vessel, safely cooled.Emergency diesel generators were relied upon for six days to supply power to cooling systems. If the diesel generators would have failed, there was no alternate means of providing electrical power to key safety-related systems at the plant at that time, due to the damaged electrical cables and equipment. ""The NRC determined that the lifting assembly collapse resulted from the plant's failure to adequately review the assembly design and ensure an appropriate load test in accordance with its procedures or approved standards,"" the NRC statement said.NRC held a regulatory conference with Entergy officials on May 1 and after considering information provided by Entergy, determined that 'substantial safety significance' was appropriate to characterize the risk significance of the event for both Unit 1 and 2.""The NRC will determine the appropriate level of agency oversight and notify Entergy officials of the decision in a separate letter,"" the statement said.

4,"  July 17 The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday sued Entergy Corp, accusing the utility owner and power producer of refusing to show that it complies with rules governing affirmative action, a requirement for federal contractors.According to a complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in New Orleans, Entergy has since May 2012 refused repeated requests from the Labor Department to submit its written affirmative action programs and related records, in connection with a routine compliance review of 11 properties in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas.The Justice Department said Entergy, as a federal contractor, cannot discriminate against employees and job applicants on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, disability or protected veteran status.It estimated that Entergy earns more than $1 billion in taxpayer-funded contracts to provide services to the government. Entergy's failure to make the disclosures ""undermines the public trust that taxpayers expect in ensuring that public funding is used in a manner that complies with both federal law and agency regulations,"" Jocelyn Samuels, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's civil rights unit, said in a statement. Michael Burns, an Entergy spokesman, said the New Orleans-based company does not discuss pending litigation.The lawsuit seeks a permanent injunction requiring Entergy to turn over required materials. Entergy said it employs roughly 14,000 people, has electric power businesses in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, and operates six nuclear power plants.The case is U.S. v. Entergy Corp et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana, No. 14-01644.

10,"  A judge in New York has ruled Entergy Corp cannot stop hearings on the state's plan to shut the company's Indian Point nuclear power plant for part of the summer to protect fish in the Hudson River.In a ruling late Tuesday, an administrative law judge at the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) rejected Entergy's latest attempt to stop the state from shutting the plant, at least for part of the summer.The ruling was the latest salvo in an eight-year battle between Entergy, which wants to run Indian Point for another 20 years, and the state, which wants the plant shut.The 2,061-megawatt plant, located about 40 miles north of Manhattan, provides about a quarter of the power used in the New York City area.The state's power grid operator and local utilities have said the shutdown of the plant could threaten the reliability of the power grid and boost prices in the Big Apple.The judge, Maria Villa, made the ruling on Entergy's attempt to quash the DEC's 2013 proposal that Indian Point shut for at least 42 days each year, between May 10 and Aug. 10, during prime fish migrations. That is also the time of year Indian Point produces much of its revenue because power prices are generally highest when air conditioning demand peaks during the summer.""The rulings provide for evidentiary hearings on DEC staff's proposal ... Entergy will participate fully in such hearings even as we preserve our position that they are unnecessary,"" the company said. The hearings are expected to continue through 2015.Indian Point withdraws up to 2.5 billion gallons of water a day from the Hudson to cool equipment, and then discharges it back into the river a little warmer than before.Environmental groups and the DEC have long argued Indian Point's water intake system kills about a billion fish, fish eggs and larvae each year, and that the plant should install cooling towers to reduce the use of river water by recycling it. Entergy said cooling towers are too expensive, with an estimated cost of up to $2 billion and could not enter service before 2029. Instead, it has proposed installing a Wedgewire screen system to protect fish.The company said the screens would save more fish as it would take only about three years to install at a cost of up to $250 million.

13,"  NEW YORK May 9 A transformer fire at the Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York state on Saturday has been extinguished with no damage to the reactor, a spokesman for operator Entergy Corp said.The fire, which occurred at around 6 p.m. EDT (2200 GMT), triggered the closure of the plant's Unit 3 reactor, but the other Unit 2 continues to operate, Jerry Nappi told Reuters. He said there was no information yet as to what caused the transformer failure.  The fire was put out by the sprinkler system at the transformer and on-site personnel, he said. The transformers are located around 300-400 feet (90-120 meters) away from the reactor.

14,"  May 8 Entergy Corp said Monday Indian Point 3 nuclear power reactor in New York could return to service in a few weeks after shutting Saturday due to a transformer fire.""Transformer failure replacements typically last on the order of a few weeks rather than a few days,"" Entergy spokesman Jerry Nappi said.He could not say exactly when the 1,031-megawatt unit would return since the company was still investigating the cause of the transformer failure.Indian Point is located along the Hudson River about 45 miles (72 km) north of Manhattan. Unit 2 at the site continued to operate at full power.Nappi said the company does have a spare transformer at the site. Electricity traders noted that should help speed up the amount of time it takes to replace the damaged transformer. ""Having a transformer on site is a big deal since they don't have to waste time looking for another transformer and transport it to the plant,"" a trader who worked at nuclear plants said, noting it usually takes about 10 days to replace a transformer.The damaged transformer is about the size of a small house.The fire occurred a couple days after the unit shut to fix a steam leak. This was the third failure of a main transformer at Indian Point over the past eight years. The NRC said main transformers have exploded at Unit 2 in November 2010 and at Unit 3 in April 2007.Entergy said the incident on Saturday did not cause any injuries to workers or harm to the public and there was no release of radiation. Some oil however did escape from a crack in the transformer and leaked into the Hudson River. Entergy set up booms to contain the oil and hired a contractor to clean up the spill.Nappi could not say how much oil leaked into the river, noting, ""We have an obligation to be as precise as possible before estimating what may or may not have been released to the water.""""There is little to no evidence of any environmental consequence whatsoever on the river as a result of this transformer failure,"" he said.There is a moat around the transformers to catch oil that may spill but the combination of oil from the transformer and water and foam used to put out the fire filled the moat, allowing some of the liquids to reach the river.

17,"   By Harshith Aranya  The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it would increase oversight on Entergy Corp's 685-megawatt nuclear power plant in Massachusetts for violations related to unplanned shutdowns in 2013 and 2015. The action follows an inspection of the plant during a shutdown during a storm last January, which found that Entergy could have prevented an issue related to safety relief valves if it had fixed a problem that led to the failure of a valve during a plant shutdown in February 2013. ""The NRC will determine the need for additional regulatory action and the extent of equipment, human performance and procedure quality issues that have contributed to or complicated the unplanned shutdowns in 2013 and 2015,"" the NRC's Region I administrator, Dan Dorman, said in the statement, issued on Wednesday. The violations were considered to be of low-to-moderate safety significance, the agency said.",2015-09-04,ETR,"Thu Sep 3, 2015 | 8:24pm EDT",US regulator to tighten oversight on Entergy's Massachusetts plant,http://www.reuters.com//article/utilities-operations-entergy-pilgrim-idUSL1N11A00T20150904?type=companyNews
18,"  (Adds link to table, details on reasons for Pilgrim shutdown)Oct 13 Entergy Corp said Tuesday it will close its Pilgrim nuclear power plant in Massachusetts no later than June 1, 2019, because of poor market conditions, reduced revenues and increased operational costs.""Market conditions and increased costs led us to reluctantly conclude that we had no option other than to shut down the plant,"" Leo Denault, Entergy's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a press release.The 680-megawatt Pilgrim reactor entered service in 1972 and can power more than 600,000 homes.Entergy's nuclear woes are not unique to Pilgrim. Many other U.S. nuclear plants also face potential shutdown over the next several years for economic reasons primarily related to low natural gas and power prices.For a table on other reactors in danger of closing, see: The exact timing of the Pilgrim shutdown depends on several factors and will be decided in the first half of 2016, Entergy said.Entergy said the decision to close Pilgrim was based on a number of financial factors, including low current and forecast wholesale energy prices brought about by record low gas prices, driven by shale gas production, which significantly impacted Pilgrim's revenues. The company said Pilgrim was expected to incur annual after-tax net losses on an operational basis ranging from about $10 million to $30 million for 2015, 2016 and 2017.Power prices in New England have averaged $54 per megawatt since the start of 2015. That was down from $76 in 2014 and a five-year (2010-2014) average of $58.Entergy also blamed Pilgrim's problems on wholesale power market design flaws that continue to suppress energy and capacity prices in the region that do not provide adequate compensation to merchant nuclear plants for the benefits they provide. Those benefits include reliable carbon-free, large-scale energy generation 24 hours a day and seven days a week and onsite fuel storage, Entergy said.""Efforts over the past few years to correct these market design flaws have not been sufficiently successful,"" the company said.In addition, Entergy, like other nuclear operators, said Pilgrim's economic performance was undermined by unfavorable state energy proposals that subsidize renewable energy resources and a state proposal to provide above-market prices to utilities in Canada for hydro power.Entergy said it has about $870 million in the plant's decommissioning fund as of Sept. 30. No additional funding is anticipated at this time.

21,"  Jan 22 - Entergy Corp asked a U.S. federal district court last week to reject New York State's objection to the coastal certification of the Indian Point nuclear power plant.The following is a timeline on Entergy's efforts to relicense the two reactors at Indian Point for another 20 years:December 2015 - Indian Point 3 license expires. The plant can continue to run so long as the relicensing process is ongoing.December 2015 - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo directed state energy regulators to develop a process to prevent the premature retirement of Upstate nuclear power plants. At the same time however, he opposed the continued operation of Indian Point because he does not believe the area around the plant, located about 40 miles north of New York City, can be safely evacuated if there is a problem.November 2015 - New York Department of State (NYDOS) objects to federal Coastal Zone Management Act certification for Indian Point. The objection, unless overturned by a court or the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, would prohibit the NRC from renewing the plant's operating licenses.November 2015 - New York State asks NRC to deny Entergy's application to relicense the two reactors at Indian Point.November 2015 - Entergy says it will shut the FitzPatrick reactor in Upstate New York by early 2017 due primarily to weak power market conditions brought about by low natural gas prices from shale formations. Unlike his opposition to the continued operation of Indian Point, Cuomo opposed the planned shutdown of FitzPatrick.October 2015 - Entergy said it would shut the Pilgrim reactor in Massachusetts by June 2019 due primarily to similar weak market conditions harming FitzPatrick.December 2014 - New York State appeals court finds Indian Point is exempt from review under the New York Coastal Zone Management Program under a grandfathering clause. The decision overturned previous decisions by the state's Supreme Court, the trial court in New York, and a regulatory decision by the NYDOS. December 2014 - After winning a long relicensing battle with the state of Vermont, Entergy shuts the Vermont Yankee nuclear reactor due mostly to weak market conditions.2014 - Entergy says it could take the NRC until 2017 or 2018 to complete the Indian Point relicensing process. Some analysts have suggested Entergy could strike a deal with New York that would allow the reactors to obtain the 20-year license renewal but shut sometime before the licenses expire to overcome NYDEC concerns about fish kills. That would be similar to Exelon Corp's deal with New Jersey on the Oyster Creek nuclear reactor.2013 - Entergy wins on eight of nine contentions against the relicensing before NRC's Atomic Safety Licensing Board (ASLB). The losing contention concerns transformers, which Entergy said it would fix. The ASLB, which allowed other contentions since 2012, had at least six other contentions to hear before providing a recommendation on whether to approve Entergy's relicensing application to the NRC commission.September 2013 - Unit 2 license expired. The unit can continue operating so long as the relicensing process is ongoing. 2013-14 - NYDEC proposes Entergy shut Indian Point reactors for an average of 42 days during summer instead of installing cooling towers to protect fish to qualify for the State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System and Water Quality Certificate, which the plant needs to continue operating.2012 - NRC ASLB holds hearings on 10 contentions from environmental groups and New York State opposed to the relicensing. With so many contentions, the NRC cannot say when the Commission will make a final decision on relicensing.2011 - Andrew Cuomo becomes governor of New York. He opposes the continued operation of Indian Point.2010 - NYDEC denies Indian Point Water Quality Certificate because it believes the plant violates the federal Clean Water Act and wants Entergy to install a closed loop cooling system like cooling towers. Entergy has argued before an administrative law judge and others at the NYDEC that cooling towers would cost up to $2 billion and could not be built before 2029. Instead, Entergy wants to install a $200 to $250 million Wedgewire screen system that would protect more fish because it could be installed in about three years. 2009 - Entergy files with NYDEC for a 20-year Water Quality Certificate that is required before the NRC can relicense the reactors.2007 - Entergy files with NRC to renew both unit's 40-year operating licenses for an additional 20 years.2003 - NYDEC determined Indian Point will have to do more to reduce the impact of the plant's cooling water intake system on aquatic organisms. Indian Point withdraws up to 2.5 billion gallons of water a day from the Hudson River. The state and environmental groups have said the cooling system kills over a billion fish, fish eggs and larvae each year.

31,"  May 5 - The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) told its staff to re-evaluate aspects of a severe accident mitigation analysis as part of Entergy Corp's application to renew the licenses for the Indian Point nuclear power plant in New York.The move by the commissioners on Wednesday reverses an earlier ruling by the NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) in 2013.The commission made its decision after New York State sought review of the ASLB decision, according to World Nuclear News, a publication supported by the World Nuclear Association, an international nuclear trade group.See: hereA spokesman at Indian Point said the review is expected to lengthen the license renewal review process, but noted that the power plant will continue to operate under existing licenses until the NRC makes a final decision on the application.""This issue is an assessment of the economics of Indian Point, not an evaluation of its safety,"" Jerry Nappi, spokesman for Indian Point, said in an email.Entergy is seeking a 20-year license renewal for Indian Point. The plant is located about 40 miles north of Manhattan in the town of Buchanan on the shores of the Hudson River.To relicense the plant's two reactors, Entergy is seeking three things.1 - The federal operating license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).2 - A water permit from the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYDEC).3 - A Coastal Zone Management certification from the New York Department of State (NYDOS).The following is a timeline on Entergy's efforts to relicense the two reactors at Indian Point for another 20 years:May 2016 - NRC commissioners told the NRC staff to re-evaluate aspects of a severe accident mitigation analysis as part of Entergy's application to renew the licenses for Indian Point.February 2016 - Entergy reports tritium leak at the plant.January 2016 - Entergy asks U.S. federal district court to reject the NYDOS' objection to the plant's Coastal Zone Management Act certification.December 2015 - Indian Point 3 license expires. The plant can continue to run so long as the relicensing process is ongoing. December 2015 - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo directed state energy regulators to develop a process to prevent the premature retirement of Upstate nuclear power plants. At the same time however, he opposed the continued operation of Indian Point because he does not believe the area around the plant, located about 40 miles north of New York City, can be safely evacuated if there is a problem.November 2015 - NYDOS objects to federal Coastal Zone Management Act certification for Indian Point. The objection, unless overturned by a court or the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, would prohibit the NRC from renewing the plant's operating licenses.November 2015 - New York State asks NRC to deny Entergy's application to relicense the two reactors at Indian Point.November 2015 - Entergy says it will shut the FitzPatrick reactor in Upstate New York by early 2017 due primarily to weak power market conditions brought about by low natural gas prices from shale formations. Unlike his opposition to the continued operation of Indian Point, Cuomo opposed the planned shutdown of FitzPatrick.October 2015 - Entergy said it would shut the Pilgrim reactor in Massachusetts by June 2019 due primarily to similar weak market conditions harming FitzPatrick. December 2014 - New York State appeals court finds Indian Point is exempt from review under the New York Coastal Zone Management Program under a grandfathering clause. The decision overturned previous decisions by the state's Supreme Court, the trial court in New York, and a regulatory decision by the NYDOS.December 2014 - After winning a long relicensing battle with the state of Vermont, Entergy shuts the Vermont Yankee nuclear reactor due mostly to weak market conditions.2014 - Entergy says it could take the NRC until 2017 or 2018 to complete the Indian Point relicensing process. Some analysts have suggested Entergy could strike a deal with New York that would allow the reactors to obtain the 20-year license renewal but shut sometime before the licenses expire to overcome NYDEC concerns about fish kills. That would be similar to Exelon Corp's deal with New Jersey on the Oyster Creek nuclear reactor.2013 - Entergy wins on eight of nine contentions against the relicensing before NRC's Atomic Safety Licensing Board (ASLB). The losing contention concerns transformers, which Entergy said it would fix. The ASLB, which allowed other contentions since 2012, had at least six other contentions to hear before providing a recommendation on whether to approve Entergy's relicensing application to the NRC commission.September 2013 - Unit 2 license expired. The unit can continue operating so long as the relicensing process is ongoing.2013-14 - NYDEC proposes Entergy shut Indian Point reactors for an average of 42 days during summer instead of installing cooling towers to protect fish to qualify for the State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System and Water Quality Certificate, which the plant needs to continue operating. 2012 - NRC ASLB holds hearings on 10 contentions from environmental groups and New York State opposed to the relicensing. With so many contentions, the NRC cannot say when the Commission will make a final decision on relicensing.2011 - Andrew Cuomo becomes governor of New York. He opposes the continued operation of Indian Point.2010 - NYDEC denies Indian Point Water Quality Certificate because it believes the plant violates the federal Clean Water Act and wants Entergy to install a closed loop cooling system like cooling towers. Entergy has argued before an administrative law judge and others at the NYDEC that cooling towers would cost up to $2 billion and could not be built before 2029. Instead, Entergy wants to install a $200 to $250 million Wedgewire screen system that would protect more fish because it could be installed in about three years.2009 - Entergy files with NYDEC for a 20-year Water Quality Certificate that is required before the NRC can relicense the reactors.2007 - Entergy files with NRC to renew both unit's 40-year operating licenses for an additional 20 years.2003 - NYDEC determined Indian Point will have to do more to reduce the impact of the plant's cooling water intake system on aquatic organisms. Indian Point withdraws up to 2.5 billion gallons of water a day from the Hudson River. The state and environmental groups have said the cooling system kills over a billion fish, fish eggs and larvae each year. Entergy has been seeking the State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System from the NYDEC ever since.2001 - Entergy buys Indian Point Unit 2 from Consolidated Edison Inc for $502 million plus about $100 million for the fuel.2000 - Entergy buys Indian Point Unit 3 and the FitzPatrick reactors from New York Power Authority (NYPA) for $967 million.1992 - Indian Point owners file with NYDEC to renew the plant's State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit.1976 - Unit 3 enters commercial service.1974 - Unit 2 enters commercial service.1974 - Con Edison shuts Unit 1.1974 - To help Con Edison weather the financial crisis after the 1973 OPEC oil embargo, New York State ordered the state-owned NYPA to buy and complete a couple of power plants Con Edison was building at the time, including Unit 3 at Indian Point.1962 - Con Edison gets operating license for the 275-MW Unit 1, a pressurized water reactor.

35,"  July 19 - Administrative Law Judges at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave parties opposed to the relicensing of Entergy Corp's Indian Point nuclear power plant until March 2017 to file papers in response to a bolt issue at the plant.In March 2016, Entergy told the NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) that a quarter of the baffle bolts in the reactor showed signs of degradation, according to an NRC filing. The bolts hold together plates in the reactor.Due to the bolt issue, the ASLB gave Entergy more time to come up with a plan to keep the bolts in working order over the long-term, and gave the parties opposed to the relicensing, the state of New York and the Riverkeeper environmental group, more time to review Entergy's findings and respond to them.The review is likely to lengthen the license renewal process, which started in 2007 and is already the longest in U.S. history.Entergy is seeking a 20-year license renewal for Indian Point.

Some analysts have suggested Entergy could strike a deal with New York that would allow the reactors to obtain the 20-year license renewal but shut sometime before the licenses expire to overcome NYDEC concerns about fish kills. That would be similar to Exelon Corp's deal with New Jersey on the Oyster Creek nuclear reactor.2013 - Entergy wins on eight of nine contentions against the relicensing before NRC's Atomic Safety Licensing Board (ASLB). The losing contention concerns transformers, which Entergy said it would fix. The ASLB, which allowed other contentions since 2012, had at least six other contentions to hear before providing a recommendation on whether to approve Entergy's relicensing application to the NRC commission.September 2013 - Unit 2 license expired. The unit can continue operating so long as the relicensing process is ongoing.2013-14 - NYDEC proposes Entergy shut Indian Point reactors for an average of 42 days during summer instead of installing cooling towers to protect fish to qualify for the State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System and Water Quality Certificate, which the plant needs to continue operating. 2012 - NRC ASLB holds hearings on 10 contentions from environmental groups and New York State opposed to the relicensing. With so many contentions, the NRC cannot say when the Commission will make a final decision on relicensing.2011 - Andrew Cuomo becomes governor of New York. He opposes the continued operation of Indian Point.2010 - NYDEC denies Indian Point Water Quality Certificate because it believes the plant violates the federal Clean Water Act and wants Entergy to install a closed loop cooling system like cooling towers. Entergy has argued before an administrative law judge and others at the NYDEC that cooling towers would cost up to $2 billion and could not be built before 2029. Instead, Entergy wants to install a $200 to $250 million Wedgewire screen system that would protect more fish because it could be installed in about three years.2009 - Entergy files with NYDEC for a 20-year Water Quality Certificate that is required before the NRC can relicense the reactors.2007 - Entergy files with NRC to renew both unit's 40-year operating licenses for an additional 20 years.2003 - NYDEC determined Indian Point will have to do more to reduce the impact of the plant's cooling water intake system on aquatic organisms. Indian Point withdraws up to 2.5 billion gallons of water a day from the Hudson River.

47,"  Nov 23 - Entergy Corp said on Wednesday it will pursue various options to renew licenses to operate its Indian Point nuclear power plant for another two decades after New York's highest court ruled against the company this week.On Monday, the New York Court of Appeals ruled that the New York State Department of State (NYSDOS) has the right to review Indian Point's Coastal Zone Management application.The NYSDOS objected to Entergy's coastal zone management certification in November 2015. Entergy needs the Coastal Zone Management certificate as part of its federal application to relicense the two Indian Point reactors.Entergy, however, said it withdrew its coastal zone management certification from NYSDOS review in 2014 before the agency objected to its application, so the state's ruling could not hold.If that withdrawal was not valid, Entergy said the company has the right to appeal to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce. If that withdrawal was valid, the company said it can file a new application.Separately, Entergy said its lawsuit filed in federal court in January 2016 related to the NYSDOS objection was still pending. Entergy argued that the NYSDOS objection was based on nuclear safety concerns, which are a federal and not a state issue.Entergy is seeking a 20-year license renewal for Indian Point. The plant is located about 40 miles north of Manhattan in the town of Buchanan on the shores of the Hudson River.To relicense the plant's two reactors, Entergy is seeking three things.1 - The federal operating license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).2 - A water permit from the New York Department of Environmental Conservation (NYDEC).3 - A Coastal Zone Management certification from the New York State Department of State (NYSDOS).The following is a timeline on Entergy's efforts to relicense the two reactors at Indian Point for another 20 years:November 2016 - The New York Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state, ruled on Monday that the NYSDOS has the right to review Indian Point's Coastal Zone Management application.July 2016 - NRC ASLB gives the parties opposed to the relicesing of Indian Point until March 2017 to respond to whatever Entergy finds in its analysis of problems with bolts in the reactor.May 2016 - NRC commissioners told the NRC staff to re-evaluate aspects of a severe accident mitigation analysis as part of Entergy's application to renew the licenses for Indian Point.February 2016 - Entergy reports tritium leak at the plant. January 2016 - Entergy asks U.S. federal district court to reject the NYSDOS' objection to the plant's Coastal Zone Management Act certification.December 2015 - Indian Point 3 license expires. The plant can continue to run so long as the relicensing process is ongoing.December 2015 - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo directed state energy regulators to develop a process to prevent the premature retirement of Upstate nuclear power plants. At the same time however, he opposed the continued operation of Indian Point because he does not believe the area around the plant, located about 40 miles north of New York City, can be safely evacuated if there is a problem.November 2015 - NYSDOS objects to federal Coastal Zone Management Act certification for Indian Point. The objection, unless overturned by a court or the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, would prohibit the NRC from renewing the plant's operating licenses. Entergy, however, said it withdrew its certification application in 2014 so the NYSDOS had nothing to object to.November 2015 - New York State asks NRC to deny Entergy's application to relicense the two reactors at Indian Point.November 2015 - Entergy says it will shut the FitzPatrick reactor in Upstate New York by early 2017 due primarily to weak power market conditions brought about by low natural gas prices from shale formations. Unlike his opposition to the continued operation of Indian Point, Cuomo opposed the planned shutdown of FitzPatrick. October 2015 - Entergy said it would shut the Pilgrim reactor in Massachusetts by June 2019 due primarily to similar weak market conditions harming FitzPatrick.December 2014 - New York State appeals court finds Indian Point is exempt from review under the New York Coastal Zone Management Program under a grandfathering clause. The decision overturned previous decisions by the state's Supreme Court, the trial court in New York, and a regulatory decision by the NYSDOS.December 2014 - After winning a long relicensing battle with the state of Vermont, Entergy shuts the Vermont Yankee nuclear reactor due mostly to weak market conditions.2014 - Entergy says it could take the NRC until 2017 or 2018 to complete the Indian Point relicensing process.
