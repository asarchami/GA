0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 09 (Fitch) The proposal by Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:  SPG) to acquire The Macerich Company (NYSE: MAC, Macerich) for $91.00 per share  in cash and SPG shares, if consummated as proposed, would likely have negative  credit implications for SPG according to Fitch Ratings.  The proposed  transaction would increase SPG's leverage materially above the 5.1x level as of  Dec. 31, 2014 while also lowering the company's unencumbered asset coverage of  unsecured debt.  If an agreement is reached, Fitch would review revised  transaction terms, if any, and the company's ratings and Outlook.  Currently,  the company's long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'A' with a Stable  Outlook.   PROPOSED TRANSACTION  On March 9, 2015, SPG announced a proposed transaction to acquire MAC for  approximately $22.4 billion, including the assumption of MAC's approximately  $6.4 billion of debt outstanding, including MAC's pro rata share of mortgage  debt from unconsolidated entities.  SPG also reached an agreement in principle  to sell certain Macerich assets to General Growth Properties, Inc. (NYSE: GGP,  Not Rated) in connection with the closing of the acquisition. The GGP sale would  not be a condition to closing the transaction.  The proposed agreement between  SPG and GGP removes a potential bidder for MAC, thereby increasing the  probability of SPG winning MAC. However, hostile public-to-public REIT  transactions oftentimes pose challenges to the bidder by the target.  POTENTIAL CREDIT IMPLICATIONS Credit concerns inherent in the proposed transaction include a weakening of the  balance sheet as measured by net debt-to-EBITDA. Fitch's expectation of leverage  sustaining above 5.5x would be one factor inconsistent with the 'A' IDR.   Moreover, the company's unencumbered assets (based on a stressed 7%  capitalization rate) to net unsecured debt ratio of 2.6x would weaken if the MAC  transaction closes as proposed.  If consummated, Fitch anticipates that SPG  would maintain adequate liquidity and excellent access to capital. The company's  liquidity coverage ratio is 1.4x for the period Jan. 31, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016,  driven by an industry-leading revolving credit facility capacity, which will  enable the company to fund upcoming debt maturities and capital expenditures,  along with $1.3 billion of expected development costs.  Moreover, SPG's adjusted  funds from operations payout ratio was 64% during 2014; based on the current  payout ratio, the company retains over $1 billion annually in organic cash flow.  Credit positives inherent in the proposed transaction include the potential to  acquire a high-quality mall portfolio as measured by MAC's strong sales per  square foot and occupancy ratios.  Nevertheless, SPG has outperformed MAC on  both measures, with SPG's sales per square foot at $619 as of Dec. 31, 2014  compared with $587 - both high levels compared to the mall industry at large.   SPG's occupancy in its U.S. malls and Premium Outlets was 97.1% as of Dec. 31,  2014 compared with MAC at 95.8%.   SPG's average same-store net operating income (NOI) has outperformed MAC by 110  basis points from 2008-2014, which speaks to Simon's stronger property level  performance, while SPG also has materially lower general and administrative  costs as a percentage of total revenues when compared with MAC.  Therefore, SPG  has the potential to drive above-average cash flow growth if the MAC transaction  is consummated.  In addition, the proposed transaction would increase SPG's  exposure to strong demographic regions in California (29% of MAC's expected 2015  pro rata NOI), New York (18.3%) and Arizona (17%). RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x. The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (this ratio  was 3.7x in 2014); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.1x at  Dec. 31, 2014). Fitch currently rates the companies as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Long-term IDR 'A'; --$75 million preferred stock 'BBB+'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --Long-term IDR 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --$6.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities 'A'; --$240 million unsecured term loan 'A'; --$13.4 billion senior unsecured notes 'A'; --$409 million commercial paper notes 'F1'. Simon CP 2 --$409 million commercial paper notes 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

Simon, which published a presentation on Tuesday that it said showed why its proposal was compelling, declined to comment when asked about the appeal of high-end malls.Investors see upscale malls as irreplaceable assets with high barriers to entry, according to real estate research firm Green Street Advisors of Newport Beach, California. Sales are declining in lower-income malls, but increasing in higher-income centers that count Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Whole Foods Market Inc (WFM.O) and Uniqlo as tenants, with Bloomingdale's (M.N) or Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N) as anchors.

Staggered boards are also considered a powerful anti-takeover defense.With Macerich's moves, management has greater control over the real estate investment trust, making it tough for Simon Property to force a resolution, analysts say.""Unless Macerich wants to do a deal, there won't be a deal,"" said Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill + Partners LP in New York. Historically, hostile takeovers of REITs are very difficult, he said.Macerich's stock price suggests traders expect a sweetened bid.

The stock has climbed 35 percent since the day before Nov. 19, when Simon Property announced it had accumulated a 3.6 percent stake in Macerich. The governance changes Macerich implemented this week aim to give it more breathing room when it comes to assessing its options, the company's board said on Tuesday.The anti-takeover measures are not as unfriendly to shareholders as they may seem, Todd Thomas, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in a note, adding that the company could hold out for a higher offer.Simon Property's chairman and chief executive, David Simon,  is considered a savvy foe. Investors give Simon credit for being disciplined in pursuing acquisitions that make sense, while dropping a deal that is not valuable, said Paul Adornato, senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York. For example, Simon Property withdrew a $4.5 billion offer for the UK's Capital Shopping Centers in 2011 when the company refused to share information.""David Simon has shown discipline over the years in walking away when either the numbers don't make sense or the deal is dead,"" Adornato said.Sandler O'Neill's Goldfarb said Simon Property's offer of $91 a share is ""pretty healthy,"" though he recognized it could go higher.

A cap rate is determined by dividing a property's net operating income with an asset's price. Falling cap rates indicate rising values. ""While that might seem excessive, one has to keep in mind there's a lot of growth that's not yet in Macerich's numbers,"" Adornato said, referring to Macerich's acquisition of New York properties Kings Plaza in Brooklyn and Green Acres on Long Island, where a turnaround strategy has just begun.

16,"   By Herbert Lash | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Simon Property Group Inc's (SPG.N) failed bid to buy U.S. upscale shopping center operator Macerich Co (MAC.N) is unlikely to crush either company's stock price for a simple reason: No one is building any more ""Class A"" malls.Macerich late on Tuesday rejected Simon's sweetened cash-and-stock offer, which was valued at $95.50 a share, or $23.2 billion including debt. Macerich Chief Executive Officer Arthur Coppola said in a statement that the revised bid did not reflect the full value of the company, the third-largest U.S. real estate investment trust. Analysts suggested Coppola had a point because upscale malls such as Macerich's Tysons Corner Center in northern Virginia are unique assets that cannot be built as easily as hotels, apartment or office buildings.Simon's bid and Macerich's rejection underpin the value of Class A malls, said Cowen and Co analyst James Sullivan. ""They only get sold when a seller chooses to sell them,"" he said. ""Mall development just isn't happening today. That makes the ones that are in place increasingly valuable."" The uniqueness of upscale malls gives them ""fortress-like"" characteristics, as Sullivan and other REIT analysts point out. ""As we say in the real estate business, malls are not fungible,"" Sullivan said. ""You can't just turn around and build another one in the same market.""The only U.S. regional mall under construction is the International Market Place in Hawaii, a property controlled by Taubman Centers Inc (TCO.N).Macerich shares were down 5.9 percent at $79.34 in afternoon trading, while Simon rose 1.3 percent to $198.24.  MALLS VS. SHARES Upscale mall valuations are generally the highest in the real estate industry, but their operators' shares still trade at a discount to the individual assets, Sullivan said.General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N), the second-largest U.S. REIT behind Simon, sold a stake in its Ala Moana shopping center in Hawaii to Australian pension fund AustralianSuper in March at a 3.7 cap rate, Sullivan said.A cap rate is the net operating income of a property divided by its price. The lower this measure is, the higher the asset's price.  While Sullivan said Ala Moana was an exceptional asset, its cap rate suggested the better mall REITs have lower values than what their assets are selling for in the private market.To reflect a 4.0 cap rate, Macerich shares would have to rise to $115 from about $80 today, according to BMO Capital Markets analyst Paul Adornato. He said in an interview two weeks ago that Simon's first bid of $91 a share on March 9 equated to a 4.8 cap rate.Sandler O'Neil + Partners analyst Alex Goldfarb said Simon CEO David Simon would not let Macerich's rejection of his bid discourage him. The company has bid for and was rejected by Taubman Centers and General Growth in the past.Sandler O'Neil said it expected to receive or intended to seek compensation from both Macerich and Simon for investment banking services in the next three months. ""David is extremely shrewd and has run an incredible company,"" Goldfarb said. ""They'll certainly find other investment opportunities.""

25,"   By Mike Stone  Macerich Co's (MAC.N) fourth largest shareholder, Cohen & Steers Inc (CNS.N), asked the shopping mall company on Wednesday to produce a plan that will deliver as much value as the takeover offer by Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) it turned down last month.The comments, made by Cohen & Steers' Executive Chairman Martin Cohen to Reuters on the sidelines of the NYU REIT Symposium in New York, make the investment manager the largest Macerich shareholder to publicly criticize the company after it rejected a sweetened offer of $95.50 per share by Simon, equivalent to $23.2 billion including debt.""At least give us a plan of how Macerich will exceed Simon's offer over time,"" Cohen said, adding that he favored Simon's offer.A Macerich spokesman declined to comment. Cohen & Steers owns 6.35 percent of Macerich's common stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. It is one of the biggest investors in real estate investment trusts and is also a shareholder in Simon, as well as other major real estate companies such as Equity Residential (EQR.N), Vornado Realty Trust (VNO.N) and SL Green Realty Corp (SLG.N).Smaller Macerich investor, Land and Buildings Investment Management LLC, headed by activist investor Jonathan Litt, is also currently challenging Macerich with a proposal for a slate of four directors to its board. Macerich is seeking to quash Land & Buildings nominations in court, according to court documents reviewed by Reuters. Macerich's complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City states Land and Buildings was not a shareholder by March 20, the date of record when shareholders can vote in upcoming board member elections and make nominations.A merger between Indianapolis-based Simon and Santa Monica, California-based Macerich would have joined the No. 1 and No. 3 U.S. shopping mall owners. Simon argued the deal would boost their ability to negotiate leases with store owners at a time when mall operators are experiencing a fall in traffic as consumers take to shopping online, which is more convenient and often cheaper. Macerich countered that Simon's offer ""substantially"" undervalued it. It adopted a poison pill, or a shareholder rights plan, with a 10 percent trigger, and changed its board structure to thwart a hostile takeover.
