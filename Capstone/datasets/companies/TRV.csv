0,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 16 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on The  Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TRV), as follows:  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A';  --Subordinated notes at 'BBB+';  --Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) on insurance company subsidiaries at 'AA'.  See the full list of rating actions below. The Rating Outlooks are Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS TRV's ratings are supported by a strong competitive position as a top-5 U.S.  property/casualty insurer, solid earnings, prudent capital management, and  financial flexibility. Balanced against these strengths is TRV's continued  investment concentration in municipal bonds.    TRV's market position and size/scale are characterized as 'Large' by Fitch given  its nearly 5% market share of the property/casualty industry measured by net  written premium.  The company offers a wide range of insurance products to both  the commercial and personal lines markets and frequently occupies a top-tier  position among independent insurance agencies. TRV's combined ratio was 90.6% for the first three quarters of 2013, leading to  a 15.6% annualized return on stockholders' equity (ROE).  The combined ratio and  ROE averaged 95.3% and 12.5%, respectively, over the five-year period 2008-2012.  Profitability benefited from a benign catastrophe year in 2013 relative to 2012,  which included losses from Superstorm Sandy in the fourth quarter. Capitalization at the operating company level scored 'Very Strong' on Fitch's  proprietary capital model, Prism, which is considered consistent with TRV's 'AA'  IFS rating.  Other measures of capital strength such as operating leverage and  net leverage ratios were, respectively, 1.1x and 3.5x as of Sept. 30, 2013, and  are at median guidelines for the current rating category.  Fitch estimates TRV's  NAIC risk-based capital (RBC) to be 277% of the company action level at Sept.  30, 2013. TRV's debt-to-capital ratio was 21% at Sept. 30, 2013, which is within  management's stated target range of 15%-25%.  Operating EBIT covered fixed  charges by nearly 15x during the first nine months of 2013, which is at the  upper end of the range for Fitch's median guidelines for the current rating  category. The next significant debt maturity is $400 million of senior debt in  December 2015.   TRV repurchased 17 million common shares year-to-date Sept. 30, 2013. The  average price per share repurchased was $82 and the total amount spent on  repurchases was $1.4 billion, which represented slightly more than one-half of  net income over the period. TRV's board of directors authorized a $5 billion  share repurchase authorization at the close of the third quarter 2013.  TRV has maintained significant holding company liquidity with cash, short-term  invested assets and other readily marketable securities totaling $1.9 billion at  Sept. 30, 2013.  One year's interest expense and common dividends is estimated  to be $1.1 billion.  TRV's liquidity profile is supplemented by an $800 million  commercial paper (CP) program that is backed by a three-year $1 billion  syndicated credit facility. The company carries a large investment allocation in state, municipal and  revenue bonds, amounting to $36 billion or 58% of fixed-income securities as of  Sept. 30, 2013.  This asset class is experiencing a heightened level of stress  given the fiscal problems of many states and municipalities.  Concerns over the  municipal portfolio are largely mitigated by its diversification, high credit  quality and $1.6 billion unrealized gain as of Sept. 30, 2013. In addition,  greater than one-quarter of TRV's municipal bonds are 'prefunded', meaning there  is an escrow to fund repayment, significantly reducing credit risk.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: --Capitalization at the underwriting subsidiaries that is inconsistent with  standards for the current rating category such as consolidated statutory net  leverage greater than 4.5x, a long-term increase in the financial leverage ratio  to greater than 25% or a deterioration in the Prism score to below the 'Very  Strong' category. --A GAAP fixed-charge coverage ratio less than 8x on a run-rate basis;  --A sustained period of net losses or catastrophe losses out of proportion with  the company's market share.  Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include:       --Improvement in TRV's capitalization measured by a Prism score of 'Extremely  Strong'. However, given publicly traded companies' sensitivity around managing  capital, this level of overcapitalization is unlikely.  --Sustained underwriting performance across business lines that is clearly  better than the industry and similarly-rated peers.

6,"  * Dow Chemical jumps on Third Point stake* Verizon, Travelers, JNJ fall after results* 70 S&P 500 companies to report earnings this week* Indexes: Dow off 0.30 pct, S&P up 0.14 pct, Nasdaq up 0.31 pctBy Chuck MikolajczakNEW YORK, Jan 21 U.S. stocks edged higher on Tuesday, putting the S&P on pace to snap a two-session decline, as gains in the materials sector were offset by declines in a trio of Dow components.The S&P materials index gained 0.9 percent as the  best performing of the 10 major S&P indexes, led by a 4.9 percent gain in Dow Chemical to $45.18. Activist investor and hedge fund manager Daniel Loeb has taken a stake in the company and wants it to spin off its petrochemical arm.""Dow Chemical is kind of behind sort of a broader market rise with the idea there is still value, or at least one respected hedge fund thinks there is still some value in a specific stock,"" said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. Also adding support to the materials sector was Alcoa Inc , which advanced 4.8 percent to $11.90 after JP Morgan upgraded the stock to an ""overweight"" from a neutral"" rating and boosted its price target to $15 from $9 per share.But three Dow components fell after reporting earnings, giving back advances made before the opening bell.Travelers Cos Inc lost 2 percent to $84.75 after the insurance provider posted a more than three-fold rise in fourth-quarter profit. Fellow Dow components Verizon Communications Inc fell 1.6 percent to $47.58 and Johnson & Johnson lost 2.2 percent to $92.97 as the biggest drag on the S&P 500.""There is some legitimate concern for investors that good news is factored into existing prices.

14,"  (Adds Travelers, lawyer's comments)By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK, July 22 A federal appeals court ordered Travelers Cos Inc to pay more than $500 million to thousands of asbestos victims in a case stemming from the insurer's coverage of Johns-Manville Corp, an insulation maker that spent six years in bankruptcy during the 1980s.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York reversed a February 2012 ruling in which U.S. District Judge John Koeltl said conditions under three settlement agreements in 2004 that required Travelers to make the payment had not been satisfied.Writing for a three-judge appeals court panel on Tuesday, Circuit Judge Ralph Winter said Koeltl's interpretation ""could not reasonably have been intended by the parties, whatever Travelers' private hopes and dreams, and is not supported by the language of the agreements.""The 2nd Circuit ordered the reinstatement of a 2011 ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, who oversaw Johns-Manville's bankruptcy, that Travelers make payments required under the 2004 agreements, plus $65 million of interest. Koeltl had reversed that ruling. Lifland died in January. Patrick Linehan, a Travelers spokesman, said the insurer is reviewing Tuesday's decision, and has set aside reserves to cover the entire payout, apart from interest payments.Many companies had stopped using asbestos for fireproofing and insulation by the mid-1970s after it was linked to cancer and other diseases. Litigation persists because the effects of exposure can take decades to surface.Now owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc , Johns-Manville had from the 1920s to 1970s been the largest U.S. maker of products containing asbestos. It filed for bankruptcy protection in 1982 under the weight of asbestos litigation, and settled various claims in 1986. Johns-Manville emerged from Chapter 11 in 1988.The 2nd Circuit rejected Travelers' contention that it need not pay claimants in light of a June 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision that limited claims against the insurer, and a separate decision by the 2nd Circuit the following March. It also said Travelers had waived potential objections to the payment.""Obviously, we're gratified,"" said Ronald Barliant, a partner at Goldberg Kohn in Chicago who represents about 1,600 claimants. ""Payments should have been made five years ago."" Sander Esserman, a partner at Stutzman, Bromberg, Esserman & Plifka in Dallas representing other claimants, said he looks forward to Travelers ""paying the thousands of plaintiffs who are owed money.""Paul Clement, a partner at Bancroft PLLC who represents other claimants, was not immediately available for comment.The 2nd Circuit heard oral arguments in January 2013.Separately, Travelers on Tuesday posted a larger-than-expected 26 percent drop in second-quarter profit, as hail and windstorms boosted catastrophe-related losses.  Its shares fell as much as 5.1 percent by early afternoon.The case is Common Law Settlement Counsel et al v.

Up to Monday's close, the stock had risen 10.75 percent since it last reported results in April.But Fishman did not rule out the possibility of premium rate increases in certain businesses.

The stock was the second biggest drag on the index.Investment income at insurers has been falling for the past few years as the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at historical low levels since the financial crisis. The steep fall in oil prices since June also hit the company's investments in the energy industry made through private equity funds.Energy-related private equity funds produced negative net investment income of $21 million after-tax, a company executive said on a post-earnings call.Pretax net investment income, which accounts for nearly a half of the insurer's operating profit, fell nearly 20 percent to $592 million in the first quarter. Fixed-income investments will lose about $30 million on a quarterly basis for the remainder of 2015, the company said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.""A flat top line coupled with a lot of moving parts in their investment business have made investors a little leery,"" S&P Capital IQ analyst Cathy Seifert said.Travelers' net income fell to $833 million, or $2.55 per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $1.05 billion, or $2.95 per share, a year earlier.On an operating basis, Travelers earned $2.53 per share, narrowly missing analysts' estimate of $2.54 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Travelers is one of the first U.S. insurers to report quarterly results and is thus seen as a bellwether for the industry.The company's combined ratio, the percentage of premium revenue an insurer has to pay out in claims, rose to 90.3 percent in the quarter from 88.2 percent a year earlier. A combined ratio of under 100 indicates an underwriting profit.Pretax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, rose to $162 million from $149 million while underwriting gains fell 21.6 percent to $620 million.The company said it will buy back an additional $5 billion shares and raised its quarterly cash dividend to 61 cents per share from 55 cents.Travelers' shares were at $103.25 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.(Reporting by Avik Das in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",2015-04-21,TRV,"Tue Apr 21, 2015 | 12:12pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Travelers profit misses estimates as investment income falls,http://www.reuters.com//article/travelers-results-idUSL4N0XI4AH20150421?type=companyNews

29,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, June 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on The Travelers  Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TRV) as follows:  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A';  --Subordinated notes at 'BBB+';  --Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) on insurance company subsidiaries at 'AA'.  A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. The Rating  Outlooks are Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS TRV's ratings are supported by a strong competitive position as a top six U.S.  property/casualty insurer, an adequate reserve position, prudent capital  management, a history of solid earnings and financial flexibility.   TRV's market position and size/scale is characterized as 'Large' by Fitch given  its greater than 4% market share of the property/casualty industry measured by  net written premium. The company offers a wide range of insurance products to  both the commercial and personal lines markets and frequently occupies a top  tier position among independent insurance agencies. Capitalization at the operating company level scored 'Very Strong' on Fitch's  proprietary capital model, Prism, which is considered consistent with TRV's 'AA'  Insurer Financial Strength rating. Other measures of capital strength such as  operating leverage and net leverage ratios were 1.1x and 3.7x as of year-end  2014 and are at median guidelines for the current rating category. Fitch  estimates TRV's NAIC risk-based capital (RBC) was 289% of the company action  level at year-end 2014. TRV's debt-to-capital ratio was 21.6% at March 31, 2015, remaining within  management's stated target range of 15%-25%. Operating EBIT covered fixed  charges by 14.5x times during 2014, which is at the upper end of the range for  Fitch's median guidelines for the current rating category.  TRV's underwriting and return ratios remain at the upper end of the median  guidelines for the 'AA' rating category within Fitch's sector credit factors.  The combined ratio was 88.9% during the first quarter of 2015, essentially  unchanged from 2014 at 89.0%. All three business segments, Business and  International Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance, and Personal Insurance,  reported underwriting profits and favorable prior period reserve development.  Annualized return on stockholders' equity (ROE) was 14.4% for the first quarter  of 2015, down from 15.7% for the full year 2014. Profitability is expected to  decrease in the near term as net investment income continues to be challenged in  the low interest rate environment. Fitch expects share repurchase activity to reflect underlying profitability and  not reduce Travelers' capital strength. TRV repurchased 35.8 million common  shares during 2014 at a total cost of $3.3 billion. During the first three  months of 2015 TRV repurchased 6.3 million common shares at an average price of  $107 for a total cost of $672 million. At the close of the first quarter 2015  TRV's board of directors authorized a $5 billion share repurchase program in  addition to the $884 million remaining under the previous share repurchase  program. TRV has maintained significant holding company liquidity with $1.7 billion in  cash, short-term invested assets and other readily marketable securities at  March 31, 2015 compared to an estimation of one year's interest expense and  common dividends of $1.1 billion. TRV's liquidity profile is supplemented by an  $800 million commercial paper program that is backed by a $1 billion syndicated  credit facility that expires on June 7, 2018. During 2015, a maximum of $3.25  billion in dividends are available from TRV's underwriting subsidiaries without  the prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: --Capitalization at the underwriting subsidiaries that is inconsistent with  standards for the current rating category such as consolidated statutory net  leverage greater than 4.5x, a long-term increase in the financial leverage ratio  to greater than 25% or a deterioration in the Prism score to below the 'Very  Strong' category. --A GAAP fixed charge coverage ratio less than 8x on a run rate basis.  --A sustained period of net losses or catastrophe losses out of proportion with  the company's market share.  Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include:     --Improvement in TRV's capitalization measured by a Prism score of 'Extremely  Strong'. However, given publicly traded companies' sensitivity around managing  capital, this level of overcapitalization is unlikely.  --Sustained underwriting performance across business lines that is clearly  better than the industry and similarly-rated peers. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following rating: --American Equity Insurance Company IFS 'AA'. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  The Travelers Companies, Inc. --IDR at 'A+'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'  --5.50% senior notes due Dec. 1, 2015 at 'A'; --6.25% senior notes due June 20, 2016 at 'A'; --5.75% senior notes due Dec. 15, 2017 at 'A'; --5.80% senior notes due May 15, 2018 at 'A'; --5.90% senior notes due June 2, 2019 at 'A'; --3.90% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2020 at 'A';  --6.75% senior notes due June 20, 2036 at 'A'; --6.25% senior notes due June 15, 2037 at 'A'; --5.35% senior notes due Nov. 1, 2040 at 'A'; --4.60% senior notes due Aug. 1, 2043 at 'A'; --6.25% junior subordinated debentures due March 15, 2067 at 'BBB+';  --$800 million commercial paper (CP) program at 'F1'.

Schnitzer, 49, has been with Travelers since 2007.Fishman, who has led the company since April 2004 when the St. Paul Companies Inc merged with Travelers Property Casualty Corp, said he could be dealing with a variant of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly called Lou Gehrig's disease.

41,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on The  Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE: TRV), as follows:  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'A';  --Subordinated notes at 'BBB+';  --Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) on insurance company subsidiaries at 'AA'.  See the full list of rating actions below. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS TRV's ratings are supported by a top-tier competitive position in the U.S.  property/casualty insurance market, prudent capital management, a solid reserve  position, a history of strong earnings and good financial flexibility.    Fitch views the company's market position and size/scale as 'Large' and notes  that companies with this profile are typically rated in the 'AA' category.  TRV  offers a wide range of insurance products to both the commercial and personal  lines markets and frequently occupies a top tier position among independent  insurance agencies. Capitalization at the operating company level scored 'Very Strong' on Fitch's  proprietary capital model, Prism, which is considered consistent with TRV's 'AA'  IFS rating.  Other measures of capital strength such as operating leverage and  net leverage ratios were 1.0x and 4.0x, respectively, as of Sept. 30, 2015 and  are consistent with median guidelines for the current rating category.   Fitch expects share repurchase activity to reflect underlying profitability and  will not reduce capital strength. TRV repurchased 21.5 million common shares at  a total cost of $2.2 billion during the first nine months of 2015 with $4.3  billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorization. TRV's financial leverage ratio was 22.9% at Sept. 30, 2015, remaining within  management's stated target range of 15%-25%.  Operating EBIT coverage of fixed  charges was 13.6x during the first nine months of 2015, which remains at the  upper end of Fitch's median guidelines for the current rating category.  All three business segments - Business and International Insurance, Bond &  Specialty Insurance, and Personal Insurance - reported material favorable  reserve development through the first nine months of 2015. Business and  International Insurance reported favorable development of $229 million despite  $296 million of adverse development from asbestos and environmental. TRV's  period-over-period increase in favorable reserve development was contrary to  Fitch's expectation of declining favorable development for the property/casualty  industry in general.  The combined ratio was 88.9% during the first nine months of 2015, improving  modestly from 90.3% in the comparable period of 2014.  All three business  segments reported underwriting profits and favorable prior-period reserve  development.   Annualized return on stockholders' equity (ROE) was 14.8% for the first nine  months of 2015, down from 15.7% for the full year 2014.  Profitability is  expected to be pressured in the near term as the low interest rate environment  continues to challenge net investment income. The company has maintained strong financial flexibility with $2 billion in cash,  short-term invested assets and other marketable securities at Sept. 30, 2015.   The annual estimate of holding company interest expense and common dividends was  $1.1 billion.  Proceeds from August's senior debt issuance will be used to repay  $400 million in senior notes maturing in December 2015. Fitch believes that TRV has successfully transitioned between CEOs.  On Aug. 4,  2015, the company announced its chairman and CEO, Jay Fishman, would step down  on Dec. 1, 2015 and move into the role of executive chairman.  The new CEO is  Alan Schnitzer, who has worked for TRV since 2007, and previously was the chief  executive officer of Travelers' Business and International Insurance. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could lead to a downgrade include: - Capitalization at the underwriting subsidiaries that is inconsistent with  standards for the current rating category such as consolidated statutory net  leverage greater than 4.5x, a long-term increase in the financial leverage ratio  to greater than 25% or a deterioration in the Prism score to below the 'Very  Strong' category; - A GAAP fixed-charge coverage ratio less than 8x on a run-rate basis; - A sustained period of net losses or catastrophe losses out of proportion with  the company's market share.  Key rating triggers that could lead to an upgrade include:       - Improvement in TRV's capitalization measured by a Prism score of 'Extremely  Strong'. However, given publicly traded companies' sensitivity around managing  capital, this level of overcapitalization is unlikely;  - Sustained underwriting performance across business lines that is clearly  better than the industry and similarly-rated peers.

59,"   By Dion Rabouin | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The euro fell to a four-month low against the U.S. dollar on Thursday and the greenback rose to its highest in seven months against a basket of major currencies after the European Central Bank President left the door open to more monetary stimulus.The rise in the U.S. dollar knocked down oil prices which are traded in dollars and pressured U.S. stock prices.The ECB left its ultra-loose monetary policy unchanged but President Mario Draghi kept a wide range of options open for further stimulus in December, shooting down any talk of tapering its 1.7 trillion euro asset-buying program.The U.S. dollar gained further after publication of a stronger-than-expected U.S. existing home sales report.""The move in the dollar hurt oil, which hurt energy, which hurt stocks,"" said Stephen Guilfoyle, chief market economist at Stuart Frankel & Co.Crude oil prices fell just under 2.5 percent, also weighed by profit taking. A strong rally on Wednesday had taken prices to their highest in 15 months in the wake of unexpected inventory drawdowns.U.S. stocks were also pushed lower by weak earnings reports from index heavyweights such as telephone service provider Verizon Communications Inc  and insurer Travelers Companies, Inc . Telecom stocks were the worst-performing sector, down 2 percent, their worst one-day percentage drop since Sept. 9.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 40.27 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,162.35. The S&P 500 lost 2.95 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,141.34 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.58 points, or 0.09 percent, to 5,241.83. A measure of world equity markets .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.14 percent after touching a fresh one-week high following Draghi's comments.European equities jumped following Draghi's remarks, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index rising more than 1.0 percent from its lows before closing up 0.19 percent.DRAGHI DRAGS DOWN EURO  The euro fell as low as $1.0916 versus the U.S. dollar, its lowest since June 24, helping the dollar index rise to its highest since March 10.""Draghi pushed back strongly against the idea that they could discuss tapering or adjusting QE and that weighed on the euro,"" said Vassili Serebriakov, FX strategist at Credit Agricole in New York.The ECB head's comments weighed on longer-dated U.S. Treasury prices, which dipped modestly. Benchmark 10-year notes were last down 1/32 in price to yield 1.749 percent.The greenback was also supported by relatively hawkish comments by New York Fed President William Dudley late on Wednesday. Dudley, a permanent voter on policy and a close ally of Fed Chair Janet Yellen, said the U.S. central bank would likely raise interest rates later this year if the U.S. economy remained on track.The Mexican peso fell on Thursday after touching a six-week high in the immediate aftermath of the U.S. presidential debate between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton on Wednesday.The peso is seen as the chief proxy for market pricing of the Republican candidate's chances in view of his promises to impose tough limits on immigration and rewrite trade deals.""The early polls suggest Clinton was once again the winner here and so the Mexican peso has been one of the most obvious beneficiaries,"" said James Athey, fixed income investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.""The magnitude of the move, however, suggests that the market has largely concluded that Trump won't win. That doesn't mean that the result is a foregone conclusion. Markets, pollsters and pundits all predicted the wrong result in the UK's referendum on EU membership. That should act as a cursory lesson now.""
