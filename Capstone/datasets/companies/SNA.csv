0,"  * Vows zero tolerance, says bishops will be held accountable* Six attended morning Mass, told their stories to the pope* Argentines say they are pained by not having been invited* Irish victim tells pope: ""you have the power"" to change things   (Adds comment from victims group SNAP)By Philip PullellaVATICAN CITY, July 7 Pope Francis told victims of sexual abuse by Roman Catholic clerics the Church should ""weep and make reparation"" for crimes he said had taken on the dimensions of a sacrilegious cult.""For some time now I have felt in my heart deep pain and suffering,"" he said in his strongest comments yet on the crimes, delivered in the homily of a Mass with adult victims on Monday. ""So much time hidden, camouflaged with a complicity that cannot be explained until someone realised that Jesus was looking.""He said he would not tolerate abuse by clerics, which has been exposed in recent years in many European, American and Asian dioceses. Bishops would be held accountable if they shielded them.Critics of the church's long failure to act on the cases, and of the pope's failure to meet victims earlier in his 16-month-old pontificate, said he must quickly follow up with clear action to prove the Mass was not just a ceremonial event.Francis delivered his homily to six victims of abuse, two each from Ireland, Britain and Germany, before meeting all individually at a gathering that lasted nearly four hours, spending about 30 minutes with each one.""I ask for the grace to weep, the grace for the Church to weep and make reparation for her sons and daughters who betrayed their mission, who abused innocent persons,"" he said, according to a Vatican transcript. ""Before God and his people I express my sorrow for the sins and grave crimes of clerical sexual abuse committed against you. And I humbly ask forgiveness,"" he said.Sexual abuse scandals have haunted the Catholic Church for over two decades but became a major issue in the United States about 10 years ago. Since then they have cast a shadow over local churches in Ireland, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and other countries and badly tarnished the Church's image.The meeting was closed to media but the Vatican spokesman, who participated, said it was ""very intense and moving"".""It was clearly not a public relations event. It was a very profound, spiritual encounter with a pastor, a father, who is trying to understand deeply what happened,"" Father Federico Lombardi said.The Vatican did not release the names and ages of the victims but they were believed to be in their 30s and 40s. One victim, Marie Kane, 43, of Ireland, told the Irish Times that she told the pope that ""cover-up is still happening and you have the power to make these changes"". The paper said she asked the pope to remove Cardinal Sean Brady because of his handling of an Irish abuse inquiry in 1975.Victims groups have been pressing the Vatican to hold bishops accountable if they covered up crimes. The pope addressed this directly, repeating the thrust of what he said last April in a conversation with reporters.BISHOPS TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE ""There is no place in the Church's ministry for those who commit these abuses, and I commit myself not to tolerate harm done to a minor by any individual, whether a cleric or not,"" he said. ""All bishops must carry out their pastoral ministry with the utmost care in order to help foster the protection of minors, and they will be held accountable."" Anne Barrett Doyle of BishopAccountability.org, a U.S.-based documentation centre on abuse in the Catholic Church, said the meeting was ""positive and necessary,"" even if overdue.""Now Pope Francis must internalise and personalise his point about Church leaders 'who did not respond adequately to reports of abuse',"" she said in a statement.She called on the pope to ""follow through on his promise today to discipline the many more bishops and religious superiors who even recently have enabled child sexual abuse through their negligence or deliberate cover-up"".The U.S.-based Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), said: ""Francis must take decisive action right now, action to expose and remove clerics who commit and conceal heinous crimes against the most vulnerable.""The pope told the victims he realised that they and others had suffered ""often unrelenting emotional and spiritual pain, and even despair"" and that some had turned to drugs or even taken their own lives.""The deaths of these so beloved children of God weigh upon the heart and my conscience and that of the whole Church,"" he said.Francis came under fire from victims groups for saying in an interview this year that the Church had done more than any other organisation to root out paedophiles in its ranks.Victims groups have said the pope had a spotty record of dealing with abuse cases in Argentina when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires, and victims from that country sent him a letter expressing ""pain"" that they were not invited.The Vatican says 3,420 credible accusations of sexual abuse by priests had been referred to the Vatican in the past 10 years and 824 clerics defrocked. The Church in the United States has paid $2.5 billion in compensation to victims.

1,"  BANGKOK, Aug 25 Southeast Asian stock markets rebounded on Tuesday as bargain hunting emerged in battered stocks across Asia and share buybacks by some companies helped the key stock indexes in Indonesia and Thailand regain some lost ground.     The Singapore Straits Times Index climbed 1.5 percent, recouping early losses and after dropping more than 4 percent in the previous session. Banking shares such as DBS Group Holdings led the rebound.      ""Bargain hunting and short covering buoyed blue chips and selective buying of the REITS were notable as some money managers started to nibble,"" broker NRA Capital said in a report.     Bargain hunters helped Asian stocks bounce off three-year lows, though share markets in China, epicentre of the rout, suffered another big sell-off.      In Jakarta, shares in state-controlled firms rallied after they started buying back their shares from Tuesday, led by a 7 percent surge in Semen Indonesia.      The broader stock index rose 1.6 percent after a 4 percent loss on Monday.       In Bangkok, shares of PTT Global Chemical, which hit an all-time closing low on Monday, surged almost 10 percent after the company announced a share buyback plan. The SET index  rose 1.8 percent after Monday's third straight loss.      The Philippine stock index ended up 0.6 percent after early weakness. Local investors collected beaten-down shares such as Megaworld which surged 8.4 percent, the biggest gainer.     Foreign investors continued selling shares, offloading 2.75 billion peso ($59.04 million) worth, stock exchange data showed.     Buying led by domestic institutions sent Malaysian shares  about 2 percent higher, while foreign investors sold shares worth a net 338 million ringgit ($80.28 million), stock exchange data showed.     Vietnam's benchmark VN Index ended up 0.58 percent after falling to an eight-month low the previous day.

3,"  BANGKOK, Jan 22 Southeast Asian stock markets snapped a two-day losing streak on Friday, in line with Asia, with the Philippines recovering from an oversold zone and banking shares climbing in Malaysia after a central bank move to boost liquidity in the system.     Hints of more monetary policy support by the European Central Bank and a rally in crude oil from 12-year lows lifted Asia, with MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan posting its first gain in three days.       Stocks in the Philippines led the region's rebound, with the Philippine composite index up 2 percent. Its 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) was at 33.8 at the close, bouncing off an oversold territory of below 30 on Thursday.     It dropped 3.7 percent on the week, among market laggards, along with Vietnam's 3.8 percent weekly decline.     In Kuala Lumpur, banking shares rose on optimism about liquidity outlook. Shares of CIMB Group Holdings were among outperformers with a 4.6 percent gain.     Malaysia's central bank unexpectedly cut the statutory reserve requirement ratio (SRR) to 3.5 percent effective Feb. 1 to add more liquidity into the banking system. The announcement came after market hours on Thursday. [nL3N1541M9}     The Malaysian bourse said foreign investors bought shares for the first time in twelve days worth a net 117 million ringgit ($27.25 million). The market will be closed on Monday for a public holiday, reopening on Tuesday.     Most markets in the region extended losses for a third week amid a wave of risk aversion and plunge in oil prices.

10,"   By Jeffrey Goldfarb | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Snap wants to be sure youth is not wasted on the young. The disappearing-message and picture app is preparing an initial public offering at the tender age of five years. That's earlier than most of its technologically minded peers, which tend to mature a little more before going public. Snap's value, however, may yet have some growing to do.    The Los Angeles-based startup led by 26-year-old Evan Spiegel and formerly known as Snapchat submitted confidential IPO paperwork earlier this month under a law designed for smaller firms. A market debut early next year could get Snap trading ahead of highly anticipated stock sales by older ventures including Airbnb, Palantir, Pinterest and Uber.    Figures discussed only privately so far are impressive. Snap has approximately 150 million daily active users, should generate over $350 million in revenue this year and hit $1 billion in 2017. If that's accurate, it would mean growth of nearly 200 percent. The mooted top-end valuation of $25 billion would then peg it at an eye-popping 25 times the expected top line.    Both Twitter and Facebook were expanding at about the same rate when they were five going on six. Twitter would have had only about 50 million comparable users, an estimate calculated by using the proportion of monthly-to-daily users it reported at the time of its IPO two years later. And yet it garnered a valuation, privately, of 25 times revenue. Growing pains have cut the micro-blogging site to less than five times next year's revenue.    Facebook's backers in 2009, meanwhile, were valuing the social network and its 185 million daily users at 13 times forward revenue. With some $37 billion in sales expected next year, the social networking titan still trades at around nine times, a heady multiple considering growth may be slowing to around 30 percent.    Snap should have ample room to expand, despite challenges ahead building out its bespoke advertising model, an effort just under way. It is strong in video, where the action is, and teenagers stick around for long stretches. Facebook's 430 million daily active users in the United States, Canada and Europe also suggest more growth opportunities for Snap in areas where ads are most lucrative. Twitter's fate is a cautionary tale and financial details remain to be seen, but Snap's IPO is developing into an investor photo op.
