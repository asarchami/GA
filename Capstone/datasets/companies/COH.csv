0,"   By Phil Wahba  Coach Inc's (COH.N) sales in North America fell sharply during the key holiday quarter as the handbag maker continued to lose customers to fast-growing rivals.The New York company, known for its Poppy handbags, on Wednesday reported a 13.6 percent decrease in comparable-store sales in North America.It was the third straight quarter of decline in a market that accounts for 70 percent of its revenue, and a much deeper drop for the holiday quarter than Coach forecast in October.Coach shares were down 6.2 percent to $49.29 in late morning trading.There were some bright spots in Coach's results: sales in China rose 25 percent, quelling fears a slowdown in luxury spending growth there would hurt Coach. And sales in North America for handbags priced above $400 were also up.Still, company executives expect Coach's problems to persist in North America in the next six months, predicting continued sales drops there.Relief may only come in the fall, when the first collection designed under its new creative director, Stuart Vevers, hits stores.Until then, Coach will have to make do with offerings many analysts said are stale and less appealing than merchandise offered by rivals such as Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS.N), kate spade FNP.N and Tory Burch, which are aggressively expanding their fleets of stores. ""These guys are definitely losing share. Fashionwise, they're missing the beat,"" Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said.Between 2011 and 2012, Coach's share of the U.S. handbag market fell to 17.5 percent from 19 percent, according to Euromonitor International. Michael Kors' market share rose to 7 percent from 4.5 percent.North American sales fell 9 percent to $983 million in the second quarter ended December 28, a startling drop in a women's handbags and accessories market Coach executives said grew by a ""high single-digit"" percentage during the period.Chief Executive Victor Luis is pinning Coach's turnaround hopes on Vevers' collections making Coach fashion-forward again. Luis told analysts on a call that Vevers was ""providing a fashion relevance for the brand like we have never had.""Vevers joined Coach from Loewe - a luxury handbag brand owned by LVMH (LVMH.PA) - in September, replacing longtime creative director Reed Krakoff. Coach's overall revenue fell 5.6 percent to $1.42 billion, in the second quarter, while net income dropped to $297.4 million, or $1.06 per share, from $352.8 million, or $1.23 per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.11 per share on revenue of $1.48 billion, according to Thomson ReutersI/B/E/S. REBALANCING ACT  To win back shoppers, the 73-year-old company is trying to offer more footwear and fashion to become a lifestyle brand. Coach will be presenting a collection at New York Fashion Week next month for the first time.Chief Executive Victor Luis, who took the reins this month from longtime CEO Lew Frankfort, told Reuters that Coach is ""rebalancing"" its merchandise selection and increasing its offerings of handbags priced $400 or more.After the 2008-09 recession, Coach had ramped up its selection of lower-price handbags.During the 2013 holiday season, Coach had to contend with a problem many retailers have complained about: a drop in traffic to shopping malls, and fewer shoppers coming into its stores. Still, kate spade and Michael Kors, which operate many stores in the same malls as Coach, are expected to report sales gains.Coach's poor sales led to a surplus of merchandise it said it would clear through its factory outlets, raising the specter of more pressure on its profit margin.

9,"  Pistons stomp Spurs in Loyer's coaching debutAUBURN HILLS, Mich. -- John Loyer gave the Detroit Pistons some energy along the sideline in his NBA head-coaching debut. The team responded with an upbeat performance after the abrupt firing of Mo Cheeks.Point guard Brandon Jennings led Detroit with 21 points and six assists, and the Pistons posted a 109-100 win over the short-handed San Antonio Spurs on Monday night at The Palace.Loyer paced the sideline, barking out instructions and encouraging his younger players after mistakes as well as well-executed plays. It was a stark contrast to Cheeks, who preferred to sit and watch. Cheeks was fired Sunday after just 50 games as the head coach, even though the team won twice over the weekend.""Being my first game, I have no style,"" said Loyer, who recorded his first head coaching win since the 1999-2000 season, when he led Wabash Valley College to a 19-12 record. ""I just do what I think is best for the team. There's going to be nights when you need to sit there and let them play. And there are emotional nights and your guys need you a little more. We've got enough veteran guys who know what to do, but I just think a few of our guys need very positive reinforcement.""Jennings was stunned and disappointed by Cheeks' firing but felt Loyer's communication skills gave the club a boost.

10,"  (Recasts throughout to add details from conference call)By Phil WahbaApril 29 Coach Inc's North American woes deepened last quarter as the upscale retailer continued to lose market share and the new line of clothes, shoes and handbags it is banking on to reverse its fortunes remained months away from hitting stores.The New York-based company on Tuesday reported a 21 percent drop in sales at North American stores open at least a year for the three months ended March 29, its fourth straight decline.In contrast to its booming China sales, Coach is expecting another big decline this quarter in North America, where it gets about 70 percent of its revenues.Coach shares fell 9 percent to $45.91 in morning trading.Known for its Poppy handbags, Coach has struggled to keep up with its fast-growing affordable luxury competitors, particularly Kate Spade & Co and Michael Kors Holdings Ltd, whose handbags are gaining popularity. Coach's poor U.S. sales in the quarter compared with what Chief Executive Officer Victor Luis estimated was the industry's ""high single-digit percentage rate"" increase in handbag sales.The U.S handbag market was $7.4 billion in 2013, according to Euromonitor International.Last year, to win back customers, the company said it would expand its assortment and become a so-called lifestyle brand, with a bigger selection of shoes and clothes than before, in addition to handbags. It hired British designer Stuart Vevers to replace longtime creative director Reed Krakoff.Vevers' first collection, set to hit stores in September, received positive reviews in the fashion press during New York Fashion Week in February, but Luis told analysts on a call that Coach had not tested the collection with customers.""Good feedback from media is not the same as customers coming in the doors - they're having trouble bringing in younger customers,"" said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough. Luis, who took the reins in January, said that up to 85 percent of items in its full-service stores would have Vevers' imprimatur by the autumn.There were some bright spots in Coach's results: Luis said sales of handbags priced at $600 or more were good. But the company continued to struggle with its bread-and-butter $400 and under bags.And a 25 percent sales increase in China helped limit some of the decline in North America. Coach also did well with men's items, where sales rose 20 percent.Overall revenue fell 7.4 percent to $1.1 billion in the third quarter ended March 29, less than the $1.13 billion analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Quarterly net income fell to $190.7 million, or 68 cents per share, from $238.9 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier.

""After that, I believe that there will be an upside to the European retail operating margins,"" Chief Executive John Idol said on a post-earnings conference call.Start-up expenses, such as leasing costs, would hurt its retail operating margins in Europe, the company said, prompting its shares to fall as much as 4 percent in morning trading.The stock reversed course after rising 8 percent before the bell on Wednesday, when the company reported quarterly results that once again beat analysts' estimates.Sales in Europe, which accounts for about 10 percent of its total revenue, more than doubled to $164.7 million in the fourth quarter ended March 29. Sales in North America, its biggest market, rose 43 percent to $739.4 million on higher demand for its watches and small leather goods such as wallets and clutch bags.The strong sales helped Michael Kors grab market share from Coach Inc, which last month reported its fourth straight quarterly decline in sales from North America.Strong demand for clutches and wristlets costing around $100 right through to snakeskin handbags with a $3,000 price tag helped Michael Kors post fourth-quarter revenue of $917.5 million, beating the average analyst estimate of $816.5 million.Michael Kors' first-quarter revenue forecast of $840 million-$850 million was also higher than the average analyst forecast of $826.1 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income rose 59 percent to $161 million, or 78 cents per share, in the fourth quarter.

Coach also said that it would start holding sales twice a year to win back customers.The company plans to close two metropolitan outlets and combine 13 standalone stores catering to men with existing women's stores.As of June 2013, Coach had 351 stores and 193 factory outlets in North America, where it gets about 70 percent of its revenue.Coach's North America same-store sales fell 21 percent in the three months ended March 29, the fourth straight quarterly decline.The company's shares were down 9 percent at $35.83 in late afternoon trading.

That helped international sales rise 7 percent in the fourth quarter ended June 28, with China sales rising 20 percent.The company expects sales in China to rise 10 percent in the year ending June 2015 as it opens more stores to expand in tier 3 and tier 4 cities.Coach's results in China contrasted with those of LVMH , the No.1 maker of luxury goods, which reported lower sales from the region due to government efforts to crack down on corruption and conspicuous spending. WEAK NORTH AMERICA Coach said it expects China sales to top $600 million in fiscal 2015, higher than the $545 million a year earlier.The growth in China will help Coach partly offset the weak North American market, where the company expects sales to fall in low double digits in percentage terms.Coach's sales in North America fell 16 percent in the fourth quarter, while same-store sales decreased for the fifth straight time. In contrast, Michael Kors' sales rose 30 percent in North America during the same period. Coach in June outlined plans to shut about 70 stores in the region, most of which will be in the first half of the year, and cut discounted online sales to arrest the slide.The company is also sprucing up its in-store presentations by having more open, accessible and prominently branded displays, CEO Victor Luis said on a conference call on Tuesday.However, the store closures and inventory adjustment hit fourth-quarter profit and is expected to impact the current year's results as well.Coach's net income fell 66 percent in the quarter. Excluding items, it earned 59 cents per share.Net sales fell 7 percent to $1.14 billion, dragged down by the weak North American business, which contributed 61 percent of sales.Analysts on an average had expected earnings of 53 cents on revenue of $1.09 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Coach's shares were up 5 percent at $35.94 on Tuesday.Up to Monday's close, the stock has fallen 36 percent in the last year compared with a 13.6 percent rise in the S&P 500 .

28,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, December 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of 'BBB' to Coach, Inc. (Coach). Fitch has also assigned a 'BBB'  rating to the entity's shelf registration of senior unsecured debt securities.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.  As Coach indicated at its June investor meeting, the company anticipated a debt  issuance in fiscal 2015 for its new headquarters. The total cost of  land/construction for the headquarters is expected to be $750 million, of which  the remaining $550 million will be incurred in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016.  Coach currently does not have any long-term debt in its capital structure.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Coach's strong positioning in the premium bags and small  leather good market with a #1 share of the domestic market and #2 globally, high  EBITDA margins, and reasonable credit metrics. However, the company's North  American business, which accounts for two-thirds of total revenue and EBITDA  before allocating corporate expenses, is experiencing significant pressure on  top-line growth and profitability due to lack of newness in product introduction  and brand messaging. There has also been an influx of participants that have  aggressively built share in the entry level luxury price points that Coach  competes in.  As a result, Fitch expects North American EBITDA to decline by more than 50% in  fiscal 2015 from a peak level of $1.6 billion in fiscal 2013. The ratings are  therefore contingent on Coach's ability to maintain strong momentum in its  international business as it grows its presence in China and enters Europe to  offset some of the North American decline. However, Japan (14% of total  revenue), which is currently its second largest market is expected to remain  under some pressure.  Fitch expects overall top line to contract by 10% over the next two years to  $4.3 billion and EBITDA to decline to $1.1 billion from $1.5 billion in fiscal  2014, with the growth in the international segment somewhat offsetting the sharp  decline in the North American business. Fitch expects the EBITDA margin to  decline to the mid-20% range from 36%-37% in fiscal 2011-2013. Fitch expects  leverage (lease-adjusted debt/EBITDAR) to increase 1.5x to the mid-2x range by  the end of fiscal 2015 (ended June 2015), assuming debt issuance of $750 million  sized to total cost of the headquarters. Fitch expects leverage to remain in the  mid-2x over the next 36 months.  Significant Contraction in Domestic Business Coach has approximately $4.8 billion in sales and directly operates over 1,000  stores, including full-price retail and outlet concepts and has over 1,200  wholesale doors globally. Coach's top line has grown at a CAGR of 8.3% over the  last five years supported by the strong recovery in the demand for luxury goods  in North America over this timeframe and Coach's expansion into new markets, in  particular China.  However, the North American segment, which generated $3.1 billion (including  approximately $1320 million of Canadian sales) or 65% of total revenue in fiscal  2014 has come under significant pressure over the past few quarters. The  weakness is attributed to the lack of product newness and underinvestment in its  store base and marketing in an increasing competitive space with companies such  as Michael Kors - now #2 after Coach - Kate Spade and Tory Burch, significantly  gaining share in the entry level luxury price points that Coach competes in. As  a result, Coach's women's handbag business (55% of total fiscal 2014 revenue) is  down 8.5% over the last two years while its accessories business (22% of  revenue) is down 10.6%. Coach expects to invest heavily in remodeling its stores over the next few years  to create a new store environment - particularly its flagship stores, close 70  underperforming North America retail stores in fiscal 2015, introduce new  product lines, and increase its marketing spend by $50 million over fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2016.  Fitch expects North American comparable store sales (comps) to decline in the  mid-20% range, with 10 points of the comp decline attributable to promotional  cutback in its Electronic Outlet Store (eOS).  Coach generated $500 million in  e-commerce sales in fiscal 2014, mostly via its outlet flash sales held three  times a week in fiscal 2014 and the company expects this business alone will  shrink by $300 million in fiscal 2015. Coach will reduce the number of eOS  events from three times per week to one time per week (started in 1Q'15) and  eventually move to one to two events per month. Overall, the North American business is expected to contract by over 20% over  the next two years to $2.5 billion from $3.1 billion in FY2014 (ended June) and  a peak level of $3.5 billion in FY2013. Fitch expects the North American EBITDA  (before allocating corporate expenses) to decline to around $750 million in  fiscal 2015 from $1.4 billion in fiscal 2014 and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2013. It  could decline to below the $700 million level in fiscal 2016 before stabilizing  or growing modestly thereafter assuming comp store sales turn positive.  International Operations a Bright Spot Coach's international operations, which generated $1.6 billion or 34% of total  revenue in fiscal 2014, has experienced compound revenue growth of 12.5% over  the past five years and Fitch expects similar growth rates for the next three to  five years. China accounted for two-thirds of the growth with sales growing from  $55 million in fiscal 2009 to $545 million in fiscal 2014.  Japan is currently Coach's largest international market with fiscal 2014 sales  of $655 million, but sales in China are likely to surpass Japan's by the end of  2015. China's sales are expected to grow up to $800 or $900 million by 2019,  assuming low double digit growth. Sales in Japan have been weak in contrast, and  Fitch expects sales to decline from a peak of $845 million in fiscal 2012 to the  $600 million level going forward as the overall market is expected to be  relatively flat. Coach recently entered the European market, generating $60  million in revenue in F2014 and is expected to increase it to $100 million in  F2015. The growth trajectory in Europe could potentially take longer than China,  in Fitch's view, as it is a more mature market.  As of Sept. 27, 2014, Coach had $661 million in cash mostly held overseas and  $247 million in short-term investments. Coach has a $700 million unsecured  domestic bank facility with a maturity date of Sept. 9, 2019. As of Sept. 27,  2014 and June 28, 2014, there was $170 million and $140 million outstanding on  the facility.  Material Increases in Capex Contribute to FCF Declines Coach generated strong free cash flow (after dividends) of $700 million to $800  million between F2011 through F2013. However, FCF dropped to approximately $280  million in fiscal 2014 given a $350 million decline in EBITDA and $120 million  of spending on Coach's new headquarters.  The total cost of land/construction for the headquarters is expected to be $750  million, of which the remaining $550 million will be incurred in fiscal 2015 and  fiscal 2016. In addition, non-headquarters capex is expected to accelerate to  $350 million in fiscal 2015 from the $220 million annual level in fiscal  2012/2013 as Coach spends heavily on its remodeling activity and international  expansion.  Of the $250-$300 million in transformation charges, Coach took $132 million in  4Q'14 and $37 million in 1Q'15, leaving $80-$130 million over the balance of  fiscal 2015. 40% or $100 million to $120 million of these charges will be cash  charges.  As a result of this and further deterioration in EBITDA to the $1.1 billion  level, Fitch expects FCF to decline around $400 million annually over F2015 and  F2016.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action would be driven by the improvement in Coach's core  North American business with comparable store sales growing in line with or  better than the mid-single digit growth Fitch expects for the domestic luxury  space and total EBITDA improving to the $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion range that  would drive leverage to the low 2x range and enable Coach to be FCF positive.  A negative rating action could result in the event of worse than expected  top-line, profitability and cash flow trends driven due to a deterioration in  its brand or market positioning in the low-to-mid tier luxury market; a slowdown  in the momentum of Coach's international business; and/or a sustained increase  in leverage above the mid-2x range.

29,"  (Adds Financial Times report on Coach, more background)By Olivia Oran and Mike StoneNEW YORK Dec 2 Footwear retailer Brown Shoe Company Inc is trying to acquire women's luxury shoe retailer Stuart Weitzman Holdings LLC, which could fetch close to $1 billion, three people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.Brown Shoe is competing against other potential suitors, that include private equity firms and financial investors, the sources said. An outcome in the auction for Stuart Weitzman is expected this month, they added.The Financial Times, citing people familiar with the matter, reported on Tuesday that luxury accessories maker Coach Inc  was also vying for Stuart Weitzman. Buyout firm Sycamore Partners, the owner of Stuart Weitzman, has been working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Citigroup Inc on the sale of the company, Reuters reported in August.The sources requested anonymity because the sale process is confidential. Representatives for Sycamore declined to comment. Representatives for Brown, Coach and Stuart Weitzman did not respond to requests for comment. Stuart Weitzman operates 45 retail stores across the United States and also has 62 elsewhere. Brown Shoe operates more than 1,200 stores, primarily in the United States.Sycamore Partners acquired Stuart Weitzman earlier this year as part of its $2.2 billion purchase of Jones Group Inc, the fashion company that owns retail chains Nine West and Jones New York. St. Louis-based Brown Shoe was a bidder in the initial Jones Group sale process, which began in the summer of 2013. Brown Shoe had previously acquired the Sam & Libby brand from Jones Group in 2012.Brown Shoe's interest in Stuart Weitzman is in line with its recent investments in higher-end brands such as Jack Erwin, a men's dress shoe line.Last week, Brown Shoe posted higher-than-expected quarterly sales and raised its fiscal-year earnings outlook. Its shares are up 15 percent year to date, outperforming a 12 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index.

39,"   By Stephanie Rogan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - There can be no clearer admission that Coach has exhausted the growth opportunities of its core brand than the $574 million purchase of luxury shoe-maker Stuart Weitzman. Yet for shareholders, who have lopped off half of the company's value since 2012, Coach's acceptance of its limitations offers a sign of hope. Coach is betting it can use its know-how to expand other, smaller brands like LVMH and Kering have.For 74 years Coach focused exclusively on its own label, a strategy that worked until a couple of years ago. Despite an ambitious brand makeover, the company has failed to reverse sliding same-store sales and struggled to maintain its cachet with fickle fashionistas.As Coach has steadily lost market share to designers like Michael Kors and Kate Spade, its market value has plunged in half, to $10 billion today. And a rapid expansion into factory outlets has also tarnished the brand's cool factor.Last year the company hired a new creative director and staged its first New York fashion week show in February. The revamp has thus far failed to bear fruit. In October, the company posted its sixth straight quarter of North American same-store sales declines. Enter Stuart Weitzman. The cobbler, a red carpet regular and maker of People Magazine's ""trendsetter"" boot of the year, offers Coach a chance to jazz up its reputation. With 118 retail locations, Stuart Weitzman has roughly the same footprint Coach had a decade ago before nearly doubling its global presence and growing net sales from $1.3 billion in 2004 to $4.8 billion in fiscal year 2014.Stuart Weitzman posted revenue of $300 million for the year ended Sept. 30 and has grown sales at a 10 percent compounded annual rate in the last five years. The ambition for Coach is to apply its experience in quadrupling its core brand over the past decade to Stuart Weitzman. That's the way luxury conglomerates LVMH and Kering have managed to maintain their sparkle. It's a new strategy for Coach, but the old one wasn't working.  CONTEXT NEWS - On Jan. 6 Coach said it will buy footwear company Stuart Weitzman from private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal valued at up to $574 million. The leather-goods maker has been in the midst of a brand revamp since replacing its longtime chief executive in January 2013. In June Coach told investors it would close 70 stores.(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist.

The company itself said its sales this year would be ""pressured"" by the cutback in promotions. But, JP Morgan analysts cited improved assortments and the remodeling of stores as signs that the company's strategy is sound.Kate Spade was bolder, forecasting a 20 percent jump in 2015 sales, excluding items.

Coach, founded in a Manhattan loft in 1941, is transforming itself by renovating its stores and spending more on reviving its brand. It is also refreshing styles to target younger customers under creative director and designer Stuart Vevers.  Vevers is bringing youthfulness to the brand, Chief Executive Victor Luis told Reuters, adding that the move is striking a chord with millennials and fashion-conscious customers. Sales fell 0.8 percent in the first quarter, compared with declines of between 11 and 16 percent in the previous three quarters. North America same-store sales fell 9.5 percent, the smallest decline in two years.This improvement comes after the company lost its appeal as a luxury brand due to years of over exposure, allowing newer rivals such as Michael Kors Holdings Ltd (KORS.N) and Kate Spade & Co (KATE.N) to capitalize on Coach's weakness. To preserve its luxury image, Coach has pulled back on flash sales and is focusing on pricier handbags such as the $600 Ace satchel and $500 Nomad hobo bag.      However, analysts said Coach's results cannot be read as a precursor to the performance of Michael Kors or Kate Spade. ""A lot of this for Coach is self-help,"" said Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, adding that the handbag market is still challenged due to lack of innovation.

North America same-store sales fell 9.5 percent, the smallest decline in two years.This improvement comes after the company lost its appeal as a luxury brand due to years of over exposure, allowing newer rivals such as Michael Kors Holdings Ltd and Kate Spade & Co to capitalize on Coach's weakness.To preserve its luxury image, Coach has pulled back on flash sales and is focusing on pricier handbags such as the $600 Ace satchel and $500 Nomad hobo bag. However, analysts said Coach's results cannot be read as a precursor to the performance of Michael Kors or Kate Spade.""A lot of this for Coach is self-help,"" said Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, adding that the handbag market is still challenged due to lack of innovation.Net income fell 19 percent to $96.4 million, or 35 cents per share.Excluding items, Coach earned 41 cents per share.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 40 cents per share and revenue of $1.04 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Coach's shares were up 4.7 percent at $31.75 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Up to Monday's close, the stock had fallen 19.3 percent this year.

58,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'BBB' long-term  Issuer Default Rating (IDR) for Coach, Inc. (Coach). The Rating Outlook is  Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings reflect Coach's strong position in the premium bag and small leather  goods market as well as reasonable credit metrics despite recent EBITDA  headwinds.  Since FY 2013 (ended June 2013), the company has seen significant  sales declines in its North American (NA) business, now representing 60% of  total sales and EBITDA.  Reported international sales growth has averaged 2%  since FY 2013, as growth in China and Coach's entry in Europe has been mitigated  by a decline in Japan and currency headwinds.   The 30% decline in consolidated EBITDA to $1.1 billion in FY 2015, coupled with  the company's issuance of $600 million of senior unsecured notes and $300  million term loan in March 2015 to support the purchase and construction of its  new headquarters, has resulted in adjusted leverage increasing to 2.6x from 1.4x  at the end of FY 2014, in line with Fitch's expectations. Leverage is expected  to remain reasonable in the 2.5x-2.7x range over the next three years, as Fitch  expects consolidated EBITDA to be $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion and adjusted debt  to be modestly higher (due to rent expense associated with international  expansion).  Risks to the ratings include the inability for domestic comps to  stabilize by mid-2016 and grow in the low single digits thereafter or a material  deceleration in its international business.  North American Sales Decline NA revenue declines have stemmed from weak new-product acceptance coupled with a  reduction in promotional events as the company aims to elevate price/quality  perception and improve full-priced selling.  Competition in the entry-level  luxury handbag/accessories sector, meanwhile, has increased.  Coach revenue fell  approximately 10% to $3.1 billion in FY 2014 and 20% to $2.5 billion in FY 2015,  on both negative comparable store sales (comps) and net store closures.  Comps  at Kate Spade and Michael Kors, on the other hand, trended in the double digits  during 2013-2014, yielding NA sales increases of $2 billion for the two  companies over that period (note: includes apparel). Coach's revenue trajectory caused NA EBITDA declines of around 19% to $1.27  billion in FY 2014 and around 27% to $930 million in FY 2015.  During this time,  EBITDA margin contracted approximately 800 basis points (bps) to around 37%  before unallocated corporate expense due to gross margin declines and fixed-cost  deleverage on flattish SG&A expense.   NA EBITDA after corporate overhead has  declined from $1.1 billion in FY 2013 (32% of sales) to $430 million in FY 2015  (18% of sales).   FY 2016 as Inflection Point Coach has undertaken a number of actions to reposition the brand further  upscale, with the intention to increase the penetration of full-price sales and  higher price point purchases.  First, Stuart Vevers, the company's creative  director who joined in June 2013, has evolved the product mix with a view toward  an innovative, design-led and editorial offering.  Second, Coach has invested in  remodels of owned stores and department store presentations, yielding positive  sales results.  The remodels will continue in FY 2016, and the company plans to  end the year with around 40% of the store base in the updated layout.  Third,  Coach has restructured its promotional cadence by reducing the amount of  periodic sale events, and should cycle through these reductions in 2016.   Finally, Coach has refocused its marketing efforts away from price point and  event messaging to a product-focused platform across e-mail, social media, and  fashion industry activity. As a result of the above, FY 2016 is expected to represent an inflection point  for Coach, as it anniversaries the significant reduction in promotional events  while reaping the benefits of its other investments.  Fitch anticipates a 4% NA  comps decline (of 22% in FY 2015), somewhat worse than management guidance of a  low single-digit decline, and flattish NA EBITDA (before corporate expense) at  the low $900 million level.  Comp store sales are expected to improve  sequentially from -9.5% in in first quarter 2015 (1Q15) to flattish by 4Q15, vs.  the company's guidance of positive 4Q comps.   On an annualized basis beginning FY 2017, Fitch expects positive low  single-digit comps and continued reduction of square footage to yield modestly  positive NA sales growth.  Fitch assumes modest EBITDA margin expansion from  trough FY 2015 levels; however, the fashion nature of Coach's assortment,  coupled with its recent volatile history, could lead either to material downside  or upside risk to our expectations.   International Sales Stability International sales, which represent approximately 40% of revenue, have been  less volatile, with a 4% increase in FY 2015 (constant currency basis).  In  FY2015, despite increasing economic headwinds and a sales decline in 4Q, China  continued its growth trajectory, becoming Coach's largest international market  at $636 million, while Europe had the highest growth rate, albeit from a small  base.  Japan, Coach's second largest market at approximately $550 million in  revenue, experienced a modest constant currency decline, due largely to a  consumption tax increase in April 2014.  Fitch expects low single-digit constant  currency growth in FY 2016 international revenue as China and Europe continue to  expand, but notes the company's reported results will be negatively impacted by  the strong U.S. dollar.  Annual sales growth beginning FY 2017 is expected to  trend in the mid-to-high single digits, predicated on mid-single-digit growth in  China and significant square footage expansion in Europe. Reasonable Credit Metrics Despite a projected 45%-50% decline in EBITDA from peak fiscal 2013 levels to  fiscal 2016, credit metrics remain reasonable with LTM adjusted debt/EBITDAR  leverage of 2.7x. Fitch expects leverage to remain in the mid-2x range over the  next 24-26 months, with EBITDA growth in FY 2016 onwards being somewhat offset  by increased capitalized rent from expansion in China and Europe.   While free cash flow (FCF; after dividends) is expected to be an outflow of  approximately $300 million in FY 2016 due to headquarters and store remodel  spending, the company should generate $300 to $400 million of FCF in each of the  subsequent years based on annual capital spending of approximately $250 million. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --For FY 2016, Fitch expects flattish company revenues, before the full-year  inclusion of the recently closed Stuart Weitzman acquisition, which should add  approximately $330 million or 7% to sales.  NA Coach brand sales are expected to  be slightly down with international sales up modestly on continued growth in  China and Europe.  NA comps are expected to be up low single digits after 2016,  with continued expansion in Europe driving low single-digit company-wide annual  revenue growth.  International sales are expected to represent around 45% of  Coach branded sales in FY 2019 vs. 40% in FY 2015. --FY 2016 EBITDA is expected be flat at $1.08 billion from continued negative NA  comp store sales, offset by approximately $35 million from Stuart Weitzman.   Fitch expects the company to show its fourth year of flattish SG&A spending  (before the impact of the Stuart Weitzman acquisition) and therefore low  probability of the company finding incremental, material cost saves in the short  term.  Based on improving sales trends, EBITDA is expected to improve to $1.3  billion over FY 2017-2019. -FCF is expected to be an outflow of $300 million after common dividends of $375  million in FY 2016, due to increased spending on the company's new headquarters  and store remodels.  FCF is expected to turn positive $300 million in fiscal  2017 and trend to the $400 million level by 2019 due to improved EBITDA and  lower capex spend. --Adjusted leverage is expected to remain in the mid-2x range.  RATING SENSITIVITIES A positive rating action would result from Coach's core NA  comparable store  sales growing in line with or better than the low- to mid-single digit growth  Fitch expects for the domestic luxury space, and total EBITDA improving to the  $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion range, driving leverage to the low 2x range. A negative rating action could result from worse than expected top-line,  profitability and cash flow trends driven by the inability to stabilize its  market share in the low- to mid-tier luxury market; a slowdown in the momentum  of Coach's international business; and/or a sustained increase in leverage above  the mid-2x range. LIQUIDITY As of the end of FY 2015, Coach had $1.3 billion in cash and $234 million in  short-term investments, of which nearly 60% is overseas. Coach has a $700  million unsecured domestic facility with a maturity date of March 18, 2020. As  of June 27, 2015, Coach had no borrowings under this facility.   Historically, Coach has generated strong FCF (after dividends) of $700 million  to $800 million between FY 2011 through FY 2013. However, FCF dropped to  approximately $300 million in FY 2014 given a $350 million decline in EBITDA and  $90 million related to Coach's new headquarters. FCF in fiscal 2015 was about  $230 million on a $470 million further EBITDA decline mitigated by lower cash  taxes and working capital reduction, and $145 total million spending on the new  headquarters.  As a result of continued EBITDA headwinds and a final year of headquarters  investment, FCF is expected to decline to negative $300 million in FY 2016 but  return to positive $300 million in FY 2017 as EBITDA stabilizes and capex  moderates.   The total cost of headquarters construction is expected to total $750 million  through FY 2017, of which $380 million of the remaining $395 million will be  incurred in 2016. In addition, capex (excluding headquarters) is expected to  accelerate to approximately $300 million in FY 2016 from an average of $200  million annually the prior four years due to store remodels, moderating to the  $250 million level annually thereafter. The company also incurred $91 million in cash charges related to its expense  management initiatives in fiscal 2015 and is expected to incur $26 million in  after-tax cash charges in FY 2016.  Note that the 2016 FCF estimate excludes an  expected $125 million inflow from the sale of the company's existing  headquarters.

68,"  Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) has appointed former Coach Inc (COH.N) executive Jane Nielsen as chief financial offer, two days after announcing a sweeping plan to lower costs and revive sales growth at the luxury fashion brand.Nielsen will replace Robert Madore, who has been the CFO since April 2015, Ralph Lauren said on Thursday.Ralph Lauren, which owns the Polo and Lauren brands, said on Tuesday it was cutting about 1,000 jobs and closing 50 stores.Nielsen, who will start at Ralph Lauren from Sept. 6, is part of a string of new executive appointments at the luxury fashion house.

77,"   By Subrat Patnaik  Luxury handbag maker Coach Inc is expected to post its first quarterly same-store sales growth in North America in more than three years as its push to turn around the business gains traction.The 75-year-old company has renovated stores in the past two years, bought shoe maker Stuart Weitzman and hired well-known fashion designers to boost sales.More importantly, the company has worked to regain its cachet - after its bags lost their premium status due to an expansion spree that made them too ubiquitous.Coach, scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, has since cut back on promotions and stocked fewer products at department stores.The strategy seems to be working.""Coach has repositioned its brand to be more premium, moving away from excessive discounting and promotions to selling more at full price,"" Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino, told Reuters.""This caused challenges initially, but with new collections, consumers are starting to look again and more of them are now buying in to Coach at full price."" The company is expected to report a 1.8 percent increase in North America comparable-store sales for the April-June period, according to research firm Consensus Metrix, versus a 19 percent decline a year earlier.Rival Michael Kors Holdings, however, is expected to report a 4.7 percent fall in same-store sales for the April-June period, its fifth decline in six quarters.Kors, scheduled to report first-quarter results on Wednesday, has been struggling with weak demand at department stores such as Nordstrom Inc and Macy's Inc, which are offering big discounts to attract more shoppers. In response, Kors has lowered the amount of inventory distributed to retailers and bought Michael Kors (HK) Ltd, its exclusive licensee in China and some other regions in Asia, to increase its direct exposure to growing Asian markets.But the turnaround is expected to take time.The company's strategy of reducing sales through third-party retailers is expected to pull down sales in the April-June quarter, marking its first drop since going public in 2011.The key difference between Coach and its rivals is the timing, Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel said. ""Coach is about to break through the turn around, Kors is essentially starting it,"" Siegel said.Kate Spade & Co, the smallest but the fastest growing among the top three listed U.S. handbag makers, disappointed with its results last week.Second-quarter same-store sales growth at the company, known for its quirky and colorful satchels and totes, came in well below analysts' estimates, sending its shares down more than 20 percent.Coach shares have risen more than 28 percent this year up to Friday's close, compared with a 3.6 percent decline in the S&P 500 Textile, Apparel and Luxury Goods (Industry) index. Kors' stock is up by more than a quarter.

Analysts on average had expected a 1.8 percent rise, according to Consensus Metrix.

The market value of the combined company would have been above $20 billion, according to the Financial Times.
