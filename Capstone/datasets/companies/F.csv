1,"  * Results by six biggest automakers miss expectations* Late Thanksgiving date, bad weather hit December sales* Industry sales in 2014 expected to rise as high as 16.5 mln vehicles* U.S. auto sales rise 7.6 pct in 2013 versus prior yearBy Bernie Woodall and Ben KlaymanDETROIT, Jan 3 The U.S. auto industry limped to its best year since the boom times before 2008 as results came up short in December as a late Thanksgiving holiday robbed sales from the year's final month.The tough sledding in December does not suggest a difficult 2014, however, as several executives and analysts expect auto industry growth to continue outpacing the overall U.S. economy as it has since the recession.In addition to the late U.S. Thanksgiving holiday weekend, December sales were hurt by snow and ice storms that kept consumers away from dealerships, automakers and analysts said.""Sales were pulled into November, but also people were more impacted by the compressed shopping season, most of which was in December,"" Kelley Blue Book senior analyst Karl Brauer said. ""People were doing more Christmas shopping than car shopping.""He added that industry-watchers should not be overly concerned by a December that was affected by the timing of a holiday in the previous month. Last month included Jan. 2 due to a quirk in the calendar that affected how automakers typically report monthly sales.Monthly auto sales are seen as an early indicator of consumer spending.U.S. industry sales in 2013 finished at 15.6 million vehicles, up 7.6 percent from 2012, while December results inched up 0.3 percent. The annualized sales rate in the final month was 15.4 million vehicles, well below the 16 million expected by economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters.The timing of Thanksgiving weekend had a greater impact on December sales than in recent years, causing automakers to miss expectations, said Mustafa Mohatarem, General Motors Co's   chief economist. The late December holiday season is generally one of the heaviest sales periods at U.S. auto dealerships. GM, Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen AG all said the weather was less of a negative factor than the timing of the Thanksgiving holiday.December sales were counted through Thursday, when much of the U.S. Midwest was buried in snow. The storm is now over the U.S. Northeast, but January sales will have time to recover from the current storm as the bulk of sales typically occurs later in the month, said Kurt McNeil, GM vice president of U.S. sales operations.GM shares ended 3.4 percent lower at $39.57 while Ford shares rose 0.5 percent to close at $15.51 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.BEST YEAR SINCE 2007 For all of 2013, industry sales were 50 percent higher than 2009 when they slumped to 10.4 million vehicles during the height of the recession. It was the best full-year performance  since 2007, when sales hit 16.1 million vehicles. While some economists and analysts expect 2014 sales to rise to between 16 million and 16.5 million vehicles, there is growing concern that competition will intensify, leading to higher incentives and lower profit for companies.Research firm TrueCar.com said vehicle transaction prices fell by an average of $200 per vehicle in December, or 0.6 percent, over last year, while incentives were up $103 per vehicle, or 4 percent.The gradually improving economy, including stronger job and housing markets, will drive future growth, as opposed to consumers' need to replace aging vehicles, which the industry has described as pent-up demand, said Bill Fay, U.S. head of the Toyota brand. He also cited auto loan interest rates, near historic lows, as a positive.Ford boasted the biggest gain in U.S. market share for the year, adding four-tenths of a point to finish at 15.9 percent. Subaru also showed the same rate of increase to 2.7 percent.Chrysler increased its share by two-tenths of a point to 11.3 percent, while GM was flat at 17.9 percent. The biggest losers were Kia and its parent Hyundai Motor Co, which lost four-tenths and three-tenths of a point, respectively, to 3.4 percent and 4.6 percent.GM's December sales fell 6 percent, to 230,157 new vehicles, below analysts' expectations of a slight sales gain. Sales of GM's Chevrolet Silverado full-size pickup truck fell 16 percent in the month as analysts said the automaker did not load incentives onto the redesigned vehicle to match what rival Ford was doing with its market-leading but older F-Series.Ford's sales rose 2 percent to 218,058 vehicles, missing expectations. Its F-Series pickup truck, which finished as the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. market for the 32nd straight year, had an 8 percent sales gain.Toyota's Camry finished as the top-selling passenger car for the 12th consecutive year.GM introduced new versions of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks last year while Ford will launch a redesign of its trucks later this year.Toyota Motor Corp's U.S. December sales fell 1.7 percent to 190,843 vehicles, versus expectations of a slight gain.Chrysler reported a 6 percent gain last month in its U.S. auto sales to 161,007 vehicles. That was the automaker's best December since 2007, but still narrowly missed analyst expectations. Ram pickup truck sales rose 17 percent.Jeep sales rose 34 percent in the month, led by the new Cherokee, which sold four times as well in December as the vehicle it replaced, the Jeep Liberty, did a year earlier.Honda Motor Co sales rose 2 percent to 135,255 vehicles, which also missed analysts' expectations.Nissan Motor Co sales rose 10.5 percent in December, allowing the Japanese automaker to finish with its best year for U.S. sales ever. Hyundai and Kia saw their combined sales also miss analysts' expectations.Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz won bragging rights as the top-selling luxury brand, edging BMW by a count of 312,534 vehicles to 309,280 vehicles.Chrysler is majority-owned by Italy's Fiat SpA. Earlier this week, the two companies announced that Fiat would buy the remainder of Chrysler that is currently owned by a United Auto Workers healthcare trust, for $4.35 billion.

2,"  * Bernanke says Fed committed to stimulus* Trading volume lower than usual due to holidays, snowstorm* Airline stocks rally as crude oil tumbles* Dow up 0.2 pct, S&P flat, Nasdaq down 0.3 pctBy Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, Jan 3 U.S. stocks ended a volatile session mostly flat on Friday as investors digested comments from Federal Reserve officials that raised questions about how quickly the central bank will end its stimulus program.Wall Street opened higher but subsequently pared gains after Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said the Fed faced ""immense"" challenges now that it had reduced bond-buying, and that it needed to be cognizant of a potential rapid rise in future inflation. Volatility was exacerbated by light trading volume, with about 4.61 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, well below average, with many market participants out in the wake of the New Year's holiday, as well as a snowstorm in the northeast.""Plosser suggested that it might not be an easy or smooth process for the Fed to unwind its balance sheet, which could have been be an indication the Fed could act sooner on ending bond buying than is currently expected,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.Following Plosser's comments, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said that the central bank was no less committed to accommodative monetary policies despite the recent announcement that it would slow its stimulus program. He also said the U.S. economic recovery ""clearly remains incomplete."" Equities briefly turned positive following the comments before returning to breakeven territory.General Motors fell 3.4 percent to $39.57, one of the S&P 500's biggest decliners, after the automaker reported lower December sales, below analysts' expectations of a slight gain. Ford Motor Co rose 0.5 percent to $15.51 after its sales.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 28.64 points, or 0.17 percent, at 16,469.99. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  was down 0.62 points, or 0.03 percent, at 1,831.36. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 11.16 points, or 0.27 percent, at 4,131.91. The S&P's slight decline marked the first time since 2005 that the benchmark index started a year with two straight negative sessions. For the week, the Dow fell less than 0.1 percent while both the S&P and Nasdaq lost 0.6 percent.""Valuations are full, but not egregiously rich right now,"" said Luschini, who oversees about $60 billion in assets. ""In order for markets to really outperform now, we need to see better growth develop and for earnings to brighten considerably.""Crude oil fell 1.3 percent, bringing its 2014 year-to-date losses to 4.3 percent, a fact that boosted airline stocks on Friday.

6,"  * U.S. primary share listing expected in 2015, sources say* Italy says merger a boost for country, but concerns remain* Unions sceptical Fiat will invest enough to keep all jobsBy Agnieszka Flak  and Deepa SeetharamanMILAN/DETROIT, Jan 5 Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne's merger of carmakers Fiat and Chrysler will probably entail a U.S. share listing that cements North America as the group's new centre of gravity and further sidelines Italy.Two sources close to Fiat said it was likely to move its primary listing to New York as early as 2015 after a merger with Chrysler, the third-largest U.S. automaker, heralding a politically delicate shift of focus that reflects the operating facts.Chrysler already made more than half the group's first-half revenue, turning what would have been a 501 million euro ($690 million) loss for Fiat alone into a 435 million euro profit, while Fiat plants in Italy tick along at just 41 percent capacity, according to 2013 estimates from IHS Automotive.A listing move would help Marchionne distance himself from troubles in Europe, where thousands of Fiat's Italian workers are on state-backed temporary lay-off schemes, highlight its gains in the United States and convince a larger pool of investors that the merged company can take the fight to rivals General Motors and Ford Motor Co.""With a U.S. listing, the whole investment story and the way in which people think about this company may change,"" said International Strategy and Investment analyst George Galliers.""Today people think of Fiat as a weak European player with a good exposure to South America and exposure to North America through Chrysler,"" he added. ""Once you have a U.S. listing, people are more likely to think of the entity in the same context as they do Ford and GM.""While the northern Italian city of Turin has been Fiat's seat for the past 115 years, ""the brain and muscles are in the United States; the centre of gravity has moved to the other side of the ocean"", Luciano Gallino, a sociologist who specialises in labour market changes, was quoted by ANSA news agency as saying.The listing and the likely establishment of a group headquarters outside Italy will alarm some in that country's government and unions who want to protect jobs, but it will delight investors who want cost cuts and closures, observers said. Fresh from negotiating a landmark buyout deal to take full control of Chrysler, Marchionne can now draw on his earlier experience combining the spun-off Fiat Industrial with CNH to create a U.S.-listed manufacturer of agricultural vehicles.CNH Industrial has a primary listing in New York, a secondary one in Milan, is registered in the Netherlands, and has its fiscal domicile in Britain. Fiat declined to comment on what will happen to Fiat-Chrysler after the merger.UNPOPULAR POLITICALLY A shift away from Italy would not be popular to a fragile coalition government desperately trying to protect jobs, but analysts said Rome's hands are tied, with few tools at hand to help revive car sales in Europe. ""They will again bark once the news of a listing move to New York is cemented, but ultimately there is little they can do,"" a Milan-based analyst said. ""We are dealing with a difficult market in Europe, especially in Italy, while growth is elsewhere. The government is well aware of that.""Fiat and Rome last year pledged to work together to relaunch Italy's recession-hit car market following the government's insistence that Fiat ""stay in Italy"", even after a merger with Chrysler.Since last week's news politicians and most union leaders have hailed the merger as a boost for Italy, careful not to antagonise the country's largest private-sector employer.They expect the deal to channel investment into Italian factories that will allow Fiat to launch new models into what analysts expect to be a steadying market from 2014.In an interview published in Il Sole 24 Ore on Sunday, Industry Minister Flavio Zanonato said Marchionne had already assured Rome about Fiat's presence in Italy.""In a phone conversation on Thursday, (Marchionne) expressed his intention to keep strong roots in Italy,"" the minister said. ""He confirmed he has in mind a strengthening in our country. Fiat already has a plan to increase the effort put into new models produced in Italian factories."" Zanonato said the merger, which would combine the technology, dealer networks and cash of the two companies, could only be positive for Italy.""How can a country not be satisfied by a deal ... which opens new perspectives in foreign markets? The development of the foreign network is a smart choice,"" he said.Zanonato said Rome was considering moves to revive Italy's car market, including incentives for alternative-fuel vehicles and fiscal measures to boost exports, but did not elaborate.But some unions and politicians asked for more binding commitments that Fiat would indeed put in the money it has promised to revamp underutilised plants.""Our worry is not that Fiat will stop producing cars in Italy, because they cannot ignore the Italian market,"" said Federico Bellono, general secretary of Fiom union's Turin branch. ""But we fear that the investments that will be made in Italy will be much lower than one could have expected.""Some are sceptical after Fiat scrapped a 2010 plan to invest up to 20 billion euros ($27 billion) to more than double output in Italy after market conditions deteriorated, worrying the same could happen as Fiat's attention drifts elsewhere.The carmaker has repeatedly reassured it does not intend to close factories, unlike mass-market competitors Ford, General Motors and Peugeot SA. It has also confirmed its intention to build Jeeps and a new line of Alfa Romeos in Italy for export to markets in Asia, Latin America and the United States. Detailed investment plans will be outlined at the end of April, it has said.But analysts said the investments that come through are likely to be in single-digit billion euros, not enough to preserve all jobs. Analysts estimate Fiat would need to triple production of cars in Italy to re-employ all of the thousands of workers still temporarily laid off.Ultimately, the merger will merely emphasise the diminishing stature of the Italian car industry, which in recent years has shrunk to levels last seen in the 1970s, they said.""Italy is already a province in the Fiat empire,"" Fiom's Bellono said.",2014-01-05,F,"Sun Jan 5, 2014 | 12:08pm EST",Likely US listing to further sideline Italy in Fiat-Chrysler group,http://www.reuters.com//article/fiat-chrysler-idUSL6N0KE0FH20140105?type=companyNews

15,"  SHANGHAI China has urged carmaker Chrysler Group LLC, majority-owned by Italy's Fiat SpA FIA.MI, to correct possible defects in its Jeep Wrangler, after vehicles imported into the country were found to have an elevated fire risk, China's quality watchdog said on Monday.China had banned Jeep Wrangler imports in early 2011 due to serious fire risks associated with defective gearboxes, but lifted the restrictions after Chrysler replaced vehicle parts to address the issue, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said in a statement on its website.Recent inspections by the agency, however, found the car still had relatively high fire risks, the statement said. Chrysler should ""take immediate precautionary measures so as to be responsible to consumers"", the watchdog said. It also advised Wrangler owners to thoroughly check their vehicles and avoid driving in extreme conditions.Chrysler is actively cooperating with the quality watchdog and is also in active discussion on technical issues, a China-based company representative said in response to the agency's statement. Beijing is taking a harsher stance towards products, both local and imported, that are deemed substandard amid a spate of scandals involving everything from tainted milk powder to fake donkey meat. Global automakers including Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) recalled a combined 5.3 million vehicles in China in 2013, a 66 percent increase from a year earlier, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.(Reporting by Samuel Shen and Adam Jourdan; Editing by Miral Fahmy)",2014-01-06,F,"Mon Jan 6, 2014 | 5:25am EST",China urges Chrysler to address Jeep Wrangler fire risk,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-china-chrysler-idUSBREA050BU20140106?type=companyNews

26,"   By Deepa Seetharaman and Ben Klayman | DETROIT  DETROIT General Motors Co (GM.N) named a new chief executive, Ford Motor Co (F.N) kept its old leader and Chrysler Group LLC's CEO averted a divisive public offering. And that was just in the last 30 days.This year is shaping up as a test of leadership at GM, Ford and Chrysler, five years after the U.S. auto industry's searing restructuring. While the risks ahead are no longer life-threatening, how the companies respond will set their direction for years to come and signal whether the lessons of the financial crisis were embedded deeply enough.""It's a turn of an era,"" Xavier Mosquet, senior partner and managing director at Boston Consulting Group, said in an interview. ""Frankly, it is a totally different, new type of competitive situation that is emerging.""Analysts see 2014 as a transition year, with slowing growth in the U.S. auto market and companies facing a renewed mandate to gain ground overseas. The 2015 contract talks with the United Auto Workers union also loom in the background.In the weeks leading up to this year's Detroit auto show, GM, Ford and Chrysler have all taken steps that highlight the leaders who will help them face what Mosquet described as the most competitive North American market in decades.GM vaulted its product development chief, Mary Barra, to the top spot last month. Ford CEO Alan Mulally ended months of speculation by saying last week that he would not leave to run Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) . And on New Year's Day, Sergio Marchionne struck a long-sought deal allowing him to merge Chrysler and Italy's Fiat, the two automakers he has led since 2009.These moves signal that GM, Ford and Chrysler will maintain the strategies that have allowed them to emerge from the crisis with stronger balance sheets and more attractive vehicles.But their leaders will need to be more flexible. Analysts note that the skills needed in a turnaround differ from those needed during growth years, when a wrong bet can undercut a company's future. ""In fixing a company, the issues you have to deal with are very apparent because they are the issues that make or break a business,"" independent auto consultant Maryann Keller said.""When you're running a company, you've got options,"" she added. ""You're not fixing anything, it's not financially broken anymore, but dealing with a very competitive market place is actually in some respects harder.""ROLL CALL Each U.S. automaker enters the year at a different stage of its transformation, with Ford in first place, followed by GM and then Chrysler, according to many analysts and industry observers. The positions reflect the speed at which each company has been able to restructure. Mulally was hired in 2006 to lead Ford's turnaround by knitting together its global business units to achieve economies of scale. His push helped the No. 2 U.S. automaker avoid the federal bailouts required by GM and Chrysler in 2009.This year will be the busiest year of vehicle launches in Ford's 111-year history and marks the toughest test yet of Mulally's ""One Ford"" strategy. It will also test the abilities of his presumed successor, Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields, who has spent the last year focused on improving quality.But the cost of Ford's new launches - including the highly anticipated F-150 pickup truck that is expected to be unveiled at the Detroit auto show on Monday - will dent Ford's profit this year. Ford must also grow its operations outside North America and convince investors of Fields' capabilities.""In the case of Ford, the strategy has been defined and we're very clearly in the execution phases of the strategy that oftentimes is harder than crafting the strategy itself,"" Guggenheim Securities analyst Matthew Stover said. ""In the case of GM, I think they're still crafting their strategy."" Under outgoing GM CEO Dan Akerson, Barra led an effort to simplify and unify the No. 1 U.S. automaker's engineering and design processes around the world to free up cash that GM can spend on in-car technology and other new features.The selection of Barra reflects Akerson's desire to shake up a culture he said was bedeviled by ""decades of poor decisions and indecisions and no decisions.Barra will have to make this change, while continuing her work to shrink the number of vehicle platforms at GM, reverse losses in Europe and cement the company's position in China, the world's largest auto market. Other challenges include expanding into other critical emerging markets elsewhere in Asia.Meanwhile, Marchionne's slow-motion merger of Italy's Fiat FIA.MI and Chrysler is yet another attempt at building global scale. His agreement with Chrysler's minority shareholder allows Fiat to gain full control of the No. 3 U.S. automaker and avoid an initial public offering he publicly denounced.Now he will focus on revamping Fiat's Alfa Romeo brand, a marque the Italian automaker has attempted to revive several times with little success.However, what all three U.S. automakers have in common are the labor talks each will face in 2015 with the United Auto Workers union, which represents many of the companies' hourly U.S. workers.Union leaders have already signaled a desire to claw back some of the cost-cutting changes to wages and benefits they surrendered over the last decade. High on their list is the potential elimination of the two-tier wage scale that has allowed the U.S. automakers to bring costs in line with rivals like Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. <7203.(Reporting by Deepa Seetharaman; Editing by Dan Grebler)",2014-01-12,F,"Sun Jan 12, 2014 | 12:13pm EST",Analysis: Detroit automakers face test of leadership in 2014,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-autoshow-outlook-idUSBREA0B0G920140112?type=companyNews
27,"   By Bernie Woodall and Laurence Frost | DETROIT  DETROIT Automakers are upbeat about global auto sales this year despite fears of a slowdown in the United States, which generates big profits and where sales have surged 50 percent since the recession.Europe is expected to begin bouncing back from its 20-year lows and China, the world's largest auto market, will likely continue to post double-digit gains, helped by an array of stimulus measures and robust demand in smaller inland cities. But slowing demand in the second-largest auto market, the United States, has some analysts worried incentives could rise and bit into profit margins.""You could see some pressure on the quality of profits,"" Hans-Werner Kaas, senior partner at McKinsey's automotive practice, said of the U.S. market. He is worried automakers will lose the pricing discipline they have shown since the low-point of the recession in 2009, when General Motors Co (GM.N) and Chrysler Group FIA.MI filed for bankruptcy protection.Worldwide, auto sales in 2014 are seen rising 3.4 percent, according to research firm IHS, while LMC Automotive sees an increase of 5 percent. Talk of sales and the challenges ahead will be a topic of conversation among executives at the Detroit auto show this week.In the U.S. market, analysts expect sales to land somewhere between 16 million and 16.5 million, near pre-recessionary levels, which would mean an increase of as much as 5.8 percent. In the decade before the recession began in 2008, the U.S. market averaged 16.7 million new-vehicle sales annually.While sales could rise as much as 5.8 percent in the United States this year, that would be down from 7.6 percent growth last year and about half the double-digit gains in the three prior years as the market rebounded from 2009's lows.""We're out of the restructuring phase and out of the riding the normal recovery growth and I think sometime at the end of 2014, or somewhere in 2015 — the growth from the 10 plus million cars in the U.S. to somewhere between 16 and 17 will be gone,"" said Xavier Mosquet, senior partner and managing director at Boston Consulting Group. As growth slows, there will be more pressure on all players in the U.S. market to lower prices and raise incentives to keep up sales, which could hit company profits.Kaas said that if the growth plans of all manufacturers in the U.S. market came to pass, sales would top the forecasts of 16 million to 16.5 million, so some automakers will miss their targets. In an effort to make those marks, they will be under increased pressure to lure buyers with overly generous incentives.Japanese automakers, who did not put much ""cash on the hood"" like their U.S. rivals before the recession, may hike incentives in order to compete, Kaas said. Thanks to the weaker yen, the Japanese companies have room to do that without suffering too much, but that could force others to respond.ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM  Last month's profit warning by No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co (F.N) was due to those pricing pressures, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said. Ford warned that its pre-tax profit for 2014 would be between $7 billion and $8 billion, lower than the projected $8.5 billion expected in 2013.""We think Ford's 2014 profit warning is a watershed event for the industry in terms of increased competitive pressure,"" Jonas said in a research note. ""Ford is placing a very high portion of the blame on obscure foreign currencies, engineering costs and launch timing, but we don' buy it. The elephant in the room is pricing.""For 2013, Europe's beleaguered auto market is set to post a decline close to its 2.8 percent contraction in the January-November period, rounding off a six-year slump that has led to plant closures by PSA Peugeot Citroen (PEUP.PA), Ford of Europe and GM's Opel. Most industry executives and analysts expect a return in Europe to low single-digit growth in 2014, while cautioning that further losses are likely as pricing remains under pressure due to the region's glut of excess plant capacity.""The European market remains dismal,"" Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said in a recent note. ""Perhaps the next move is up, but we remain unenthusiastic. Most (manufacturers) will remain loss-making in the region.""Southern European markets such as Spain also have potential to bounce back more vigorously from their record lows, lifting mass-market brands like Volkswagen(VOWG_p.DE)-owned SEAT and Renault's (RENA.PA) no-frills Dacia - as well as relative newcomers like Hyundai (005380.KS).In China, sales, including commercial vehicles, are forecast by LMC to grow 11 percent, the same increase seen by Automotive Foresight, based in Shanghai. IHS forecast a 9 percent increase.That is welcome news as gains in emerging markets overall, like the United States, could slow in 2014, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said.""While we continue to see the emerging markets as driving global growth in the years ahead, they don't have the same luster as in years past,"" he said in a research note.(Additional reporting by Samuel Shen and Norihiko Shirouzu in Beijing and Deepa Seetharaman in Detroit; Editing by Dan Grebler)",2014-01-12,F,"Sun Jan 12, 2014 | 12:08pm EST","Global auto sales forecast rosy, with reservations, for 2014",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-autoshow-globalsales-idUSBREA0B0GH20140112?type=companyNews

For 2013, Europe's beleaguered auto market is set to post a decline close to its 2.8 percent contraction in the January-November period, rounding off a six-year slump that has led to plant closures by PSA Peugeot Citroen, Ford of Europe and GM's Opel.Most industry executives and analysts expect a return in Europe to low single-digit growth in 2014, while cautioning that further losses are likely as pricing remains under pressure due to the region's glut of excess plant capacity.""The European market remains dismal,"" Bernstein analyst Max Warburton said in a recent note. ""Perhaps the next move is up, but we remain unenthusiastic. Most (manufacturers) will remain loss-making in the region.""Southern European markets such as Spain also have potential to bounce back more vigorously from their record lows, lifting mass-market brands like Volkswagen -owned SEAT and Renault's no-frills Dacia - as well as relative newcomers like Hyundai.In China, sales, including commercial vehicles, are forecast by LMC to grow 11 percent, the same increase seen by Automotive Foresight, based in Shanghai. IHS forecast a 9 percent increase.That is welcome news as gains in emerging markets overall, like the United States, could slow in 2014, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said.""While we continue to see the emerging markets as driving global growth in the years ahead, they don't have the same luster as in years past,"" he said in a research note.",2014-01-12,F,"Sun Jan 12, 2014 | 12:00pm EST","Global auto sales forecast rosy, with reservations, for 2014",http://www.reuters.com//article/autoshow-globalsales-idUSL2N0KK1EU20140112?type=companyNews
29,"   By Samuel Shen and Norihiko Shirouzu | SHANGHAI/DETROIT  SHANGHAI/DETROIT The world's biggest auto market will likely sustain the momentum it regained in 2013, helped by an anticipated array of economic stimulus measures and robust demand for cars in smaller cities of China's interior regions, according to industry executives and analysts.The new year should mark a second year of double-digit growth for China after sales expansion rates slumped in 2011 and 2012 to 2.45 percent and 4.33 percent, respectively. In the previous 10 years, auto demand in China often surged 30 to 40 percent annually.Those hyper growth days are over, but last year the Chinese market rebounded convincingly. In 2013, sales in China rose 13.9 percent to 21.98 million vehicles, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM).""We believe clearly for anybody working in the automobile industry, if there's one place to be, it's China,"" Hubertus Troska, head of Daimler AG's Greater China operations that include Mercedes-Benz, told reporters in Beijing on Thursday, describing growth in 2013 as being quite strong.""If things continue well, there's a good chance that the automobile market in China will grow again double-digit this year,"" said Troska, who is also a member of Daimler's management board.The revived strength of China's auto market, which will be a popular topic of conversation at this week's Detroit auto show, is a relief to global automakers whose business is still impaired by sluggish demand in Europe and an anticipated slowdown in growth in the United States this year.Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), for example, had forecast vehicle demand in China to grow at annual rates of between 5 and 7 percent over the next five years. Jochem Heizmann, head of Volkswagen's China operations, said he believes the German automaker might have been too conservative.As demand appears poised to expand much faster, ""we could sell more (cars) if we have more capacity,"" Heizmann told reporters in Guangzhou in late November.LMC Automotive forecasts an increase of 11 percent this year in China's overall automobile market for passenger cars and commercial vehicles - a forecast echoed by Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight. IHS Automotive, another consulting firm, predicts demand to grow 9 percent.CAAM said China's overall demand for automobiles will likely grow 8 to 10 percent this year. WHAT'S DRIVING DEMAND The main support for auto sales, experts say, will likely come from continued strong economic growth in China's interior provinces, as opposed to the previous decade and a half when the bulk of growth was generated in the country's coastal provinces.Another supportive factor is a series of fresh stimulus measures seen likely to be implemented this year by China's new leadership under President Xi Jinping.Those factors, combined with steady personal income growth backed up by falling vehicle prices, will help ensure a second straight year of double-digit growth, according to Yale Zhang, head of Automotive Foresight.""The market is going to grow most definitely more than 10 percent again this year,"" he said. The Chinese market should be able to comfortably overcome demand-sapping pressures such as auto sales restrictions now being implemented in a growing number of big cities, Zhang and others said. Those sales caps in cities including Shanghai and Beijing are aimed at cutting air pollution and congestion.Among global automakers, Volkswagen, General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N) are likely to benefit most from a second year of relatively strong growth. Volkswagen, GM and Ford market some of China's best-selling cars, such as the Volkswagen Lavida, the Buick Excelle, and the Ford Focus.THE JAPAN FACTOR The future for Japanese automakers in China, by contrast, remains clouded. Japanese brands led by Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T), Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Honda Motor Co Ltd (7267.T) are seen unlikely to benefit fully from China's renewed strength because of lingering political tensions between Beijing and Tokyo that have fanned anti-Japan sentiment and depressed their sales in China.Sales on a month-by-month basis recovered to pre-crisis levels for many Japanese brands toward the end of last year. Toyota for instance forecast 20 percent growth in China sales to about 1.1 million vehicles this year, compared with year-on-year growth of 9 percent in 2013.Still, some industry executives and analysts doubt a convincing reversal of fortunes for Japanese automakers. The main source of worry comes from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit last month to the Yasukuni war shrine that is seen by critics as a symbol of Japan's wartime aggression, which infuriated China and South Korea and prompted concern from the United States about deteriorating ties between the North Asian neighbors.""The political tension will likely continue,"" said He Caiman, deputy secretary general of the Guangzhou Association of Automobile Manufacturers, citing Abe's Yasukuni visit. ""For Japanese automakers, this is the biggest risk to their growth, and something out of anyone's control.""Already, the collective Japanese share of China's passenger car market fell to 16.6 percent in 2013 from 23 percent in 2011, according to LMC Automotive, following the flare-up of anti-Japanese sentiment triggered by the territorial dispute in late 2012. That year, Japan's share fell to 19.2 percent.To reverse the trend, Japanese brands are gearing up for a big new product blitz this year after spending much of the past year and half on the sidelines.Nissan, for instance, plans to launch production of upscale Infiniti brand cars in China and launch the redesigned X-Trail SUV this year while also adding new models under the Venucia brand it jointly runs with Dongfeng Motor Group Co Ltd (0489.HK).

Target buyers include those who want something smaller and people who currently drive crossover vehicles but want the utility of a truck.Any sales Canyon pulls from the low end of the full-size Silverado should be minimal, GM believes.The Canyon, scheduled to be unveiled on Sunday night ahead of the Detroit auto show this week, is meant to pull sales from Ford Motor Co's (F.N) F-150 and Chrysler Group's FIA.MI Ram 1500 pickups, but it may also take sales from Silverado as well, said Tony DiSalle, U.S. vice president of marketing for GMC.""If there is somebody that's in a full-size today that really needs a smaller, more convenient package to better fit their lifestyle, I'd rather they stay with us than go elsewhere,"" DiSalle told reporters.""That's an important part of retention.

GM showed Canyon's Chevy sibling, the 2015 Colorado, at the Los Angeles Auto Show last November.The automaker stopped making the previous Colorado and Canyon models in 2012 because of declining popularity.

The leader in the mid-sized truck segment is Toyota Motor Corp's (7203.T) Tacoma. Sales of the Canyon are expected to more than double from 2012 to more than 21,800 trucks in 2016, while Silverado sales are expected to increase 22 percent in the same period, according to LMC.GM has not disclosed the pricing for the new Canyon, but the most expensive 2012 model sold for more than $32,000, while the least expensive 2014 Silverado starts below $27,000.LMC senior vice president of forecasting Jeff Schuster sees the smaller pickups as a hedge by GM.

34,"  DETROIT Jan 13 Volvo Car Corp Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said on Monday the Swedish automaker returned to profitability in the year just ended after fixing its business in China and making cost cuts.""Our target was to break even... but I can declare already today that... we are back in the black, which is extremely positive,"" Samuelsson told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show.Samuelsson was referring to operating profit, Volvo officials said.Volvo is expected to announce its financial results for the year in March. For the first half of 2013, the company posted an operating loss of 577 million SEK ($88.71 million), according to a company spokesman.Samuelsson attributed the turnaround to Volvo's successful restructuring of its distribution network in China, which led to a 46 percent boost last year in volume in that country to 61,146 vehicles, as well as to an overhauling of its cost structure globally. Because of its aggressive cost cuts, Volvo was able to make money even though it posted only modest gains in global sales volume in 2013, Samuelsson said. Volvo sold a total of 427,840 vehicles last year, up 1.4 percent from 2012.""This year our focus will be growth,"" he said. ""If last year was sort of a year of consolidation, this year will be a year of growth.""A key component of that growth strategy, Samuelsson said, is the United States market, where the Swedish brand has struggled. Last year, according to research firm Autodata, Volvo's U.S. sales fell 10.1 percent to 61,233 vehicles. Volvo's message is that ""we're committed to the U.S. market,"" Samuelsson said. ""This year will be a year when we outperform the market.""Samuelsson said the company, which was purchased by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, hopes to regain growth momentum with some key new products. Those new models include the significantly redesigned XC-90 crossover vehicle, which he said should be unveiled later this year and start hitting show-rooms in the United States and elsewhere around the start of 2015.""We will invest more in marketing and communications. We have new products. We will be more competitive with these vehicles,"" the executive said. ""The U.S. is one focus point for us this year.""Samuelsson also said Volvo could begin to bring some vehicles manufactured at its new plant in the Chinese city of Chengdu into the United States in an effort to insulate the company from dollar-Euro currency swings.""The dollar and the RMB (yuan) have a more stable relationship than the Euro and the dollar. So in a way also China will have a big advantage (as a production hub) for the U.S. That is the possibility and also of course using more Chinese materials in the car,"" Samuelsson said.",2014-01-13,F,"Mon Jan 13, 2014 | 6:14pm EST",Volvo chief says company returned to profitability in 2013,http://www.reuters.com//article/autoshow-volvo-profitability-idUSL2N0KN2BM20140113?type=companyNews
35,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) could incorporate more aluminum into its sport utility vehicles and other models in the future, executives said on Monday, following the debut of the lightweight version of Ford's popular F-150 pickup truck.The body of the revamped F-150 is 95 percent military-grade aluminum alloy - the same kind used in Humvees - and weighs up to 700 pounds less than current truck. Using aluminum rather than steel is a key part of Ford's strategy to cut between 250 and 750 pounds from each model in its lineup.""Obviously this is our first shot (at using aluminum in) a big-volume vehicle and there's absolutely no reason why we couldn't think about taking it elsewhere,"" Executive Chairman Bill Ford told reporters at the Detroit auto show.""It is a lightweight, high-strength material and 700 pounds out of a vehicle like this - that's a big deal,"" he added.Ford's gamble that aluminum will give the company a greater edge over rivals stands in contrast to the approach of General Motors Co (GM.N), which launched its latest trucks last year, and which this week unveiled its Canyon midsize truck.""If anybody says the certainty of the next 10 years is that formula, I would say, 'Show me data-wise,'"" Mark Reuss, GM's incoming product development chief, said of Ford's bet on the lightweight metal. Ford formally kicked off its F-150 project in 2010 around the same time the company began development on its new Fusion midsize sedan and revamping its strategy in Asia.Consumer tastes and more stringent U.S. fuel economy regulations in the future - known as corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards - spurred the No. 2 U.S. automaker to rethink the F-150, the top-selling vehicle in the United States.""We made a strategic decision to change the game as the leader,"" said Joe Hinrichs, Ford's head of North and South American operations. ""We felt that with our volume and our scale we could work with aluminum providers to launch the F-150.""The redesign makes the new F-150 ""CAFE-positive"" for the first time, meaning the truck will help Ford meet those standards instead of lowering the average gasoline mileage of its lineup, Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields said. At Monday's news conference, Ford also emphasized that the lightweight metal would be tougher than steel and more resistant to dents than today's model. Hinrichs said models may be made with the alloy where it makes the most sense.""You have to look at where you get the most attribute benefits for that weight and where do customers pay for that technology. And where fuel economy can make a big difference in the market place.""As part of its testing, the truck towed a heavy trailer across the United States in both desert and high-altitude terrains and in temperatures ranging from 20 degrees below Fahrenheit to 120 degrees above. The new truck reflects how Ford, under Chief Executive Alan Mulally who came on board in 2006, has been willing to take bolder, educated risks, Deloitte consultant Joe Vitale said.The F-150's design has allowed Ford to ""bridge the gap"" between heavy truck users and casual buyers. ""You can see it in the parking lot of a Neiman Marcus,"" he said.Production of the new F-150 would begin in the fourth quarter in Dearborn, Michigan, and in early 2015 in Kansas City, Missouri. The truck will be in U.S. showrooms by the end of 2014.Bill Ford, the company's executive chairman, and Mulally both said they were pleased that the speculation that Mulally would leave to run Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) was now behind them. Mulally declined to answer any questions about why he is no longer in the running for the job.""It was time to get that distraction off the table,"" Bill Ford said in a later interview with Reuters Insider, adding that Ford has a great team ""that brought us back from the dark days of '07 and '08.""(Additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; editing by Sofina Mirza-Reid and Matthew Lewis)",2014-01-13,F,"Mon Jan 13, 2014 | 2:54pm EST",Revamped F-150 may spur more aluminum use across Ford lineup,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-autoshow-ford-aluminum-idUSBREA0C1D920140113?type=companyNews

37,"  By Deepa Seetharaman     DETROIT, Jan 13 Ford Motor Co could incorporate more aluminum into its sport utility vehicles and other models in the future, executives said on Monday, following the debut of the lightweight version of Ford's popular F-150 pickup truck.      The body of the revamped F-150 is 95 percent military-grade aluminum alloy - the same kind used in Humvees - and weighs up to 700 pounds less than current truck. Using aluminum rather than steel is a key part of Ford's strategy to cut between 250 and 750 pounds from each model in its lineup.      ""Obviously this is our first shot (at using aluminum in) a big-volume vehicle and there's absolutely no reason why we couldn't think about taking it elsewhere,"" Executive Chairman Bill Ford told reporters at the Detroit auto show.      ""It is a lightweight, high-strength material and 700 pounds out of a vehicle like this - that's a big deal,"" he added.     Ford's gamble that aluminum will give the company a greater edge over rivals stands in contrast to the approach of General Motors Co, which launched its latest trucks last year, and which this week unveiled its Canyon midsize truck.    Ford no longer serves the U.S. midsize truck market.     ""If anybody says the certainty of the next 10 years is that formula, I would say, 'Show me data-wise,'"" Mark Reuss, GM's incoming product development chief, said of Ford's bet on the lightweight metal.      Ford formally kicked off its F-150 project in 2010 around the same time the company began development on its new Fusion midsize sedan and revamping its strategy in Asia.     Consumer tastes and more stringent U.S. fuel economy regulations in the future - known as corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards - spurred the No. 2 U.S. automaker to rethink the F-150, the top-selling vehicle in the United States.     ""We made a strategic decision to change the game as the leader,"" said Joe Hinrichs, Ford's head of North and South American operations. ""We felt that with our volume and our scale we could work with aluminum providers to launch the F-150.""     The redesign makes the new F-150 ""CAFE-positive"" for the first time, meaning the truck will help Ford meet those standards instead of lowering the average gasoline mileage of its lineup, Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields said.       At Monday's news conference, Ford also emphasized that the lightweight metal would be tougher than steel and more resistant to dents than today's model. Hinrichs said models may be made with the alloy where it makes the most sense.     ""You have to look at where you get the most attribute benefits for that weight and where do customers pay for that technology. And where fuel economy can make a big difference in the market place.""       As part of its testing, the truck towed a heavy trailer across the United States in both desert and high-altitude terrains and in temperatures ranging from 20 degrees below Fahrenheit to 120 degrees above.     The new truck reflects how Ford, under Chief Executive Alan Mulally who came on board in 2006, has been willing to take bolder, educated risks, Deloitte consultant Joe Vitale said.

Production of the new F-150 would begin in the fourth quarter in Dearborn, Michigan, and in early 2015 in Kansas City, Missouri. The truck will be in U.S. showrooms by the end of 2014.     Bill Ford, the company's executive chairman, and Mulally both said they were pleased that the speculation that Mulally would leave to run Microsoft Corp was now behind them.

44,"  By Bernie Woodall and Susan TaylorDETROIT/TORONTO Jan 14 The chief executive officer of Chrysler Group LLC, which is planning to invest more than $1 billion to modernize a Canadian minivan plant, said on Tuesday it could scrap the upgrade and move production and jobs elsewhere if government and labor officials fail to come through with financial incentives.To keep production at the assembly plant, across the river from Detroit in Windsor, Ontario, Chrysler must get a deal to cut costs, Sergio Marchionne told reporters at the Detroit auto show.Time is running short to find a solution, he also said, with the automaker ""weeks away from making a final call.""Chrysler executives were to meet on Wednesday with Canadian federal officials from Ottawa, Marchionne said, following his discussion on Monday with a group from Ontario's government.""It went well. They understand the issues,"" he said of the Monday meeting. ""It's costs and a variety of things. We have to create the conditions for this to be a successful investment. It's that simple.""Marchionne, chief executive of both Chrysler and its parent, Fiat SpA, said the company could invest elsewhere if Canadian labor costs are not lowered to be more competitive with the United States.Jerry Dias, the national president of the Unifor union, which represents workers at the Chrysler Windsor plant, argues that Canadian labor costs are lower than those in the United States, after Canada's universal health care and weaker currency are factored into the equation. ""Our collective agreement is lower priced than the UAW agreement,"" he said. ""By every economic yardstick ... our costs are lower.""The UAW is the United Auto Workers, the U.S. union that represents Chrysler, General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co  workers.Unifor, formed in last year's merger of the Canadian Auto Workers and Communications, Energy and Paperworkers unions, says that its workers at the Detroit Three earn an average of $34 an hour, compared with $28 for UAW employees.Marchionne, who attended college in Windsor and spent part of his youth in Toronto, said he remembers when the exchange rate was 67 Canadian cents to the U.S. dollar. ""Ninety-two (Canadian cents) may be right today (but) the minivan is coming into the market in 24 to 30 months,"" he told reporters on Monday. Chrysler needs assurances that the economics of the deal work regardless of currency fluctuations.Marchionne has suggested that Canadian workers act more like the UAW in keeping manufacturer labor costs down.Wages aside, Dias said there is no question the next minivan will be built in Windsor, which has excelled in lean manufacturing and productivity measures.""(Marchionne) knows that he's got a good thing going on here in Windsor,"" Dias said. The two men have not talked about the investment, he added. Tony Faria, an auto industry expert and professor at the University of Windsor in Ontario, said that Marchionne is attempting to turn up the heat on Canadian governments to match generous administrations elsewhere.""He thinks Canada should step up, because it's become sort of a standard in the U.S. that states will come up with half the investment cost for a major new investment by the automakers and unquestionably ... Mexico has been incredibly aggressive,"" Faria said.Canada and Ontario pledged nearly C$143 million ($130.8 million) to Ford Motor Co last September, as Ford said it would spend C$700 million to retool an existing Oakville, Ontario plant for next-generation production.""I think our record on the auto industry has been one that would show we've placed it as a priority,"" Canada's junior finance minister Kevin Sorenson told Reuters.Chrysler's leverage, in its push for government funds, is somewhat limited, Faria said, because the automaker currently has no other North American plant where it can produce the minivans assembled in Windsor.""It's not as if Chrysler has an immediate option,"" he said. ""Chrysler has no other place to build their minivans, period.""The first new minivan to be put to market will be a Chrysler, Marchionne said to reporters on Monday.The Windsor plant produces Dodge Caravan and the Chrysler Town & Country minivans.",2014-01-14,F,"Tue Jan 14, 2014 | 4:08pm EST",UPDATE 1-Chrysler CEO pressures Canadians on minivan investment,http://www.reuters.com//article/autoshow-fiatchrysler-canada-idUSL2N0KO1F720140114?type=companyNews

He also reiterated that he planned to stay at Ford through the end of this year.Mulally spoke a day after Ford unveiled a revamped version of its top-selling F-150 truck made almost entirely out of aluminum, which the company hopes will widen its lead over rivals General Motors  Co and Chrysler Group LLC  in the lucrative truck segment. Ford originally announced Mulally's plans to remain at the automaker in late 2012, as part of a series of changes, including the promotion of Mark Fields, Mulally's eventual successor, to chief operating officer.As COO, Fields now runs the weekly ""business plan review,"" part of the structural changes implemented by Mulally. People close to Ford said last year that its newly promoted executives have been making a mark on the company while Mulally contemplated the Microsoft role as well as setting the long-term vision of the company.Those longer-term issues include Ford's growth overseas as well as how to serve the growing number of urban-dwelling consumers for whom buying a vehicle is impractical.

56,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) is betting that the tight bond between two of its senior executives can help the automaker prevent quality missteps from derailing its busiest-ever year for launching new vehicles.Joe Hinrichs, head of North and South American operations, and Raj Nair, Ford's global product development chief, are two of the key players in what has been an all-out push to stamp out problems that have dogged the automaker in the last few years.At stake are Ford's credibility and profitability as it embarks on an ambitious plan to introduce 23 new vehicles - the most in one year in company history - around the world this year.These include a radical revamp of its most profitable vehicle, the top-selling F-150 pickup truck, which was unveiled at the Detroit auto show last week. The new version uses less steel and more aluminum.""We have a lot more new product and a lot more new launches than we used to have,"" Hinrichs said in interview on the sidelines of the auto show. ""We know how important these launches are.""In the last few years, Ford has tumbled in key reliability surveys due to problems with its touch-screen dashboard system and some of its transmissions. It conducted seven recalls of its Escape crossover since its mid-2012 launch, which may have led to warranty costs of as much as $300 million in 2013.As part of the redoubling of Ford's effort to prevent quality woes, Hinrichs and Nair are drawing on their experience working together in North America and Asia for the last dozen years.Both helped shape Ford's restructuring in North America in 2005 and 2006, when Chief Executive Alan Mulally came on board to steer the automaker's turnaround. In late 2009, they went to Shanghai and spent the better part of a year away from their families to replicate Mulally's ""One Ford"" plan - which unified formerly disconnected business units to gain economies of scale - - in Asia and improve quality.The two now conduct high-level reviews every month or so of all major programs to pinpoint potential problems, a practice that will continue throughout 2014.Over the years, the two have developed an almost intuitive understanding of the other's perspective, Hinrichs and Nair said in a joint interview late last year.Their strong rapport allows them to divvy up duties and work more effectively, they said. So when a scheduling conflict arises, they are comfortable if one of them has to miss a launch review as long as the other person is in the room.""When we look at something, 99 times out of a 100, we're both seeing the same thing,"" Nair said. ""A lot of times, we both don't have to be there because of that.""Then Hinrichs jumped in: ""Which is important because there's only so much time in the day."" NOT POINTING FINGERS The Escape recalls have also been a black eye for Ford and account for most of the $250 million to $300 million in warranty expenses that Ford expects to pay for 2013.These costs could pinch its 2013 operating margin in North America, Ford said last month.Ford's woes largely stem from the fact that it is launching more new vehicles at a faster clip than in years past, in keeping with a broader trend in the industry, analysts and executives said.In some cases, that has led to unresolved glitches that make features like the MyFord Touch entertainment and navigation system tough to operate, according to Consumer Reports magazine and consultant J.D. Power & Associates.""Maybe Ford went too far, too early,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said. But ""if you have a heart-to-heart with Ford management about the issues, they don't give you excuses. They're addressing it. They are not pointing fingers."" The faster pace evokes a broader trend. Since the 2009 economic downturn, major automakers have been launching new models with fewer factories and a smaller supply base, elevating the risk of quality problems in the future.In the 1990s, the average automaker's lineup was between four and five years old in North America, Citi analysts said last month in a research note. That will shorten to between two and three years over the next couple years.But as part of its effort, Ford is now spending more time conducting research before green-lighting a vehicle design. This has lengthened the time it takes Ford to develop a new product, but should ensure the product is top-notch.""We reached the point where we took more time out than we could probably afford to, so we put time back in - based on data, based on learnings from the consumer,"" Hinrichs said.STILL A WAR Analysts added that quality issues are not insurmountable, pointing to Toyota Motor Corp's (7203.T) ability to bounce back from its recent crisis involving sudden unintended acceleration in some vehicles.Despite the problems, Ford's U.S. market share actually grew almost half a percentage point to 15.9 percent last year. But the U.S. auto market is expected to be more competitive this year as sales growth is expected to slow, analysts said.If quality problems persist this year, it may raise questions about Ford's ability to execute the F-150 launch, Guggenheim Securities analyst Matthew Stover said.Company executives are keenly aware of this risk and said that as a result, quality has been a key focus for Ford over the past year. These changes to Ford's quality process will continue throughout 2014.Ford engineers and designers are coordinating efforts earlier in the product development process. They are using 3D technology and other tools that allow Ford to spot and avoid problems from showing up on the assembly line.Each Wednesday, top executives pore over Ford's more than 60 global vehicle programs, focusing on the most troubled ones.Such meetings bring problems to light more quickly and make ""a big organization small,"" said Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields, who started the forum and who also leads it.This year, Ford is launching revamped versions of the F-150 and Mustang sports car, two models that have an outsized effect on consumer perceptions of Ford worldwide.The Mustang will be sold globally for the first time ever. The F-150 is an even bigger challenge because it features an aluminum-alloy body that has triggered changes to the way the trucks are built, repaired and sold.New model launches are something of a specialty for Hinrichs and Nair. When they met around 2002, Hinrichs was in charge of material planning and logistics worldwide for Ford and Nair led new model launches in North America.""Because both of us have been through a lot of launches, we have the emotional resilience that you need to have because every launch is difficult,"" Hinrichs said.""It's like asking, is the war going well?"" Nair added. ""It's still a war.""(Additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit; editing by Matthew Lewis)",2014-01-20,F,"Mon Jan 20, 2014 | 9:03am EST",Ford's 'quality' push comes at busy time for automaker,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-autoshow-ford-quality-idUSBREA0J0V320140120?type=companyNews

""We know how important these launches are.""In the last few years, Ford has tumbled in key reliability surveys due to problems with its touch-screen dashboard system and some of its transmissions. It conducted seven recalls of its Escape crossover since its mid-2012 launch, which may have led to warranty costs of as much as $300 million in 2013.As part of the redoubling of Ford's effort to prevent quality woes, Hinrichs and Nair are drawing on their experience working together in North America and Asia for the last dozen years.Both helped shape Ford's restructuring in North America in 2005 and 2006, when Chief Executive Alan Mulally came on board to steer the automaker's turnaround. In late 2009, they went to Shanghai and spent the better part of a year away from their families to replicate Mulally's ""One Ford"" plan - which unified formerly disconnected business units to gain economies of scale - - in Asia and improve quality.The two now conduct high-level reviews every month or so of all major programs to pinpoint potential problems, a practice that will continue throughout 2014.Over the years, the two have developed an almost intuitive understanding of the other's perspective, Hinrichs and Nair said in a joint interview late last year.Their strong rapport allows them to divvy up duties and work more effectively, they said. So when a scheduling conflict arises, they are comfortable if one of them has to miss a launch review as long as the other person is in the room.""When we look at something, 99 times out of a 100, we're both seeing the same thing,"" Nair said. ""A lot of times, we both don't have to be there because of that.""Then Hinrichs jumped in: ""Which is important because there's only so much time in the day."" NOT POINTING FINGERS The Escape recalls have also been a black eye for Ford and account for most of the $250 million to $300 million in warranty expenses that Ford expects to pay for 2013.These costs could pinch its 2013 operating margin in North America, Ford said last month.Ford's woes largely stem from the fact that it is launching more new vehicles at a faster clip than in years past, in keeping with a broader trend in the industry, analysts and executives said.In some cases, that has led to unresolved glitches that make features like the MyFord Touch entertainment and navigation system tough to operate, according to Consumer Reports magazine and consultant J.D. Power & Associates.""Maybe Ford went too far, too early,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said. But ""if you have a heart-to-heart with Ford management about the issues, they don't give you excuses. They're addressing it. They are not pointing fingers."" The faster pace evokes a broader trend. Since the 2009 economic downturn, major automakers have been launching new models with fewer factories and a smaller supply base, elevating the risk of quality problems in the future.In the 1990s, the average automaker's lineup was between four and five years old in North America, Citi analysts said last month in a research note. That will shorten to between two  and three years over the next couple years.But as part of its effort, Ford is now spending more time conducting research before green-lighting a vehicle design. This has lengthened the time it takes Ford to develop a new product, but should ensure the product is top-notch.""We reached the point where we took more time out than we could probably afford to, so we put time back in - based on data, based on learnings from the consumer,"" Hinrichs said.STILL A WAR  Analysts added that quality issues are not insurmountable, pointing to Toyota Motor Corp's ability to bounce back from its recent crisis involving sudden unintended acceleration in some vehicles.Despite the problems, Ford's U.S. market share actually grew almost half a percentage point to 15.9 percent last year.But the U.S. auto market is expected to be more competitive this year as sales growth is expected to slow, analysts said.If quality problems persist this year, it may raise questions about Ford's ability to execute the F-150 launch, Guggenheim Securities analyst Matthew Stover said.Company executives are keenly aware of this risk and said that as a result, quality has been a key focus for Ford over the past year. These changes to Ford's quality process will continue throughout 2014.Ford engineers and designers are coordinating efforts earlier in the product development process. They are using 3D technology and other tools that allow Ford to spot and avoid problems from showing up on the assembly line.Each Wednesday, top executives pore over Ford's more than 60 global vehicle programs, focusing on the most troubled ones.Such meetings bring problems to light more quickly and make ""a big organization small,"" said Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields, who started the forum and who also leads it.This year, Ford is launching revamped versions of the F-150 and Mustang sports car, two models that have an outsized effect on consumer perceptions of Ford worldwide.The Mustang will be sold globally for the first time ever. The F-150 is an even bigger challenge because it features an aluminum-alloy body that has triggered changes to the way the trucks are built, repaired and sold.New model launches are something of a specialty for Hinrichs and Nair. When they met around 2002, Hinrichs was in charge of material planning and logistics worldwide for Ford and Nair led new model launches in North America.""Because both of us have been through a lot of launches, we have the emotional resilience that you need to have because every launch is difficult,"" Hinrichs said.""It's like asking, is the war going well?"" Nair added.

58,"  MOSCOW Russia plans to support its struggling auto industry with subsidies of up to 271 billion roubles ($8 billion) in the three years to 2016, the government said.Russian car sales fell in 2013 and face another weak year as a stuttering economy puts off buyers, according to lobby group the Association of European Businesses (AEB).The subsidies will be for research and development, to support jobs and to compensate for some costs related to meeting tighter exhaust emission standards, the government said in a statement on its web site.Russia's largest carmaker is Avtovaz, maker of the Lada, which is set to be controlled by Franco-Japanese alliance Renault-Nissan (RENA.PA) (7201.T) by mid-2014. Other foreign carmakers have invested heavily in the country, such as Ford (F.N) and General Motors (GM.N).Russia introduced a recycling fee for imported cars in 2012, angering the European Union which argued the fee - to cover the cost of scrapping a car when it becomes too old to drive - was not compatible with Russia's membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The United States and Japan also complained about the levy.The Russian government responded last year by saying it would apply the same fee to all cars - whether imported or manufactured in Russia - and some analysts said the latest support was a way of offsetting the cost for domestic carmakers.""The introduction of subsidies will reinstate such government support to the industry at no additional cost to the budget,"" analysts at Bank of America said in a research note. The WTO was not immediately available for comment.Russia last year tried to prop up car sales with credit incentives. The program ended in December. The government said Russia aimed to increase production of cars to 3.1 million units a year and light commercial vehicles to 280,000 units per year, without giving comparative figures.Data from the AEB last week said car and light commercial vehicle sales are expected to fall by 1.6 percent in Russia in 2014 to 2.73 million units.($1 = 33.5492 Russian roubles)(Reporting by Megan Davies, Additional reporting by Gleb Stolyarov; Editing by Polina Devitt, Douglas Busvine and Mark Potter)",2014-01-20,F,"Mon Jan 20, 2014 | 6:18am EST",Russia to support domestic car industry with subsidies,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-russia-autos-idUSBREA0J0LF20140120?type=companyNews
59,"   By Cameron French | TORONTO  TORONTO Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who pledged last year to go clean after a crack-smoking scandal, admitted on Tuesday he had been drinking again after a video surfaced of him ranting about police surveillance in a mock Jamaican accent in a suburban eatery.Asked by reporters outside his office at city hall if he had been drinking, Ford said, ""Yes I was ... Little bit, yeah.""In the video, shot from a low angle and posted on YouTube on Tuesday, Ford stands by the counter of a fast-food restaurant and rants about surveillance that police carried out last year during a drug investigation.""Chase me around five months, man,"" he said, before using a Jamaican profanity. In much of the approximately 1 minute-long video, Ford speaks in a Jamaican accent. ""He's hiding here, I'm hiding here. You know how much money that costs?"" Asked about the video, shot at the Steak Queen restaurant in the western suburb of Etobicoke, Ford admitted it was filmed after he was out socializing on Monday night.""I was with some friends. If I speak that way it's how I speak with some of my friends. I don't think it's discriminative at all ... It's my own time,"" he said. In November, Ford said he had smoked crack while in a ""drunken stupor"" and had driven after drinking. Those admissions came after police revealed they had a video of the mayor smoking what appeared to be crack. The video had been uncovered in the course of a drug probe.Ford, who has registered to run in this year's municipal election, has maintained he is not addicted to drugs or alcohol, and said in late November he had stopped drinking completely. An attempt to reach Ford's spokesman was unsuccessful.The crack scandal, as well as other embarrassments including a separate expletive-laden video where an admittedly intoxicated Ford makes threats against unspecified people, made Ford the target of late-night TV lampooning. Toronto's city council has reduced his powers and handed much of his responsibility to Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly.Earlier on Tuesday, Doug Ford, the mayor's brother and a city councillor, told reporters the video could not have been shot on Monday and said the mayor had given up drinking ""100 percent.(Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson and David Gregorio)",2014-01-21,F,"Tue Jan 21, 2014 | 5:52pm EST","Toronto mayor, caught ranting on video, admits drinking a 'little bit'",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-toronto-mayor-idUSBREA0K1T120140121?type=companyNews

64,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | DETROIT  DETROIT Jan 23 Ford Motor Co on Thursday unveiled a family-oriented version of its Lincoln Navigator, a big, brawny sport-utility vehicle that defined the upscale Lincoln brand during the American SUV boom more than a decade ago.The 2015 Navigator comes as the No. 2 U.S. automaker tries to redefine Lincoln as a sleeker, more refined brand with upgraded service and new models such as the MKZ mid-sized sedan and upcoming MKC compact crossover.That effort got off to a slow start last year when a shortage of parts and problems in manufacturing delayed the MKZ's launch. Lincoln sales fell 0.6 percent last year compared with a 7.6 percent rise in the broader U.S. auto market.But Navigator sales rose 3 percent, and Ford is hoping to build on that with an updated version to attract drivers aged 50 to 55 years - about five to 10 years younger than the average Lincoln buyer. ""What started out as a more single-based, young professional vehicle has transitioned to more of a family-based vehicle,"" said Andrew Frick, Lincoln's group marketing manager told reporters at the unveiling.Ford and rivals such as General Motors Co enjoyed wide profit margins on SUVs when the boom began in the late 1990s. Margins on the Navigator, first introduced in 1997, could be as much $15,000, making it one of Ford's most profitable models. Over the next few years, annual U.S. sales of luxury, full-size SUVs such as the Navigator are likely to grow to about 55,000 vehicles from around 50,000 vehicles at present, Frick said.The 2015 Navigator seats eight and has new suspension, a smaller, turbo-charged engine and a new front grille. The grille has the same split-wing design seen on other redesigned Lincoln models, but in a nod to the SUV's past, the grille is stronger and more formal than other redesigned models, said Lincoln chief designer Max Wolff.""Maybe these have taken up that sort of '60s, '70s very exuberant, almost outlandish kind of American sedan,"" Wolff said. ""That doesn't really survive anymore. These have probably taken its place.""Among present-day Navigator buyers, look, power and capability are more important than factors such as fuel economy, said Elaine Bannon, the 2015 Navigator's chief engineer.",2014-01-23,F,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 1:26am EST",Ford unveils family-oriented Navigator SUV to boost Lincoln brand,http://www.reuters.com//article/autos-lincoln-navigator-idUSL2N0KX09N20140123?type=companyNews
65,"   By Deepa Seetharaman | NEW ORLEANS  NEW ORLEANS Ford Motor Co told dealers on Sunday that the radical redesign of the upcoming F-150 pickup will be easier and cheaper to repair than the outgoing model, helping hold down insurance costs for buyers.Ford touted the savings for customers as a selling point, and the company pledged to help dealers defray expenses of up to $50,000 that some will need to pay for tools and equipment to certify their repair shops for the new truck.The new F-150's body is 95 percent made of a military grade aluminum alloy used in Humvees and weighs up to 700 pounds less than the current truck. It was redesigned in a ""modular"" fashion that allows dealers and repair shops to save hours on fixes.Among the most important changes is the front structure that holds the fender, Ford global marketing chief Jim Farley said. This piece is no longer welded, and can be taken off the truck, shaving six to seven hours from average repair time on that part.""You'll see the dramatic changes we made that will really help save a lot of labor costs in the repairability of the vehicle,"" Farley said after meeting with dealers at the annual National Automobile Dealers Association conference. Ford launched the truck at the Detroit auto show this month and it will appear in showrooms late this year. Ford's display at the NADA conference features a deconstructed F-150 shaded in different colors to illustrate the modular redesign.The so-called ""B-pillar"" that slices between the front and rear doors was painted green and affixed with a sign saying it can be replaced without disturbing the roof. The A-pillar or roof rail tube can be sectioned off for repairs. The more extensive use of aluminum in the new F-150 requires dealers and repair shops to use different repair tools. But many already have experience with aluminum because it is used in the hood of the current F-150 and in other models on the road.Just 20 percent of dealers have a collision shop to make fixes to major dents and dings in these work trucks. Independent shops handle the majority of such repairs.It may cost a dealer between $30,000 and $50,000 to be certified to do repairs on the new F-150, but that range applies to dealers who are ""starting from scratch,"" executives said. Independent shops will also have to be certified by Ford. The No. 2 U.S. automaker told dealers it would defray up to 20 percent, or $10,000, of the cost of certification.It is unclear what the cost of insuring the new truck will be, but executives said costs will be ""competitive"" with rivals. The new truck's modular design help lower overall costs and hold down insurance costs, according to one dealer at the meeting.""They think (insurance costs) will be same or possibly even less because Ford has done this in a modular way,"" said Todd Citron, a Ford dealer in Lafayette, Louisiana.

Last year, Ford closed its British van factory in Southampton, southern England, and shuttered an associated stamping facility in Dagenham, east London, ending its vehicle manufacturing in Britain.     The firm still employs nearly 15,000 people around the country, who mainly build and develop engines, and supports a further 100,000 jobs through its network of suppliers and dealers, the company said on its website.      Unite national officer Roger Maddison said staff in Britain had felt the brunt of previous closures and now wanted safeguards.      ""After successive rounds of job cuts including the closure of the Southampton plant, staff now want Ford to make some commitments to job security going forward,"" he said.      The union said it also wanted improvements to the pension scheme which it said uses the consumer price index (CPI) rather than the generally higher retail price index (RPI) for inflation-linked increases to pension payments.      Roughly 300 staff represented by the GMB Union will also be balloted with the vote due to close on Feb. 7, a spokesman said.     In a statement, a Ford spokesman said it had a long-established practice of negotiating with unions in Britain and that further discussions with them were needed.      ""In 2011, a two-year agreement was reached and we re-entered discussions in 2013, recognising the priority for industry-leading levels of cost, efficiency and competitiveness,"" a spokesman said.      ""This process has been completed for some employees but is still under way between the company and unions for other areas of the workforce.""     Unite said it would not comment on any possible strike dates or how long action could last when asked by Reuters.

69,"  Jan 27 Ford Motor Co will showcase a global compact concept car at the New Delhi auto show next month, highlighting a design direction that could spearhead the company's efforts to tap growing demand for small cars in India and other emerging markets.The concept car will provide a glimpse into the kind of vehicle that Ford expects to play an important role in the Asia  Pacific region, set to account for nearly a third of the company's global sales volume by mid-decade, it said.""The concept (car) will showcase Ford's vision for the future in the competitive compact-car segment in India and other dynamic emerging markets,"" it said in a statement, without disclosing what innovative features would be included in the vehicle.Ford expects compact car sales to double from last year to about 2 million vehicles in 2018 in India, where automakers sold 2.7 million passenger vehicles in fiscal 2013. The smallest car among Ford's current Indian products is the Figo hatchback. It was not clear whether the potential new vehicle would be a replacement for the Figo or suggests an additional product.The compact car segment made up almost a third of 2013 total sales in India, Ford said. Most Indians prefer to drive cheaper, fuel-efficient small cars, in a country where roads are clogged with traffic and parking in big cities is hard to come by. Sales of smaller cars, excluding the ultra-cheap Nano from Tata Motors, have risen slightly so far this fiscal year that started in April, versus a near 6 percent drop in demand for passenger vehicles, data from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers shows.Strong demand for small entry-level sedans such as Honda Motor Co's Amaze are helping hold up sales.Ford India is riding on robust demand for its EcoSport compact sport-utility vehicle, which was launched in the country last year.",2014-01-27,F,"Mon Jan 27, 2014 | 8:01am EST",Ford to unveil new compact car concept at Indian auto show,http://www.reuters.com//article/ford-conceptcar-idUSL3N0L132H20140127?type=companyNews
70,"  By Ben Klayman and Bernie WoodallDEARBORN, Mich. Jan 28 Ford Motor Co  reported higher-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday as earnings in its core North American market fell less steeply than Wall Street expected, but declining vehicle prices there raised concerns about 2014.The No. 2 U.S. automaker also affirmed the 2014 profit outlook it presented to investors last month.Ford has described 2014 as a transition period that will test the strength of Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally's team and the company's restructuring since he took over in 2006. This year will also bring the critical introduction of the redesigned F-150 full-size pickup truck in the fall.Guggenheim Securities analyst Matthew Stover said Ford's first quarterly drop in North American vehicle pricing in five years was ominous.""It sort of foreshadows what we will see in 2014,"" he said. ""North America is going through a churn, and international operations are not going to be strong enough to offset that.""Ford said last month that vehicle pricing in the U.S. market would be ""slightly unfavorable"" in 2014. That combined with the cost of introducing 23 new vehicles and a deteriorating Venezuelan economy would dent its profit this year, the company said.On Tuesday, shares of Ford were up 0.2 percent at $15.74 in midday trading.Ford's net income in the fourth quarter rose to $3 billion, or 74 cents a share, from almost $1.6 billion, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier.The results included a $2.1 billion gain from the addition of deferred tax assets to the balance sheet, as well as charges of $311 million for last year's pension buyouts and plant closures in Europe.Excluding one-time items, Ford earned 31 cents a share, 3 cents more than analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had expected. Analysts also attributed some of the outperformance to a lower-than-expected tax rate. Revenue rose 4 percent to $37.6 billion, above analysts' estimates of $35.17 billion.In North America, Ford's pretax earnings were $1.7 billion, a decline of $200 million, as vehicle pricing fell for the first time in five years due to increased competition. However, the profit was higher than expectations of $1.5 billion by RBC Capital Markets and $1.43 billion by Barclays.Citi analyst Itay Michaeli said the pricing declines for the industry tended to hit small and mid-size cars and small crossover vehicles. However, pricing remains strong for larger SUVs and pickup trucks for now, he added.The lower pricing for Ford led South Texas Money Management to sell some of its stake in the company, said Leah Bennett, the San Antonio firm's co-chief investment officer.""I think they're going to be more vulnerable to opportunistic pricing from the Japanese automakers,"" she said. In fact, Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo in a research note urged investors to sell Ford shares, saying increased downtime for the F-150 launch could reduce North American pretax profit by $800 million this year.Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks declined to discuss the financial impact of the truck changeover, but added the launch was largely the reason for the operating profit decline the company has forecast in North America. He added 2014 would be an ""atypical year"" for Ford due to the product introductions and uncertain South American economies.For the fourth quarter, Ford reported a wider-than-expected loss of $126 million for South America, compared with a year-earlier profit. Its $571 million loss in Europe, though smaller than in the previous year, was still wider than analysts had expected. Earnings in Asia Pacific Africa surged more than 170 percent to $106 million.BUSY YEAR  Ford's 2013 pretax profit of $8.57 billion was the second-highest in the last decade, trailing only 2011's $8.76 billion.On Tuesday, Ford said it still expected global pretax earnings of between $7 billion and $8 billion this year, with lower auto operating margins.The company has said 2014 will be the busiest launch year in its 111-year history. Of the 16 new vehicles slated for North America, its most-watched will be the next version of the F-150 truck, which is the best-selling pickup in North America and a big profit center for the company.Ford has reduced the weight of the new truck by using more aluminum than in the current models.F-150 production will be down this year for 11 weeks at Ford's truck plant in Dearborn and two weeks at a Kansas City, Missouri, factory to prepare for the new version, Shanks said. Three of those shutdown weeks in Dearborn will occur in the first quarter.Last year, the F-150 assembly plants had five weeks of downtime, four of which occurred during the normal summer shutdown.Guggenheim's Stover said Ford was more likely taking the downtime in the first quarter to reduce inventory of the truck and not for the changeover to the new model.Ford said its global pension plans were underfunded by $9 billion at the end of 2013, an improvement of $10 billion from the end of 2012 and $1 billion better than it had previously forecast.Of the $9 billion pension shortfall, $6 billion was for plans the company does not have to contribute to in advance. Shanks said that meant Ford would have more cash to invest because it only had to fund $3 billion upfront.Ford also said that because of its 2013 earnings, it would make record profit-sharing payments of about $8,800 per person to about 47,000 U.S. hourly employees.",2014-01-28,F,"Tue Jan 28, 2014 | 2:01pm EST",RPT-UPDATE 4-Ford posts higher profit but faces pressure in U.S.,http://www.reuters.com//article/autos-ford-results-idUSL2N0L21G620140128?type=companyNews

Shanks said that meant Ford would have more cash to invest because it only had to fund $3 billion upfront.Ford also said that because of its 2013 earnings, it would make record profit-sharing payments of about $8,800 per person to about 47,000 U.S. hourly employees.(Reporting by Ben Klayman and Bernie Woodall; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",2014-01-29,F,"Tue Jan 28, 2014 | 8:56pm EST",Ford posts higher profit but faces pressure in U.S.,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-autos-ford-results-idUSBREA0R0RJ20140129?type=companyNews

79,"  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) is spending $80 million to boost production of large pickups and SUVs this year at its Louisville truck plant, the U.S. automaker said Thursday.The Kentucky facility, one of two Ford plants in Louisville, last year built 353,662 vehicles. Most of those were Ford's popular F-Series Super Duty, a bigger, brawnier sibling to the company's mainstay F-150 pickup.The truck plant, which opened in 1969 and has been running close to its rated annual capacity of 365,000, will hike that by 55,000 to 420,000, Ford said. The plant will add 350 jobs to its current workforce of nearly 4,000.Ford did not provide further details about the timeline of the expansion plans.The F-Series Super Duty accounted for the bulk of production last year in Louisville, at 272,521, according to data from Automotive News. The plant also built 78,500 Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs. The standard F-150 is being redesigned late this year, with most of its steel body panels being replaced with lighter-weight aluminum.The Super Duty pickups aren't slated for a major overhaul until late 2015 when they, too, are expected to feature more aluminum. The Expedition and Navigator SUVs will be restyled and updated this fall for the 2015 model year. They sell in much smaller numbers than the Super Duty, which includes the F-250, F-350, F-450 and F-550 pickups. Many of those trucks are purchased by commercial users, including construction workers and small-business owners.The mildly revised 2015 F-Series Super Duty goes on sale this spring, with a more powerful 6.7-liter V8 turbo-diesel engine and greater towing capacity. Ford does not break out sales of the Super Duty models from the standard F-Series. The full line continues to be the best-selling vehicle in the U.S., with sales last year jumping 18 percent to 763,402.Expedition sales in 2013 rose 1 percent to 38,350 in 2013, while Navigator sales increased 3 percent to 8,613.(Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli)",2014-01-30,F,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 11:02am EST",Ford to boost large truck production at Kentucky plant,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-autos-ford-kentucky-idUSBREA0T1A520140130?type=companyNews
80,"  (Corrects paragraph 3 to show premium-luxury segment accounted for 46 percent of total new-vehicle income, not revenue)By Bernie WoodallJan 30 AutoNation Inc, the largest U.S. automobile dealer group, sped by Wall Street earnings expectations on Thursday on robust sales of luxury cars like Mercedes-Benz and BMW.""The shining star really's got to be Mercedes-Benz for introducing two new products simultaneously at different ends of the spectrum with the CLA and the S-Class,"" said AutoNation Chief Operating Officer Mike Maroone in a telephone interview. ""Demand for those products was extraordinary.""AutoNation said its fourth-quarter income from what it calls premium-luxury new vehicles increased 28 percent to $102.7 million. The segment accounted for 46 percent of total new-vehicle income.The CLA is an ""entry-level"" vehicle costing about $30,000 and the S-Class sedan is the flagship of Daimler AG's  Mercedes-Benz brand. The average purchase price for an S-Class sedan is $94,000, according to TrueCar.com. Mercedes-Benz vehicles accounted for 10 percent of AutoNation's new-vehicle sales in the quarter, and BMW accounted for 5.6 percent. Toyota Motor Corp's namesake brand were 18.6 percent of the company's quarterly new-vehicle sales, followed by Ford Motor Co products at 16.5 percent, Honda Motor Co's namesake brand at 11 percent, Nissan Motor Co's  Nissan brand at 10 percent.AutoNation showed net income of $109.4 million, or 89 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, versus $83.2 million, or 67 cents per share a year ago.Adjusted income excluding a tax benefit of 3 cents per share and gains linked to changes in owning property of 4 cents per share was 83 cents per share and beat analysts' expectations of 76 cents per share, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was $4.52 billion, which missed analysts' expectations of $4.59 billion, but beat year-ago results of $4.17 billion. AutoNation is based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.CEO WARNS AUTOMAKERS AGAIN  AutoNation Chief Executive Mike Jackson, who used to run the Mercedes-Benz brand for Daimler in the United States, has been warning for several months that high inventories can bite into profits for automakers and dealer groups. He did so again in a telephone interview on Thursday.""I'm overall very optimistic, very positive,"" said Jackson. ""I'm just observing that taking inventories to these levels is an inefficiency that we should really focus on this year and bring it back in line. One of the reasons to speak up is to make sure that we don't end up with even higher inventories.""Jackson fears that automakers, particularly the mass-market brands, will exceed demand with production, which could cause them to layer on heavy consumer incentives to move product on dealer lots.Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting at LMC Automotive, said while there should be concern, he is confident that automakers will be disciplined on incentives, which they generally have been since the 2008-2010 downturn in the U.S. new-vehicle business.""Even if we have a weather-induced slowdown from January, which I think we will have, I don't think over-inventory is going to plague the auto industry this year,"" Schuster said in a telephone interview on Thursday.

82,"   By Ben Klayman, Bernie Woodall and Deepa Seetharaman | DETROIT  DETROIT Four of the top five U.S. auto sellers on Monday blamed extreme winter weather for poorer-than-expected sales in January, as analysts and executives predicted a rebound in February and March.U.S. automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co as well as Japan's Toyota Motor Sales USA and American Honda Motor Co saw auto sales plummet in January, missing analysts' estimates for the month.Sales results were mixed for other companies and brands, with Chrysler Group, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, and Nissan North America reporting increases and topping forecasts.Total industry sales in January, as compiled by Reuters from the manufacturers, fell 3.1 percent to 1,011,188.""The bad weather only seemed to affect our competitors' stores,"" teased Chrysler as it reported double-digit sales increases for its Jeep and Ram truck brands.John Mendel, head of Honda's U.S. sales operation, said: ""January's foul weather cooled things a bit,"" adding that ""we look forward to a warming trend"" in the coming months.While snow and bone-chilling weather drove total U.S. auto sales down about 3 percent for the month, analysts said any dip in January sales should not cut into the industry's months-long rebound, which has been outpacing the recovery of the overall U.S. economy since the 2008-10 downturn.""The weather's an easy scapegoat - it will be interesting to watch February and March to see if those lost sales in January get made up,"" said Larry Dominique, executive vice president at industry researcher TrueCar.Fred Diaz, an executive at Nissan, said: ""I don't think those sales are gone for good. I think February is going to be a good month for the entire industry.""Morgan Stanley estimated industry sales in January were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 15.2 million, well below analysts' consensus of 15.7 million. There was little consistency, however, in the initial January sales reports.""It's tough to make any declarative statement"" about the disparity in automakers' sales performances, said Gabelli & Co analyst Brian Sponheimer. ""It's really hard to pull anything out of January that's trend-worthy.""Ford said company sales fell 7.1 percent to 154,644. Analysts polled by Reuters had projected Ford sales of 157,441 in the month.Ford-brand sales dropped 8.4 percent, with declines in such popular models as the Fusion mid-size sedan and the F-Series full-size pickup. But Lincoln brand sales jumped 42.5 percent on the strength of the MKZ sedan and the MKX crossover.GM sales dropped 11.9 percent to 171,486, compared with analysts' average projection of 187,782. All four of GM's U.S. brands saw sales decline in January. Toyota sales fell 7.2 percent in the first month of the year to 146,365, missing analysts' estimate of 153,003, while Honda's sales fell 2.1 percent to 91,631 in January, compared with a projected 97,927.Bucking the downward trend, Chrysler Group's U.S. sales rose 8 percent in the month to 127,183, bolstered by increases at its Jeep and Ram truck brands.Among its bestsellers in January was the new 2014 Jeep Cherokee and sales of the full-size Ram pickup jumped 22 percent, while most rivals in the truck segment reported year-to-year declines.Several analysts observed that full-size pickup pricing is improving with Ford and GM trimming incentive spending on big pickups and selling a richer mix of high-margin truck models.The average transaction price for a Chevrolet Silverado in January was $40,575, up 11.6 percent from a year earlier, according to Kelley Blue Book, an industry research firm. That compares with $40,672 for a Ford F-150, up 0.4 percent; and $37,253 for a Ram 1500, up 2.2 percent. Ford continued to spend heavily on other models, boosting total incentives by 14.6 percent from a year ago, according to TrueCar. In comparison, total incentive spending fell 19.6 percent at Chrysler and 3.6 percent at GM, TrueCar estimated.MIXED RESULTS Among the smaller players, Nissan said sales climbed 11.8 percent to 90,470, above analysts' consensus estimate of 88,744. Sales were driven in part by the Altima mid-size sedan, which beat the Ford Fusion and sold twice as many as the Chevrolet Malibu.Volkswagen of America saw January sales plunge 19.0 percent to 23,494, as its three top sellers - the Golf and Jetta compacts and the mid-size Passat sedan - all fell compared with a year earlier. VW's premium Audi brand said sales remained relatively flat, at 10,101.The BMW group, including Mini, was up 3.0 percent to 20,796, and the Mercedes-Benz group, including Smart, was up 1.5 percent to 24,413.Fuji Heavy Industries' Subaru was up 19.3 percent to 33,000. Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co said January sales for the Hyundai and Kia brands rose 1.3 percent to 81,016.With the sales downturn, inventories rose in January at Ford and GM. Ford said its stock of unsold vehicles at the end of the month rose to 111 days, compared with 89 a year earlier, while GM's climbed to 114 from 95.Chrysler also saw inventories increase to 105 from 87.

83,"   By Lucia Mutikani | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. manufacturing activity slowed sharply in January on the back of the biggest drop in new orders in 33 years while construction spending barely rose in December, pointing to some loss of steam in the economy.Economists largely blamed frigid temperatures for the chill in economic activity and said they expected a rebound in the months ahead. However, they also cautioned that the economy was receiving some payback after a strong performance in the second half of 2013.""The disappointing data provide further confirmation of a dramatic slowing in economic growth momentum,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to 51.3 last month, its lowest level since May 2013, from 56.5 in December.Bad weather also appeared to hurt U.S. auto sales in January, with Ford Motor Co, General Motors Co and Japan's Toyota Motor Sales USA reported a slide in sales for the month.U.S. stocks fell sharply on the manufacturing data, with the Dow Jones industrial average off 1.5 percent and the S&P 500 losing 1.7 percent. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note hit its lowest level since early November and the dollar dropped against a basket of currencies.Mulraine, however, said ""to the extent that this weakening can be attributed to weather-effects, we expect activity to rebound meaningfully in the coming months.""January's ISM figure was also well below the median forecast of 56 in a Reuters poll of economists, missing even the lowest estimate of 54.2. Readings above 50 indicate expansion. It was the second straight month of slowing growth from November's recent peak reading of 57, which had been the highest since April 2011, and indicated manufacturing was slowing after output grew at its fastest pace in nearly two years in the fourth quarter.Underscoring the weather impact, delivery delays increased a bit last month, but the biggest red flag was the huge drop in the forward-looking new orders index, which fell to 51.2 from 64.4 in December. That 13.2-point drop was the largest monthly decline in the key component since December 1980.""While the magnitude of the decline in the ISM index may have exaggerated the degree of cooling in the underlying pace of factory activity, it reinforces our belief that the optimism surrounding a burst of capital investment in 2014 is overdone,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut.Economists also noted that the ISM survey had been running too strong relative to other factory indicators.SLOW FIRST-QUARTER GROWTH EYED  In a separate report, the Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.1 percent in December, slowing from the prior month's 0.8 percent increase.While private construction spending hit a five year high, outlays on public construction projects recorded their biggest drop in a year, reflecting the drag from weak state and local government spending.The soft construction spending data will probably not have much effect on the government's advance fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate as it was broadly in line with assumptions.The government reported last week that the economy grew at a 3.2 percent annual pace, supported by consumer spending, exports and inventory accumulation, after logging a 4.1 percent rate in the prior quarter. It expanded at a brisk 3.7 percent pace in the second half of the year, up sharply from 1.8 percent in the first six months of the year. It was the biggest half-year gain since the second half of 2003.Exports are not expected to match their strong growth and businesses are expected to step back from restocking. When added to the impact of cold weather, that suggests a slowdown in first quarter growth is in the cards, analysts said.Indeed, the ISM survey showed a pullback in new export orders and a contraction in inventories.""An earlier pickup in manufacturing production and inventory building in the second half of 2013 is slowing down,"" said Ryan Wang, a U.S. economist at HSBC in New York.The prices index hit an 11 month high. Economists, however, said that was mostly energy-related after the cold snap caused a shortage of propane and pushed up prices for electricity and heating oil in some parts of the country.An indicator of employment fell to its lowest level since June. Economists said that posed a downside risk to expectations of a rebound in employment in January after a surprise slowdown in December.January's employment report will be released on Friday and is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rebounded to 185,000 in the month from 74,000 in December, according to a Reuters survey.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani and Dan Burns; Editing by Paul Simao)",2014-02-03,F,"Mon Feb 3, 2014 | 1:06pm EST","Factory, construction spending data hint at slowing economy",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-economy-construction-idUSBREA120X320140203?type=companyNews

While private construction spending hit a five year high, outlays on public construction projects recorded their biggest drop in a year, reflecting the drag from weak state and local government spending.The soft construction spending data will probably not have much effect on the government's advance fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate as it was broadly in line with assumptions.The government reported last week that the economy grew at a 3.2 percent annual pace, supported by consumer spending, exports and inventory accumulation, after logging a 4.1 percent rate in the prior quarter.It expanded at a brisk 3.7 percent pace in the second half of the year, up sharply from 1.8 percent in the first six months of the year. It was the biggest half-year gain since the second half of 2003.Exports are not expected to match their strong growth and businesses are expected to step back from restocking. When added to the impact of cold weather, that suggests a slowdown in first quarter growth is in the cards, analysts said.Indeed, the ISM survey showed a pullback in new export orders and a contraction in inventories.""An earlier pickup in manufacturing production and inventory building in the second half of 2013 is slowing down,"" said Ryan Wang, a U.S. economist at HSBC in New York.The prices index hit an 11 month high. Economists, however, said that was mostly energy-related after the cold snap caused a shortage of propane and pushed up prices for electricity and heating oil in some parts of the country.An indicator of employment fell to its lowest level since June. Economists said that posed a downside risk to expectations of a rebound in employment in January after a surprise slowdown in December.January's employment report will be released on Friday and is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rebounded to 185,000 in the month from 74,000 in December, according to a Reuters survey.",2014-02-03,F,"Mon Feb 3, 2014 | 1:04pm EST","WRAPUP 2-U.S. factory, construction spending data hint at slowing economy",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL2N0L80P120140203?type=companyNews
85,"  TORONTO Feb 3 Chrysler Canada said on Monday that its Canadian vehicle sales rose 4 percent in January from a year earlier, buoyed by demand for both trucks and cars.The Chrysler Group company, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, said total sales rose to 17,698 from 17,013 vehicles in the same period last year.Truck sales grew 4 percent to 15,023 vehicles, while car sales climbed 4.2 percent to 2,675 vehicles.

86,"  CHICAGO Fewer U.S. children are dying in car crashes, with death rates falling by 43 percent from 2002 to 2011, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday.But one in three of the children who died in a car crash in 2011 was not using a seat belt or child safety seat, suggesting many more deaths could be prevented, the CDC said. The results were based on a study in the Morbidity and Mortality report, the agency's weekly report on death and disease.According to the report, more than 9,000 children age 12 and younger died in a car crash from 2002 to 2011.""The good news is motor vehicle deaths decreased by 43 percent over the past decade for children age 12 and younger. The tragic news is still with that decrease, more than 9,000 kids were killed on the road in this period,"" CDC Director Thomas Frieden told reporters in a telephone news conference.""Thousands of children are at risk on the road because they are not buckled up,"" he said.The study found that of the children who died between 2009 to 2010, a much higher proportion of black and Hispanic children were not buckled, compared with white kids. ""The difference was nearly half (45 percent for blacks and 46 percent for Hispanics) versus a quarter (26 percent) for white kids,"" Frieden said.The study did not investigate why racial differences played such a big role in seat belt use, but it did suggest socio-economic factors may play a role.For the study, CDC researchers analyzed data collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to find the number of deaths among occupants in cars from 2002 to 2011 for all children aged up to the age of 12. Overall, 9,182 children died in car crashes during the period. But deaths dropped sharply, from 2.2 deaths per 100,000 people in 2002, to 1.2 deaths per 100,000 in 2011, a 43 percent decline.According to the report, seat belt use increased from 88 percent in 2002 to 91 percent in 2011 among all children age 7 and under. The study also confirmed earlier findings that older children are less likely to be wearing seat belts than younger children.To prevent future deaths from car crashes, Frieden said parents should make sure their children use appropriate-sized car seats, booster seats and seat belts on every trip. The CDC recommends that children from birth to age 2 should be in a rear-facing car seat.Starting at age 2, children should be in a forward-facing car seat until at least age 5, or when they reach the upper weight or height limit of that seat.Children age 5 and older should use a booster seat until the adult seat belt fits them properly, generally when the lap belt lays across the upper thighs and the shoulder belt slays across the chest, but not the neck.More information on proper use of child safety seats can be found at www.safekids.org or other websites.(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Editing by Dan Grebler)",2014-02-04,F,"Tue Feb 4, 2014 | 1:17pm EST",Fewer U.S. children dying in car crashes: CDC,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-seatbelts-children-idUSBREA131BO20140204?type=companyNews

91,"   By James B. Kelleher | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Feb 6 Heavy snow and bone-chilling weather this year have taken a toll on Ford Motor Co's  U.S. vehicle production just as the company kicks off the biggest year of new model launches in its history, a top executive said on Thursday.Extreme weather conditions have made it difficult for Ford to get auto parts delivered to plants on time. Ford, Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co and General Motors Co have all had to halt production at times over the last five weeks due to the weather.""We've lost production at a number of facilities,"" Joe Hinrichs, head of Ford's North and South American operations, told reporters. Stoppages occur in ""fits and starts - three hours here, go home early there, because of the network.""Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, has enough vehicles on dealer lots to offset the drop in production, Hinrichs said. The company said this week that its Michigan Assembly Plant, which builds the Focus compact car, will be closed through Sunday due to weather-induced parts shortages.Bad weather discouraged many consumers from going to dealer showrooms in January, several major automakers said this week. As a result, GM, Ford and other companies reported a higher-than-normal level of unsold cars on dealer lots. ""One time northern Indiana went into emergency and you couldn't drive on the roads,"" Hinrichs said. ""Louisville got six inches of snow and it shut down the place. Kansas City shut down the roads the other day.""He added: ""I'll tell you this, in my 20-some years in this industry, I've never seen five weeks like this of weather like this."" The bout of extreme weather will test Ford's ability to ensure its busy year goes off without a hitch. Hinrichs has been a key player in the company's effort to avoid missteps that could undermine or delay the introduction of those new vehicles.So far, Ford's upcoming launches are all on track, including the Lincoln MKC crossover and the highly anticipated revamp of the lucrative and top-selling F-150 pickup truck.The MKC is the second of four models intended to reboot the Lincoln brand's image. Ford tried to relaunch the premium brand in late 2012 with the MKZ sedan, but a shortage of parts and problems in manufacturing delayed the MKZ's launch for months.",2014-02-06,F,"Thu Feb 6, 2014 | 5:35pm EST",Bad weather causing 'fits and starts' in auto output -Ford exec,http://www.reuters.com//article/ford-production-weather-idUSL2N0LB1W320140206?type=companyNews

97,"   By Tom Hals  Feb 10 A Hong Kong bidder for Fisker Automotive has hired former Ford Motor Co executive Martin Leach in anticipation of possibly winning Wednesday's bankruptcy auction for the assets of the defunct maker of a plug-in hybrid sports car.Leach, the former president of Ford's European business, will give added heft to the management of Hybrid Tech Holding LLC, which will square off against a Chinese auto parts company in this week's auction.""I've been working with them for months on a business plan and they have very clear intentions,"" Leach told Reuters.California-based Fisker filed for bankruptcy protection in November. It has not produced its signature Karma sports car since 2012 due to a series of technical glitches and a cash shortage. Hybrid, an affiliate of Hong Kong businessman Richard Li, has offered $55 million for Fisker, while a unit of Wanxiang Group has made an initial bid worth around $35 million.However, Wanxiang has proposed under its bid that Fisker creditors will receive a 20 percent stake in the new Fisker operations, and has argued it will be a better manager of the company's assets. Creditors have sought to sue Li, a former Fisker board member and investor, and other directors and insiders for allegedly causing the company's financial distress.Leach's retention was first reported in the Wall Street Journal, and making it public ahead of the auction could help counter arguments that Wanxiang has the operational edge. In addition to Ford, Leach was also the chief executive of Maserati and is currently chairman of Magma Group, an automotive consultancy he founded.Leach said Hybrid's first task if it wins the auction is to look after existing owners of Fisker cars. ""Then we've got more than 400 suppliers that need to be re-engaged to be able to restart production. That's a big challenge.""One of its key suppliers, battery maker A123 Systems Inc, was bought by Wanxiang in a bankruptcy auction in 2012. Hybrid has said it is exploring a partnership with Boston Power to supply batteries if it wins the auction.Fisker received a controversial U.S. government loan originally worth $529 million in part to help start production at a former General Motors Co plant in Delaware. That factory was never put into production, but both bidders have said they would consider making cars there.",2014-02-10,F,"Mon Feb 10, 2014 | 11:13am EST",Fisker bidder taps former Ford exec to bolster management,http://www.reuters.com//article/fisker-auction-hybrid-idUSL2N0LF0OX20140210?type=companyNews
98,"  * Toyota says exit will affect about 2,500 jobs* Follows similar plans announced last year by GM, Ford* High costs, strong Aussie dollar hurt competitivenessBy Maggie Lu YueyangSYDNEY, Feb 10 Toyota Motor Corp said on Monday it would stop making cars and engines in Australia by the end of 2017, marking the end of an era for a once-vibrant auto production base and the loss of thousands of direct and indirect jobs.Toyota's decision follows the planned exits of General Motors and Ford Motor announced last year and would leave no global automaker remaining in Australia as high costs and a strong currency make it an unattractive production base.""We did everything that we could to transform our business, but the reality is that there are too many factors beyond our control that make it unviable to build cars in Australia,"" Toyota Australia President Max Yasuda said in a statement.About 2,500 jobs will be affected when the plant stops building cars in 2017, the company said.Toyota's exit from Australia after more than half a century there is a setback to Prime Minister Tony Abbott's conservative government, which is seeking to manage a slowdown in the $1.5 trillion economy as a decade-long mining investment boom slows. ""This is obviously devastating news for everyone involved with Toyota. It's devastating for me and for the government,"" Abbott said in Canberra.Union leaders were more vocal in their criticism of the government's handling of the auto industry's woes.""The loss of the automotive manufacturing industry in Australia will have far reaching consequences around the country and throughout the economy,"" said Australia Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) Secretary David Oliver.""They've (the government) done absolutely nothing to keep Toyota in this country,"" he added, warning that A$21 billion ($18.80 billion) would be wiped from the economy and that some regions would go into recession. The ACTU groups the main Australian trade unions under an umbrella group.BLOW TO MANUFACTURING A pullout by Toyota had been widely feared because of the blow to the parts supply base from the flight of GM and Ford. ""It's a huge moment for industry in Australia,"" Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane told reporters in Canberra after Toyota's announcement.""Toyota have made no requests to us other than express their frustration with the difficulty they were having with the industrial relations process,"" he said, when asked whether Toyota had sought financial assistance or other forms of aid.Australia's car industry includes about 150 companies working in sectors from components to tooling, design and engineering, with more than 45,000 people employed directly in the car and parts-making sectors, according to government data.While Australians bought a record 1.14 vehicles last year, according to the Australian Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries, the proportion made domestically was a record low at barely 10 percent. Toyota was the top-selling brand, holding nearly one-fifth of the market.Vehicle production in Australia has nearly halved in the past decade to just above 200,000 in 2012 from more than 400,000 in 2004. Sales of locally made vehicles have suffered in recent years as a stronger Australian dollar makes imported cars more competitive.In contrast, global automakers have been building new factories and ramping up capacity in countries like Indonesia, where a burgeoning middle class and lower costs make it an increasingly attractive production base.",2014-02-10,F,"Mon Feb 10, 2014 | 3:49am EST",UPDATE 2-Toyota to stop making cars in Australia from 2017,http://www.reuters.com//article/toyota-australia-idUSL3N0LF21Z20140210?type=companyNews
99,"   By James Pomfret, Norihiko Shirouzu and Laurence Frost | SHENZHEN, China/PARIS  SHENZHEN, China/PARIS Aston Martin's sweeping recall of its high-end sports cars last week raises larger questions about the risk to global automakers of sourcing key parts thousands of miles away in China without implementing adequate quality control measures.Executives from several major foreign automakers said they either shun Chinese-owned suppliers or help them establish sound production processes and train workers to avoid quality problems.And some traders in one of China's largest plastics supply hubs told a Reuters reporter during a recent visit that counterfeit plastic material of the kind found in an accelerator pedal supplied to Aston Martin was widespread as manufacturers face increasing cost pressures.The China Association of Automotive Manufacturers, which represents many of the country's vehicle and parts makers, declined to comment.The British maker of the exotic sports cars featured in a string of James Bond spy movies was forced last week to recall most of the vehicles it has built since 2007. It discovered Chinese subcontractors were using counterfeit plastic material in parts supplied to Aston Martin.An spokeswoman for Aston Martin, controlled by Kuwaiti and private equity investors, said on February 7 that the Chinese sub-suppliers of accelerator pedal arms are being replaced ""as soon as possible"" by a U.K.-based supplier.The source of Aston Martin's recall ""is precisely why we don't procure much in China"", especially from Chinese-owned component makers, a China-based senior Toyota Motor Co (7203.T) executive told Reuters. He declined to be named because of the sensitive nature of the issue.Toyota, which has extensive manufacturing activities in China, buys most critical components from China-based units of Japanese and other global parts producers. In some cases it brings in materials directly from Japan, the Toyota official said.""There is risk in expanding our procurement reach within China,"" the official said. ""When we do buy from Chinese suppliers, we do so only after starting small with a simpler component and taking time to nurture them.""A Toyota spokeswoman in Tokyo declined to comment on issues related to the Aston Martin recall.QUALITY CONTROL One company aggressively expanding purchases of parts from what it calls ""pure Chinese-owned"" parts producers is Japan's Nissan Motor Co (7201.T), an affiliate of French automaker Renault SA (RENA.PA).To prevent the kind of issue Aston Martin has faced with defective accelerator pedals, Nissan routinely sends engineers into supplier factories to reinforce quality control, its purchasing executives and engineers in China have told Reuters.Nissan declined to comment on the Aston Martin recall and its implications for other carmakers. Germany's Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), which holds a minority stake in Aston Martin and operates several joint ventures with Renault-Nissan, said it was not affected by the Aston Martin recall and does not share the British company's Chinese suppliers of accelerator pedals.Jaguar Land Rover Ltd TAMOJL.UL in the UK said it had ""never used"" Aston Martin's Chinese suppliers. Now owned by India's Tata Group, JLR was part of Ford Motor Co's (F.N) Premier Automotive Group, along with Aston Martin. Ford sold Aston Martin in 2007 and JLR in 2008.Even Chinese-owned Covpress, a U.K.-based supplier of pedal assemblies and other parts to automakers including General Motors Co (GM.N), Renault and Jaguar Land Rover, said it avoids manufacturing in China altogether to ""allay fears"" about supply chain security.""We buy the tooling to make things over there, but that's it - we don't actually make anything over there,"" Chief Executive Officer Kit Halliday told Reuters. ""There is no product that we have in the U.K. that we would consider making in China.""According to documents filed with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Aston Martin found that Shenzhen Kexiang Mould Tool Co Ltd, a southern China-based subcontractor that moulds the affected accelerator pedal arms, was using counterfeit DuPont (DD.N) plastic material. The material was supplied by another southern China-based firm, Synthetic Plastic Raw Material Co Ltd of Dongguan, according to the documents.Kexiang was contracted to mould accelerator pedal arms by a Hong Kong company, Fast Forward Tooling, which in turn was contracted by a U.K.-based manufacturer, Precision Varionic International, according to Aston Martin documents filed withNHTSA. COUNTERFEIT PROTECTION  Plastics supplier DuPont said it is working with Aston Martin to help ensure the material used to manufacture the pedals is genuine DuPont product.""The best protection that customers and end-users have against counterfeit products and the potential consequences of their use in highly engineered systems is to ensure that they and their supply chains buy only from DuPont and their authorized distributors,"" it said in a statement.A Precision Varionic official, Ursula Aldridge, said PVI had no comment. Quality management chief John Penman and manufacturing and purchasing director Roger Osborn did not respond to requests for comment.Calls to the listed number for Kexiang's small factory in Shenzhen went unanswered. People seen inside the factory during a recent visit by Reuters declined to answer questions.Zhang Ronghui, a Kexiang factory manager absent from the site but contacted by Reuters on his mobile phone, said he was aware of the recall of Aston Martin parts, but denied any direct involvement with the British carmaker. ""We're fine. We don't make things (for Aston Martin). Another company does it,"" said Zhang, who declined a request for a meeting.Attempts to contact Fast Forward Tooling and Synthetic Plastic Raw Material weren't successful. A visit to the Hong Kong address for Fast Forward cited in Aston Martin's document found it to be that of a small legal and secretarial firm where the company had registered its business but had no actual presence.Aston Martin spokeswoman Sarah Calam said the Chinese sub-suppliers Fast Forward and Kexiang are being replaced, with production shifting to the U.K. The automaker will continue working with Precision Varionic. In the meantime, she said, both Aston Martin and DuPont have sent people to China to directly supervise the production of all pedal arms, including verifying that each bag of DuPont-branded plastic material is genuine.As a widely practiced protocol, upper-tier suppliers such as Precision Varionic have responsibility to verify the quality of so-called sub-assemblies provided by lower-tier subcontractors, according to Matteo Fini, senior supply chain consultant with IHS Automotive in London.""The more one goes down the chain, the less transparent and visible the chain becomes,"" Fini said.Aston Martin purchasing director Gary Archer told Reuters on February 7 that ""supply chain management is a big challenge for all car makers"", but said the company has a robust quality-control system to monitor its suppliers.The carmaker's spokeswoman Calam acknowledged the complicated nature of managing an extensive automotive supply chain. ""It does become more difficult when you think we have over 200 tier-one suppliers, and they each have their own networks of suppliers,"" she said. ""Obviously it gets harder to control the tier-three and tier-four (suppliers) down the chain.""SHABBY WORKSHOP The complicated task facing a smaller automaker - particularly one with a reputation for iconic design and high-end performance such as Aston Martin - was on full display during the recent visit by Reuters to a factory operated by southern China subcontractor Kexiang.Kexiang is located in Bao'an, on the outskirts of the boomtown of Shenzhen, in China's ""world factory"" industrial belt in the Pearl River delta that churns out a quarter of China's exports.The company operates a small and shabby ground-floor workshop inside a squat pink-tiled building with dirty windows and exposed electrical wiring on its outer walls.The factory compound was accessible through an unmanned guard post and a free-swinging gate, though a metal grille to the factory floor was shuttered during China's annual Lunar New Year holiday. Several people inside the building ignored requests for access.Synthetic Plastic Raw Material, the firm that allegedly provided the counterfeit plastics to Kexiang, couldn't be immediately located in the sprawling Zhangmutou Plastics Logistics City in Dongguan, where it is based.

The Edge competes in what Ford calls the global utility segment, whose sales rose 13 percent last year.

106,"  BERLIN Ford (F.N) increased European car sales by 9.2 percent in January, the eighth straight monthly gain, benefiting from strong demand in the region's top markets Germany and the UK.Deliveries in the so-called Euro-20 markets, including all major countries plus the Baltic states, increased to 80,800 autos from 74,000 a year earlier, Ford Europe said on Friday.The 9.2 percent gain, powered by demand for models such as the Kuga SUV and the Fiesta compact, is about twice the size of overall market growth in that region, Ford said.Ford's loss-making European division is counting on new models and a stabilizing market to increase sales this year, after shrinking demand inflicted a 2.1 percent drop in 2013 deliveries. ""We've launched 11 new vehicles over the past 15 months, and we'll launch more than 10 additional new vehicles in 2014 alone,"" Ford Europe sales chief Roelant de Waard said. The U.S. carmaker's sales in Germany surged 38 percent to 16,800 vehicles while the UK, Ford's biggest market in the region, posted an 11 percent gain to 26,800.Ford has closed two UK production sites and will shutter a major assembly plant in Genk, Belgium, this year, eliminating about 6,200 jobs in total. The company's fourth-quarter 2013 European loss of $571 million, though smaller than in the previous year, was still wider than analysts had expected.(Reporting by Andreas Cremer; Editing by Victoria Bryan)",2014-02-14,F,"Fri Feb 14, 2014 | 7:02am EST","Ford European sales up 9.2 percent in January on German, UK demand",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-fordeurope-carsales-idUSBREA1D0OT20140214?type=companyNews
107,"  (Adds report of QNX deal with Ford, background, share price move)Feb 24 BlackBerry Ltd  will make its BBM messaging tool available to Microsoft Corp's  Windows Phone and the upcoming Nokia X platforms in the coming months in a move to widen the user base, the smartphone maker said on Monday.The announcement, coupled with a report that auto maker Ford Motor Co plans to base its next-generation Sync system on BlackBerry's QNX operating system and no longer use Microsoft's Windows platform, helped send shares of BlackBerry up 8 percent in midday trading.Bloomberg said using QNX would be cheaper than licensing Microsoft technology and would improve the flexibility and speed of the next Sync system. The report cited sources briefed on the matter who requested anonymity because the decision was not public.BlackBerry and Ford declined to comment on the report. Shares of BlackBerry rose 8.4 percent to $9.91 on Nasdaq following the news on Monday. Its Toronto-listed shares rose 7.7 percent to C$10.95.Reaching a deal with Ford would be a coup for BlackBerry, which is trying to reinvent itself as more of a software and services company after its smartphones have lost market share to Apple Inc's iPhone and a slew of devices powered by Google Inc's market-dominating Android platform. Still, its BBM offering remains popular. Waterloo, Ontario-based BlackBerry opened the service to the Android and iOS platforms late last year, and the number of active users has increased to more than 80 million.BBM, or BlackBerry Messaging, offers collaboration tools such as BBM Groups, BBM Voice and BBM Channels and competes with services such as WhatsApp, which Facebook said last week it would buy for $19 billion. BBM will be available as a free download from the Windows Phone Store this summer, while BBM for Nokia X will be available from the Nokia Store when the Nokia X platform launches, BlackBerry said in a statement on Monday.BBM was a pioneering mobile-messaging service, but its user base has failed to keep pace with those of WhatsApp and other rivals, in part because BlackBerry had long refused to open the program to users on other platforms.WhatsApp, with a user base of about 450 million, has grown rapidly. Its service works with iOS, Android and devices powered by the Windows and BlackBerry platforms.

108,"  * Heaviest discounts offered on GM, Ford pickups* Bad weather continues to keep shoppers away* U.S. auto industry sales were likely flat in February -analystsBy Paul LienertDETROIT, Feb 27 General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co this week ramped up deep discounts on many of their U.S. models, extending those offers through March in an effort to lure customers back into winter-ravaged showrooms.Some of the heaviest discounts are being offered by Ford and Chevrolet dealers on full-size pickups - $8,000 and more on the 2014 Ford F-150 and $9,000 and more on the 2014 Chevrolet Silverado, according to Internet listings posted Thursday.But U.S. dealers also are sweetening deals on a wider range of vehicles, from low-priced economy cars such as the Chevrolet Sonic to popular crossovers such as the Ford Escape, fueling fears of an escalating ""discount war"" among the bigger manufacturers.The latest offers come as the Detroit automakers and a number of their competitors appear to have been slammed by a third straight month of extreme weather in many parts of the United States, causing inventories of unsold vehicles to remain at unseasonably high levels.""We believe short-term pent-up demand is building, but it's difficult to know when it will be released,"" said analyst Joseph Spak of RBC Capital Markets. ""It could be March or spread out over a few months (and) is also likely dependent on the weather.""Analysts polled by Reuters estimated U.S. vehicle sales in February will be relatively flat from a year ago, at around 1,196,000, representing an annualized rate of 15.4 million. After dismal sales in January, analysts had predicted an uptick in February.BALANCING ACT  The challenge for GM and Ford has been to maintain a delicate balance between pricing and discounts, one of the key incentives offered by the industry. This task is made a bit easier with big pickups, high-margin vehicles that traditionally provide the lion's share of pretax profit in Detroit.Automakers were able to maintain record transaction prices in February, with the industry average topping $29,000, according to research firm J.D. Power.GM, which introduced its redesigned Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups last summer, has seen the biggest gain - around $5,000 per vehicle - in truck prices from a year ago, according to research firm Kelley Blue Book.Because it has been spending relatively less on incentives this year than Ford, GM's share of full-size truck sales has dropped several points to less than 35 percent.GM spent an estimated $3,204 per vehicle in incentives in February, compared with $3,305 for Ford, according to research firm TrueCar. That could change as GM phases out heavy-duty versions of the Silverado and Sierra this spring while building up production of redesigned editions.Analyst Brian Johnson of Barclays Capital said U.S. vehicle inventories are down slightly from January, but so far the automakers have maintained relatively strong first-quarter production schedules.""Should inventory levels remain elevated through April, we could see the issue addressed"" via higher incentives or production cuts, Johnson said.FURIOUS DISCOUNTING BY DEALERS At the retail level, discounting continues at a furious pace, judging from dealer websites reviewed Thursday by Reuters. Chevrolet dealers were offering promotional deals on a wide range of models as the GM brand wrapped up a nationwide Presidents Day sale and prepared for two new March promotions.The new promotions are dubbed Chevy Truck Month and Chevy Open House, according to trade publication Automotive News. The March incentive programs are expected to provide discounts of up to $7,000 or more per vehicle, according to a GM source who declined to be named because the programs have not been formally announced.A number of Chevrolet dealers in the meantime are offering even better deals, many of them over the Internet.On Thursday, David Stanley Chevrolet in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, advertised a 2014 Silverado for $27,900, or $9,260 off the sticker price.In Chandler, Arizona, Thoroughbred Chevrolet advertised a 2014 Malibu sedan at $17,395, or $5,860 off sticker, and a 2014 Sonic hatchback for $10,495, or $4,500 off.Ford has boosted and extended discounts on many of its U.S. models through March 31. The company now is offering rebates of up to $4,000 on the full-size 2014 F-150 pickup and as much as $6,000 on selected models such as the 2014 Focus Electric.But Ford dealers across the United States continue to advertise even steeper discounts on the Web.Hall Ford Lincoln in Newport News, Virginia, on Thursday was offering a 2014 Ford Taurus Limited sedan for $34,000, a discount of $6,090 off the suggested retail price, and a 2014 Escape SEL crossover for $29,000, a discount of $5,600.Brandon Ford in Tampa, Florida offered deep discounts of up to $7,200 on the 2014 F-150 pickup and $8,360 on the heavy-duty F-150.Will the discount wars continue beyond March? That depends on the weather and on whether a ""bounceback"" in demand materializes, analysts said. As RBC analyst Spak noted:  ""Incentives, once introduced, can be hard to pull back.""",2014-02-27,F,"Thu Feb 27, 2014 | 4:56pm EST",U.S. automakers extend discount wars through March,http://www.reuters.com//article/autos-detroit-discounts-idUSL1N0LW1HY20140227?type=companyNews
109,"  * Third straight month of weaker-than-expected sales* Incentives used to attract shoppers during cold winter* GM, Ford, Chrysler, Nissan top sales expectations* Toyota, Honda fall short of forecasts* Industry in good shape heading into March -Ford execBy Bernie Woodall and Ben KlaymanDETROIT, March 3 U.S. auto sales in February finished even with the year-earlier period as hefty incentives to lure customers into dealerships late in the month could not overcome cold and snowy weather.February's sales fell less than 300 vehicles from last year's 1,193,872 light cars and trucks. While General Motors Co , Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Group all reported stronger-than-expected sales, the higher incentives raised concerns about industry profitability in the future.The annualized sales rate for the month finished at 15.34 million vehicles, just short of the 15.4 million expected by analysts polled by Reuters. It was the third month in a row that U.S. auto industry sales were weaker than expected.The frost on sales for January and February will thaw in March as temperatures rise and customers return to showrooms in greater numbers, some industry analysts said.However, late February's high customer incentives, the discounts to encourage buyers to visit showrooms, will carry over into March, cutting in to companies' profit, several analysts said.Larry Dominique, executive vice president of industry research firm TrueCar, said there are about 80 days of supply on dealer lots, compared with a more desirable level of 60 to 65 days.""We have on average two-and-a-half months of supply on dealer lots,"" said Dominique, adding that most automakers have not cut production, which will lead to even more oversupply, which will increase pressure to raise incentive levels further.Dominique pointed out that companies book the sales for their balance sheets on the wholesale level, so ""every field agent for every manufacturer"" is going to press dealers to take more vehicles when they are already oversupplied. Monthly auto sales are typically an early indicator of consumer demand. But January and February are usually two of the slowest sales months every year.OLD HABITS DIE HARD? ""The fear is going back to the old ways of having to sell the deal and not the car after years of staying clean,"" said Jesse Toprak, chief analyst for research firm Cars.com. ""(Dealers) don't want the companies to fall off the wagon when it comes to incentives.""For now, the incentives are not out of control, but Toprak warned, ""it might get a bit out of control this summer and beyond if the pace of inventory accumulation does not slow down.""Industrywide, the average incentive in February was about $2,633 per vehicle, up 5 percent from a year earlier and up 3.3 percent from January, according to TrueCar.Partly offsetting the higher incentives was a 3.6 percent rise in average transaction prices, or the figures at which autos are sold. Unlike January and February, March is often one of the best months for U.S. auto sales. The fact that March has five weekends also bodes well for the U.S. auto industry, said John Felice, Ford's U.S. sales chief.""Despite all the challenges, it was a robust market,"" Felice said of February, ""and we feel that as we head into March we'll be in very good shape.""SILVERADO SLIDES GM's U.S. sales in February dipped 1 percent but easily beat analysts' expectations of a 6 percent slide, with sales of 222,104 vehicles.While GM's Malibu, Cruze and Sonic passenger cars each posted double-digit gains, sales of the company's top-selling Chevy Silverado pickup truck fell 12 percent. The Silverado's slide compares with a rise of 2.6 percent for Ford's F-Series pickups and a gain of 26 percent for Chrysler's Ram 1500 pickup. GM officials said they trimmed incentives on their trucks from January even as their rivals boosted them. However, Kelley Blue Book analyst Alec Gutierrez said the problem was that GM's new trucks were not enough of a departure from their rivals' current models to make a huge difference.""They are only marginally better than Ford's previous generation truck and the new Ram,"" he said, referring to the Silverado. He added that there was nothing to suggest a consumer should pay a premium for the Silverado.In a research note last week, Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said intense competition in the segment has left GM with the ""least successful large pickup truck launch over the last 15 years in terms of share and pricing."" While the Detroit company has been able to raise prices, it has cut incentives more slowly than with full-size truck launches in the past.FORD SLIGHTLY BEATS, TOYOTA MISSES Ford slightly beat expectations last month by posting U.S. sales of 183,947 vehicles, down 6 percent from a year earlier. Ford is the second-largest in the U.S. market by sales.GM and Ford, which ranks second in the U.S. market, are offering some of the heftiest incentives.Toyota Motor Corp, the No. 3 seller in the U.S. auto market, saw February sales fall 4 percent at 154,866 vehicles, widely missing expectations of no change from a year ago. Honda Motor Co reported a 7 percent sales decline that also missed analysts' estimates.U.S. February sales of Chrysler Group and Nissan Motor Co  topped analysts' expectations.Chrysler, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, said demand for its two top-selling Jeep models, the Grand Cherokee and the Cherokee SUVs, had helped push its total monthly sales up 11 percent to 154,866 vehicles. Analysts had expected a rise of 8 percent.Nissan showed a gain of 16 percent, led by a 73 percent jump in sales of its Rogue crossover vehicle. Analysts had expected an increase of 12 percent.Volkswagen AG reported U.S. sales of 27,112, down 14 percent. Its best-selling vehicle, the Jetta, had sales of 11,908, down 0.5 percent.GM shares were down 0.1 percent at $36.15 and Ford shares were down 1.2 percent at $15.20 in late afternoon trading on the  New York Stock Exchange.",2014-03-03,F,"Mon Mar 3, 2014 | 3:55pm EST","UPDATE 6-U.S. auto sales flat, incentives could hit profit",http://www.reuters.com//article/autos-ussales-idUSL1N0M01N520140303?type=companyNews

His 2012 compensation was cut by 29 percent to about $21 million, based on share values last March, that included salary, stock awards, stock options and other perks.Mulally's pay was reduced in 2012 in part because Ford missed some key goals for market share, profit and cash flow.GM has said CEO Mary Barra will be paid up to $14.4 million in cash and stock this year, including $10 million under the company's long-term compensation plan that is still subject to shareholder approval in June.Mark Fields, Ford's chief operating officer, was awarded $4.6 million worth of shares for last year's work and now owns $12.8 million in common shares of the company.Joe Hinrichs, head of North and South American operations, was awarded $2.2 million of shares for 2013 performance, and now owns $5 million in common shares in Ford.",2014-03-06,F,"Thu Mar 6, 2014 | 6:02pm EST",UPDATE 1-Ford CEO Mulally gets $13.8 mln in stock for 2013 performance,http://www.reuters.com//article/autos-ford-ceo-idUSL1N0M32I820140306?type=companyNews

121,"   By Paul Lienert and Ben Klayman | DETROIT  DETROIT General Motors Co (GM.N) ratcheted up discounts in February on its full-size pickups, but it is telling Wall Street analysts that it intends to maintain premium pricing and margins on the trucks despite a drop in volume and market share.On Tuesday, Chuck Stevens, GM's new chief financial officer and a key member of CEO Mary Barra's executive team, was dispatched to New York to update Wall Street analysts on the automaker's financial outlook, including the performance of its big trucks.A key message, according to analysts: GM remains focused on maintaining pricing ""discipline,"" especially on the hugely profitable full-size pickups in a highly combustible and fluid U.S. market.GM is ""working on marketing strategies to gain traction at the lower end of the (pickup) market without giving up pricing gains at the high end,"" said UBS Securities in a Wednesday client note.Analysts reacted guardedly to the message and observed that GM revealed few details about recent incentives.New data on February sales incentives, released to Reuters late on Wednesday by two industry research firms, shows rising discounts on GM trucks.Average per-vehicle discounts on GM's 2014 Chevrolet Silverado pickup jumped more than $500 to $4,218 in February, from $3,715 in January, according to Autodata, even as Silverado sales fell 12 percent from February 2013 and Chevrolet's share of the full-size truck segment dropped more than three percentage points to 22.5 percent. In comparison, Ford Motor Co (F.N) sliced discounts in February on its industry-leading F-series pickups to $2,835. F-series sales rose nearly 3 percent from the previous year, commanding more than 34 percent of the segment.GM redesigned the Silverado and GMC Sierra last summer. Ford plans to introduced a redesigned F-150 late this year.GM confirmed the meeting between Wall Street and CFO Stevens. A GM spokesman, asked about the February incentives, said spending rose in February to help reduce inventories of older heavy-duty versions of the Silverado and Sierra as the redesigned heavy-duty versions began to arrive at U.S. dealers. The average truck incentives at GM were skewed by much higher discounts averaging up to $5,972 on the heavy-duty Silverado 2500HD and 3500HD models, which commercial buyers prefer, and lower discounts of $3,593 on the light-duty Silverado 1500, aimed at consumers, according to research firm Edmunds.com.GM has a bit more room to maneuver on sales incentives, including rebates, because its average per-vehicle transaction prices, which include any discounts, remain higher than Ford's.In February, GM boasted one of the industry's highest average transaction prices on its U.S. vehicles: $34,090, down a fraction from $34,306 in January. In comparison, Ford's ATP rose slightly to $32,625, from $32,307 in January, according to research firm TrueCar.GM's pricing edge has an upside and a downside: While the automaker says it still can't build enough of its more expensive high-end trucks, sales of low-end V6 models are still weak. Analysts left the meeting with the GM CFO without major concerns.Barclays auto analyst Brian Johnson, in a Wednesday client note after the GM briefing, said that GM's beefy transaction prices, especially on high-margin pickups, ""provide some room for increased incentive use if needed"" later in the year.Both Chevrolet and Ford dealers have been offering fat discounts of $9,000 and more on their big trucks, with dealers contributing a portion of the savings.GM's and Ford's full-size trucks are among the most profitable vehicles in the industry, accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. automakers' global pre-tax earnings even though they make up just 16 percent of North American vehicle production.Goldman Sachs analyst Patrick Archambault, in a client note, said ""the stage (is) set for year-on-year margin acceleration"" at GM in the second and third quarters, driven in part by the recent launch of the heavy-duty Silverado and Sierra pickups and companion Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe and GMC Yukon full-size SUVs.(Reporting by Paul Lienert and Ben Klayman in Detroit, editing by Peter Henderson)",2014-03-06,F,"Wed Mar 5, 2014 | 8:59pm EST",Exclusive: GM ratchets up truck discounts as U.S. sales skid,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-autos-gm-trucks-idUSBREA2503M20140306?type=companyNews

125,"  * Ford of Canada, Unifor union say deal has drawbacks* S. Korea has little appetite for Canadian vehicles* Canada needs more trade pacts to compete, analysts say* Auto sector employed 117,200 in Canada last yearBy Susan TaylorTORONTO, March 11 A new free trade agreement with South Korea will throw a wrench into Canada's auto sector recovery, union leaders and an  automaker warned on Tuesday, highlighting the pressure on an industry already struggling with competition from Mexico.The pact, which immediately drew fire from Ford Motor Co of Canada Ltd and Canada's largest private-sector union, underscores problems with the size and cost of cars being produced in the country's industrial heartland, experts said.""We don't, in Canada, build the type of vehicles that are much in demand in South Korea,"" said Tony Faria, a University of Windsor professor and auto industry expert. ""It's not as if any trade deal we set up with South Korea is necessarily going to result in more vehicles being exported.""Canada and South Korea said earlier on Tuesday they had wrapped up talks on a long-delayed free trade deal, Canada's first in fast-growing Asia. Canada's Conservative government touted the benefits of the deal, which is expected to boost farm product exports.But Unifor, a union representing more than 39,000 workers in the country's auto sector, estimates that 33,000 manufacturing jobs in Canada could be lost from the pact, including up to 4,000 auto assembly and parts jobs.""I wouldn't say it's the death of the industry, but it's another nail (in the coffin),"" said Jerry Dias, Unifor's national president.In 2013, the auto sector employed 117,200 people in Canada, according to Statistics Canada. Some 96,700 of those jobs, or nearly 83 percent, were in Ontario, the most populous province. Ford Canada Chief Executive Dianne Craig was equally harsh.""No Canadian manufacturer can compete with a market controlled by non-tariff barriers and currency manipulation. The trade agreement negotiated by the Canadian government with South Korea fails to address these issues,"" she said in a statement.Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said that Ford was being hypocritical given its support for the U.S.-Korea free trade deal.Ontario's government was disappointed that the 6.1 percent tariff on South Korean auto imports will be phased out in three annual cuts and not a longer period. South Korea's 9 percent tariff on imports will be eliminated immediately.Ontario's Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Employment, Eric Hoskins, said he was also unhappy that Canada was unable to negotiate the same ""snap-back provision"" included in the U.S.-Korea deal. Such snap-backs would roll back tariff reductions if it was shown that Korea used non-tariff barriers to protect its market. LONG-TERM DECLINE Canadians bought more new vehicles in 2013 than ever before, as consumers brushed off high debt to buy more trucks and luxury vehicles. Sales jumped 4 percent, topping the previous record-setting year in 2002.Still, Canada's auto industry has seen a slow, long-term decline, in terms of its share of North American auto production and investment.Since the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed 20 years ago, auto production in Mexico has more than tripled, while production in Canada has only edged higher, Scotiabank senior economist Carlos Gomes said in a report.""Your problem is Mexico at this point, it really, really is,"" said Sean McAlinden, chief economist of the Center for Automotive Research, who pointed to a surge of production plant investment in the low-cost jurisdiction.Within two years, Mexico will likely produce two cars for every vehicle assembled in Canada, he said.

126,"   By David Ljunggren | OTTAWA, March 11  OTTAWA, March 11 Canada and South Korea announced on Tuesday they had wrapped up talks on a long-delayed free trade deal which had stalled for years amid squabbles over exports of autos and beef.The deal - outlined in a statement by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper - is particularly important for Canada, which is trying to cut its reliance on the U.S. market.The agreement is the first Canada has concluded with a nation from Asia, a fast-growing part of the world that Ottawa is deliberately targeting.Canada's Trade Ministry says exports to South Korea in 2012 were worth C$3.7 billion ($3.4 billion) while imports from South Korea hit C$6.4 billion.Canadian exports though have steadily dropped since a free trade deal between the United States and South Korea came into effect in March 2012.The talks with South Korea began in 2005, but later stalled over disputes about auto exports and a delay by Seoul in scrapping its ban on Canadian beef. South Korea lifted its nine-year-old ban in 2012. Canada says the deal will boost exports by 32 percent, equivalent to C$1.7 billion a year. South Korean exports should grow by 20 percent a year, or around C$1.3 billion.South Korea will remove duties on 98.2 percent of its tariff lines, covering virtually all Canadian exports.""Given that the average of Korea's tariffs are currently three times higher than Canada's (13.3 percent versus 4.3 percent), tariff elimination will be particularly advantageous for Canadian businesses,"" the government said in a statement.The deal will hearten Canadian pork producers, who say their exports have plunged since the U.S. deal with South Korea came into effect. But some auto makers with Canadian operations, such as Ford Motor Co., will be less happy. The deal means Canada will remove its 6.1 percent tariff on imports from firms such as Kia Motors Corp and Hyundai Corp.This, some firms worry, will prompt a flood of South Korean imports. Ford notes that Canada imported around 131,000 South Korean vehicles in 2012 while exporting just 3,000.The 6.1 percent tariff will be eliminated over three years but this may not be enough to assuage Ford. International Trade Minister Ed Fast told CTV television on Sunday that the deal would reflect many of the auto industry concerns. ""My role isn't simply to promote the narrow interests of the auto sector itself. My role is to promote the national interests. Virtually every other sector of our economy has told us this trade agreement is absolutely critical,"" he said.Japanese auto makers with Canadian operations initially opposed the deal but later changed their minds on the grounds that the Canadian deal with South Korea could pave the way for one with Japan.Canadian officials downplay the potential damage to the auto industry, noting that 88 percent of Canadian-made vehicles are already exported.The agreement is relatively minor compared with a similar pact Canada agreed in principle last year with the European Union, one which the two sides say could boost bilateral trade in goods and services by a fifth to 25.7 billion euros ($35 billion) a year.Fast told CTV that Canada and South Korea hoped the deal would formally come into effect next year.",2014-03-11,F,"Tue Mar 11, 2014 | 1:30am EDT","Canada, South Korea conclude long-delayed free trade deal",http://www.reuters.com//article/canada-korea-trade-idUSL2N0M71PF20140311?type=companyNews
127,"  * Ford of Canada, Unifor union say deal has drawbacks* S. Korea has little appetite for Canadian vehicles* Canada needs more trade pacts to compete, analysts say* Auto sector employed 117,200 in Canada last yearBy Susan TaylorTORONTO, March 11 A new free trade agreement with South Korea will throw a wrench into Canada's auto sector recovery, union leaders and an automaker warned on Tuesday, highlighting the pressure on an industry already struggling with competition from Mexico.The pact, which immediately drew fire from Ford Motor Co  of Canada Ltd and Canada's largest private-sector union, underscores problems with the size and cost of cars being produced in the country's industrial heartland, experts said.""We don't, in Canada, build the type of vehicles that are much in demand in South Korea,"" said Tony Faria, a University of Windsor professor and auto industry expert. ""It's not as if any trade deal we set up with South Korea is necessarily going to result in more vehicles being exported.""Canada and South Korea said earlier on Tuesday they had wrapped up talks on a long-delayed free trade deal, Canada's first in fast-growing Asia. Canada's Conservative government touted the benefits of the deal, which it expects to boost exports by 32 percent, equivalent to C$1.7 billion ($1.53 billion) a year.But Unifor, a union representing more than 39,000 workers in the country's auto sector, estimates that 33,000 manufacturing jobs in Canada could be lost from the pact, including up to 4,000 auto assembly and parts jobs.""I wouldn't say it's the death of the industry, but it's another nail (in the coffin),"" said Jerry Dias, Unifor's national president.The federal government pointed to a 2012 study prepared by a University of Toronto professor for the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, which concluded the elimination of the tariff on vehicles imported from South Korea would have only a modest impact on domestic production, cutting output by just over 4,000 vehicles.In 2013, the auto sector employed 117,200 people in Canada, according to Statistics Canada. Some 96,700 of those jobs, or nearly 83 percent, were in Ontario, the most populous province. Ford Canada Chief Executive Officer Dianne Craig was also harsh in her view of the deal.""No Canadian manufacturer can compete with a market controlled by non-tariff barriers and currency manipulation. The trade agreement negotiated by the Canadian government with South Korea fails to address these issues,"" she said in a statement.Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said that Ford was being hypocritical given its support for the U.S.-Korea free trade deal.Ontario's government was disappointed that the 6.1 percent tariff on South Korean auto imports will be phased out in three annual cuts and not a longer period. South Korea's 9 percent tariff on imports will be eliminated immediately.Ontario's Minister of Economic Development, Trade and Employment Eric Hoskins, said he was also unhappy that Canada was unable to negotiate the same ""snap-back provision"" included in the U.S.-Korea deal. Such snap-backs would roll back tariff reductions if it was shown that Korea used non-tariff barriers to protect its market.A spokesman for Canadian International Trade Minister Ed Fast said the government believed the Canadian agreement is as strong, and in some areas stronger, than the U.S. agreement when it comes to dealing with non-tariff barriers. LONG-TERM DECLINE Canadians bought more new vehicles in 2013 than ever before, as consumers brushed off high debt to buy more trucks and luxury vehicles. Sales jumped 4 percent, topping the previous record-setting year in 2002.Still, Canada's auto industry has seen a slow, long-term decline, in terms of its share of North American auto production and investment.Since the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed 20 years ago, auto production in Mexico has more than tripled, while production in Canada has only edged higher, Scotiabank senior economist Carlos Gomes said in a report.""Your problem is Mexico at this point, it really, really is,"" said Sean McAlinden, chief economist of the Center for Automotive Research, who pointed to a surge of production plant investment in the low-cost jurisdiction.

128,"  FRANKFURT Ford (F.N) increased European car sales by 11.6 percent in February, the brand's ninth straight monthly gain, fueled by demand for compact vehicles and SUVs.Deliveries in the so-called Euro-20 markets, including all major countries plus the Baltic states, rose to 69,900 models, extending the two-month gain to 10.4 percent or 150,800 autos, Ford Europe said on Friday.Top-selling models last month include the Fiesta compact and Kuga SUV, deliveries of which were up 16 percent and 43 percent respectively, Ford said. Ford delivered 12,700 units in its top U.K. market in February, flat on year-ago levels, and posted a 17 percent gain in Germany, its No. 2 European market, to 16,700 cars. Ford's loss-making European division is counting on new models and a stabilizing market to increase sales this year, after shrinking demand inflicted a 2.1 percent drop in 2013 deliveries.

129,"  * Spain, Portugal, Ireland sales growth in double digits* Toyota, GM, Ford, Renault lead February's increase* French auto sales dip 1.4 pct; Germany's underperformBy Agnieszka FlakMILAN, March 18 European car sales rose 7.6 percent in February, as a gradual economic recovery in Portugal, Spain and Italy boosted demand for mass-market brands, industry data showed on Tuesday.New passenger-car registrations in the European Union and European Free Trade Association trading bloc rose for the sixth straight month to 894,730 vehicles in February from 831,371 in February a year ago, according to data from the Association of European Carmakers (ACEA). Europe's car industry endured a six-year slump, with auto sales falling to a two-decade low, as austerity-hit consumers cut back on expensive purchases. Now the market is starting to grow again.""As the year progresses, we would expect the car market continuing to pick up because the economy is starting to move in the right direction,"" said Jonathon Poskitt, head of European forecasting for LMC Automotive. Selling rates in western Europe clawed their way back to mid-2012 levels, he said.""People are going to feel more confident to make that big-ticket purchase, such as a car, that they've been holding off on because of the concerns over their employment prospects and their income,"" he said. At the Geneva auto show earlier this month, executives said they were encouraged by the recovery in crisis-hit European countries, although they were worried that volatile emerging markets could overshadow the gains.Registrations in Germany, the top car market, underperformed the regional trend, with a 4.3 percent increase, and fell by 1.4 percent in Europe's second-biggest car market, France. But sales grew by double digits in some states most hit by the crisis.Sales grew 17.8 percent in Spain, 40.2 percent in Portugal and 20.6 percent in Ireland, signalling that a fragile recovery in the region was gaining strength. In Italy, the region's fourth-biggest market, sales grew 8.6 percent as the country recovers from its longest recession in 70 years. ""We keep forecasting an ongoing improvement of the underlying sales trend,"" ISI Group said in a note. ""In addition, we keep highlighting improved vehicle pricing in tandem with better residual values and sales channel mix.""Sales at Renault Group jumped 11.5 percent, boosted mainly by a 33.6 percent surge in registrations of its no-frills Dacia brand. Ford sales were up 11.3 percent. Toyota Group, the world's biggest-selling car maker, posted a 14 percent increase, and General Motors saw sales go up 12.3 percent, boosted by a 15.6 percent increase in registrations of its Opel- and Vauxhall-branded vehicles.Germany's Volkswagen group, Europe's biggest carmaker by volume, posted a 7.2 percent rise, helped by a 21.5 increase at its value brand Skoda, a 15.7 percent jump in Seat sales and an 11.8 percent gain at its premium brand, Audi. VW's performance was weighed down by a 0.8 percent decline in sales at its namesake brand.French carmaker PSA lost some market share in February. Its overall sales grew 3.5 percent, supported by an increase in registrations of its Peugeot brand, but sales of Citroen-branded cars were roughly flat year-on-year.The long-awaited revival of the European market seems to be on track, with almost all countries and manufacturers performing better. But industry players urge caution, pointing out the gain comes from historic lows. In Italy, for example, car sales are recovering from levels last seen in the 1970s.""Sales have effectively been growing, but discounting practices have been following a very similar path, it seems,"" Carlos Da Silva, an analyst with market researchers IHS Automotive, said in a note. ""This would tend to indicate that the overall situation remains more tense than it might appear.""",2014-03-18,F,"Tue Mar 18, 2014 | 6:54am EDT",REFILE-UPDATE 1-European car sales up for sixth month as economies recover,http://www.reuters.com//article/acea-carsales-february-idUSL6N0MF1AE20140318?type=companyNews
130,"  (Adds comments from Ford's lawyer)By Allison MartellTORONTO, March 19 A video obtained by police last year shows Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, who has admitted to using crack cocaine, inhaling some kind of vapor from a glass cylinder, according to police documents unsealed on Wednesday.The documents also said some of Ford's meetings and calls with friend and occasional driver Sandro Lisi were ""indicative to that of drug trafficking"" and showed that police asked for a warrant to access some of Ford's phone records.The mayor has not been charged in the investigation, and allegations in the documents have not been proven in court.Ford, who is running for re-election, made international headlines last May when media blog Gawker and the Toronto Star newspaper said they had seen a video that appeared to show him smoking crack. In October, Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair said his force had obtained a video consistent with media reports, but did not describe it in detail. Days later, Ford admitted he had smoked crack, probably in a ""drunken stupor.""""The video appears to have been filmed surreptitiously showing Mayor Ford consuming what appears to be a narcotic,"" said the documents released on Wednesday. According to the documents, the mayor holds a lighter and what looks like a glass cylinder. He ""holds the glass cylinder to his mouth. Lights the lighter and applies the flame to the tip of the glass cylinder in a circular motion,"" and a few seconds later appears to inhale.""This is old news. I don't know why everyone's rehashing this,"" said Dennis Morris, Ford's criminal lawyer, in an interview with local network CP24. Morris said the police clearly do not have enough evidence to lay charges.""The mayor is the victim, and I don't know why they're pursuing him,"" he said. The documents are linked to Project Brazen Two, an ongoing investigation by Toronto police that has already resulted in extortion charges against Lisi.In October, Lisi was charged with extortion for actions police allege he took while trying to retrieve the video, and he has separately been charged with drug trafficking. When he was charged with extortion, he did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations.Portions of the documents released last year showed that the mayor had been under surveillance for months, but Toronto Police have not said whether they believe Ford played any role in the scheme.Several local media outlets teamed up and went to court to have the documents unsealed. The group is still seeking access to other, related documents.

141,"  * Automaker seeks 44 pct rise in SE Asia sales over 3 years* Plans to double capacity to 100,000 vehicles per year   (Adds company confirmation, industry context)By Yoko KubotaTOKYO, March 31 Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp  said it has bought the site of a former auto plant in the Philippines from Ford Motor Co, beefing up production as it targets a near-50 percent sales boost in fast-growing Southeast Asia markets.Mitsubishi Motors, the second-biggest automaker in the Philippines by sales volume after Toyota Motor Corp, said on Monday it will centre its Philippines production at the plant in Laguna from January 2015. The plant will have an annual capacity of about 50,000 vehicles, gradually rising to around 100,000 vehicles. As part of the strategy, the auto maker will close and sell its ageing existing Philippines plant in Rizal, spokeswoman Tomoko Kawabe said. Mitsubishi Motors declined to say how much it paid to buy the Laguna plant, where Ford made sports utility vehicles until December 2012.The move by Mitsubishi Motors, maker of Triton pickup trucks and Outlander SUVs, adds to growing competition among global car makers in the populous Southeast Asia region, dominated by Toyota and other Japanese car makers. ""We are planning to prepare for future growth in the Philippines, whose auto market is likely to continue grow sustainably,"" the company said in a statement.For second-tier car makers like Mitsubishi Motors and Suzuki Motor Corp, Southeast Asia offers a major opportunity as they seek to compensate for shrinking sales in their ageing domestic market. The region now accounts for a quarter of Mitsubishi Motors' global vehicle sales. Mitsubishi Motors has a plan to expand regional sales by 44 percent over three years to end-March 2017. In the Philippines it currently makes vehicles including the Lancer EX sedan and the Adventure SUV.Non-Japanese car makers are also seeking to build up their regional presence. Last year, Volkswagen AG set up distribution channels in Philippines, while General Motors  has been stepping up its efforts to sell cars in the region including Indonesia.Shares in Mitsubishi Motors rose 1.9 percent in morning trade to 1,077 yen, outperforming the Nikkei benchmark's  0.4 percent gain.

Ford has announced 4.5 billion reais of investments in Brazil from 2011 to 2015 as it brings local offerings up to global standards.President Dilma Rousseff's government has used import tariffs and tax incentives to prod global carmakers into opening new local factories and increasing domestic content. However, tighter credit and falling consumer confidence weighed on domestic demand at the start of this year, dragging new vehicles sales 2.1 percent lower in the first quarter compared to a year earlier. The drop in demand for heavy trucks has been even more dramatic, with sales falling 11.3 percent in the quarter. Truck makers including Ford, Scania and Mercedes-Benz have responded by slowing assembly lines, but Golfarb said the worst may be over this year for the Brazilian truck market, thanks to a new credit policy from state development bank BNDES.""The full impact is still not clear, but we're already seeing a recovery,"" he said.

163,"   By Will Dunham | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON You've heard of the Model T Ford, the famed early 20th-century automobile that was the forerunner of the modern car. But how about the Model T shark?Scientists on Wednesday announced the discovery of the impeccably preserved fossilized remains of a shark that lived 325 million years ago in what is now Arkansas, complete with a series of cartilage arches that supported its gills and jaws.Because shark skeletons are made of soft cartilage, not hard bone, finding anything more than scrappy fossilized remains of teeth and vertebrae is rare. Finding a fossil shark in an almost three-dimensional state of preservation, boasting important skeletal structures, is exceptional.This primitive shark, named Ozarcus mapesae, may lead scientists to rethink shark evolution, erasing the notion that these beasts of the deep have remained little changed since they first appeared at least 420 million years ago.""These things have been very successful, among the top predators in the Earth's oceans, for over 400 million years,"" said paleontologist John Maisey of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, one of the researchers.""The best analogy I can come up with is this: It's like comparing a Model T Ford with a modern automobile. They are both recognizably the same kind of thing. But they are completely different under the hood. We found the Model T of sharks,"" added Maisey, whose research was published in the journal Nature. Those cartilage arches, for example, are quite different from those in modern sharks, the scientists said. This suggests that while their general outward appearance has stayed roughly the same, important changes have occurred over time that have helped make sharks the perfect eating machines of the sea.Maisey said Ozarcus mapesae was small by shark standards - about 2 to 3 feet long, with relatively big eyes. It swam in the murky waters of a shallow inland sea teeming with life including other fish and squid-like creatures in shells.It is not the oldest shark fossil, but it is the oldest to reveal all of the anatomy of the skeleton supporting the gill arches, a vitally important element of a fish. SOPHISTICATED EQUIPMENT Employing sophisticated equipment at the European Synchrotron in France, the scientists used high-resolution X-rays to obtain a detailed view of the shape and organization of the arches and associated structures.They found that the arrangement was unlike that of modern sharks but was very much like that of bony fishes like today's tuna or swordfish. Maisey said that scientists had viewed today's sharks as very primitive creatures while seeing bony fish as more advanced. ""Modern sharks cannot be considered anymore as living fossils that did not evolve since their origin. They are actually very derived compared to early cartilaginous fishes,"" said American Museum of Natural History paleontologist Alan Pradel, another of the researchers.Sharks have undergone many other changes since the time of Ozarcus mapesae, the researchers said.Their jaws are no longer firmly bound to the cranium, giving them greater biting freedom.

170,"  BEIJING, April 20 China is set to surpass the United States to become Volvo Car Group's biggest market in 2014 with sales of at least 80,000 cars in the world's largest auto market.Its car sales target for 2014 is around a third higher than the 61,146 cars sold in 2013, while sales in the United States in 2014 are expected to increase only in line with the broader market, it said in a statement on Sunday.

171,"  (Adds details about Mulally, Ford annual meeting, company historical stock performance)By Ben KlaymanDETROIT, April 21 Ford Motor Co will soon name Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields as successor to Chief Executive Alan Mulally, a person familiar with the plans said on Monday.Mulally, the 68-year-old executive credited with reviving Ford's fortunes since taking its helm in 2006, will step down before the end of the year, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing the company's plans. Fields, 53, was named COO in December 2012 and has been seen as Mulally's successor.""It's really close,"" the person said. Bloomberg earlier reported that Ford may make an announcement as early as May 1. Ford's annual meeting in Delaware is scheduled for May 8.A Ford spokeswoman declined to comment.""We do take succession planning very seriously,"" Ford spokeswoman Susan Krusel said. ""We do have succession plans in place for all of our key leadership positions, but for competitive reasons we do not discuss them."" Mulally is far from retiring and has long been exploring other high-profile positions to follow his Ford tenure. There was talk starting last year that he would take the top job at Microsoft, a position that eventually went to Satya Nadella. In 2012, he discussed a role in the Obama administration, but ultimately committed to two more years at Ford.Analysts said Fields will inherit a much stronger company than Mulally did, one with a highly profitable North American operation underpinned by the top-selling F-150 large pickup truck; growing share of China auto market, the world's largest; and a nascent recovery in Europe. Since Mulally took over as CEO, Ford's stock price has almost doubled.Execution will be the name of the game for Mark Fields, whereas recovery and transformation were the biggest challenges Mulally faced on Day One,"" Gabelli & Co analyst Brian Sponheimer said.""Fields is inheriting a company in much better shape than when Alan Mulally took over. It's a completely transformed company,"" Sponheimer added, referring to the company's shift to more global vehicle platforms to save money and speed product development. ""A lot of the headaches that Alan Mulally had to handle, including the recession in 2008 and 2009, are behind him."" Last December, Ford warned that the cost of launching new vehicles and a deteriorating Venezuelan economy would dent 2014 profits, sending its stock to its biggest one-day percentage drop in more than two years. This year, Ford is launching a record 23 global products, including a new version of the lucrative F-150.Those launches also will be a test for Fields, who has spent the last year focusing on improving quality.In January, Mulally ended speculation that he was in the running for the top job at software giant Microsoft and said he would remain at Ford at least this year. He emphasized during the Detroit auto show that month that he remained deeply engaged in Ford's day-to-day operations as well as setting long-term strategy. However, sources previously said it was unlikely Mulally would stay through 2014 and was looking for another high-profile job. Ford's board was frustrated by Mulally's courtship of Microsoft, the sources said.Mulally spurred a cultural change that helped the company take quicker action and make bolder bets, analysts, executives and other industry observers have said. His push helped the automaker avoid the federal bailouts required by General Motors Co and Chrysler Group LLC.One such risk is Ford's overhaul of its top-selling F-150 truck, unveiled in January. The truck's body is made almost entirely out of an aluminum alloy, which Ford bets will widen its lead over rivals General Motors Co and Chrysler Group LLC in the lucrative segment.In late 2012, Ford first announced that Mulally would remain at Ford until at least the end of 2014. This was part of a series of changes that included the promotion of Fields to COO.As COO, Fields runs Ford's weekly ""business plan review"" and manages day-to-day operations.An exit by Mulally in 2014 would mark the second high-profile changeover in the CEO position at an American automaker as Mary Barra took over at GM in January. She has since been dealing with the fallout from defective ignition switches linked to at least 13 deaths.   (Additional reporting by Rohit T.

174,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 22 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default Ratings  (IDRs) for Ford Motor Company (Ford) and its Ford Motor Credit Company LLC (Ford  Credit) captive finance subsidiary at 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook for both Ford  and Ford Credit has been revised to Positive from Stable. A full list of rating  actions taken on Ford and its subsidiaries follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS: FORD Ford's ratings continue to be supported by the automaker's strong liquidity  position, relatively low leverage, and improved North American profitability.  The revision of the Rating Outlook to Positive from Stable reflects Fitch's  expectation that over the intermediate term the company's European profitability  will continue to improve, automotive debt will continue to decline, and the  geographical diversification of the company's unit sales will continue to grow.  In addition, the Positive outlook reflects the significant improvement in the  funded status of the company's pension plans. Overall, Ford's increasingly  competitive product portfolio and lower cost structure have positioned the  company to withstand the significant cyclical and secular pressures faced by the  global auto industry. Incorporated into Ford's ratings is Fitch's expectation  that the company has sufficient financial flexibility to maintain an  investment-grade credit profile throughout a period of severe economic stress. Although Ford's financial position has improved significantly since the last  downturn, the company continues to face numerous risks. Chief among these is the  inherent cyclicality of the global auto market, which remains tied to global  economic conditions. In particular, although the Western European market appears  to have stabilized, the recovery remains tenuous, and Fitch does not expect a  return to pre-crisis levels in the near term. Geopolitical issues, such as the  recent events in Ukraine, also pose a risk for Ford and other global automakers.  The industry remains exposed to volatility in fuel prices and raw material  costs, which can affect vehicle demand and profitability. Technological change  and the need to meet increasingly stringent emissions and safety regulations  also pose risks, as does the highly competitive nature of the industry, with the  potential for manufacturers from developing markets such as China and India to  ultimately move into more mature markets. Although Ford will have to contend  with these risks over the long term, the company's improving product portfolio,  strong liquidity, declining debt levels, reduced pension obligations, and lower  cost structure have put it in a better position to effectively meet these  challenges while competing alongside strong competitors from Asia and Europe. Ford's ratings continue to be based, in part, on Fitch's forecast of the impact  that another severe downturn in the global automotive market would have on the  company's credit profile. With the company's operating leverage, working capital  profile, and capital expenditure needs, Fitch expects that Ford would burn a  substantial amount of cash in a downturn. However, Ford's automotive net cash  position of over $9 billion at year-end 2013, along with additional sources of  liquidity, would provide it with a sufficient flexibility to withstand a severe  decline in cash without falling into financial distress. Ford also has some  discretion in how it deploys its cash that could further relieve liquidity  pressures in a downturn, such as delaying certain capital expenditures, making  only mandatory pension contributions, and repaying debt only at maturity. Other  changes in Ford's post-recession business profile have also positioned it to  better withstand another downturn. The company's break-even sales level has  declined as a result of restructuring actions and an increased use of global  platforms, its product portfolio is more balanced and less reliant on large  truck sales, and its sales mix is more globally diversified. The geographical diversification of Ford's sales has been increasing, helping to  lessen the company's reliance on the mature North American and Western European  markets. Although the company will remain highly leveraged to the North American  market over the intermediate term, and it still has significant work ahead of it  to reach the level of diversification of some of its global peers, Ford has made  significant inroads into important developing markets, particularly China. In  China, Ford's Focus is one of the top selling vehicles in the country, while the  company's line-up of small and midsize sport utility vehicles (SUVs) has given  it a strong product offering in a growing segment. Ford's market share in China  grew to 4.1% in 2013, up from 3.2% in 2012. In the first quarter of 2014, Ford's  sales in China rose 45%. Although Ford's operations in China are conducted  through unconsolidated joint ventures, the country remains a key component of  the company's long-term growth strategy, and dividends from the joint ventures  will be an increasingly important source of cash going forward. The European market continues to be challenging, but economic conditions appear  to be stabilizing, industry sales are rising and Ford's performance in the  region is getting stronger. Through March 2014, Ford's vehicles sales in the 20  European markets that it tracks have risen on a year-over-year basis in each of  the last 10 months. In the first quarter of 2014, Ford's European sales were up  11% versus the first quarter of 2013, and its market share in the region was up  30 basis points to 8%. At the same time, Ford's customer mix has improved  somewhat, with the percentage of sales to daily rental car fleets and dealer  registrations declining by 100 basis points to 27%. Ford's reorganization  remains on-track, with two smaller U.K. factories closed in mid-2013 and the  Genk, Belgium facility still targeted for closure in late 2014. After posting a  pre-tax loss of ($1.6) billion in the region in 2013, Fitch expects the  combination of growing sales and an improving cost structure to result in a  meaningfully better financial performance in Europe over the near term,  including the potential to generate a positive pre-tax profit in the region in  2015, although the economic recovery in the region remains somewhat fragile. In North America, Ford is in the midst of a heavy product roll-out in 2014 that  is likely to result in lower wholesale deliveries and an increase in structural  costs. The 16 new or heavily refreshed vehicles slated to begin production in  the latter half of 2014 include the new F-150, the Transit full-size van and the  new Mustang. Although, North American pre-tax profit will likely be down in 2014  as a result of the launches, the refreshed vehicle line-up should provide a  tailwind for the company heading into 2015. The aluminum-intensive F-150 is the  most notable new vehicle, as the F-150 is both Ford's highest-selling vehicle in  North America and among its most profitable. As a result, the significant  changes to the vehicle present some risk, both in terms of production roll-out  and customer acceptance. Notably, however, Ford has stated that the new F-150  will contribute to the company meeting its U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy  targets, a meaningful change from prior versions of the truck, which worked  against the company meeting the target. This will provide the company with a  near-term competitive advantage, as it will not need to offset F-150 sales with  increased sales of smaller cars. It may also help support higher pricing in the  highly competitive full-size pickup segment. Ford's liquidity position remains strong, with automotive cash and marketable  securities at year end 2013 totaling $25 billion. Including nearly $11 billion  of primary revolver availability, total liquidity exceeded debt by nearly $20  billion. At the same time, Ford's leverage remains low for its rating category.  EBITDA leverage (debt/Fitch-calculated EBITDA) rose to 1.9x at year-end 2013  from 1.6x at year-end 2012, but funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage  declined to 1.5x from 1.6x over the same period as FFO grew. Ford ended 2013  with about $16 billion in debt, up from $14 billion at year-end 2012, while  EBITDA (as calculated by Fitch) declined somewhat to $8.5 billion from $8.8  billion. The Fitch-calculated EBITDA margin declined to 6.1% in 2013 from 7% in  2012. Over the intermediate term, Fitch expects Ford's leverage to decline as  the company works toward its $10 billion mid-decade automotive debt target.  Fitch also expects Ford's margins to improve as it moves past the heavy launch  activity and restructuring in 2014. Automotive free cash flow (as calculated by Fitch) is likely to be pressured and  could be negative in 2014 despite a significant decline in pension  contributions, as Ford increased its dividend by 25% in the first quarter and  capital spending is forecast to be higher as well. Ford's capital spending  forecast is roughly $7.5 billion in 2014, up from $6.6 billion in 2013, while  dividends are likely to total about $2 billion versus $1.6 billion in 2013.  Operating cash flow is likely to be lower than the 2013 level as well, as  structural costs increase to support the company's heavy launch activity during  the year, including the 16 new or refreshed vehicles in North America. Although  free cash flow could be negative in 2014, Fitch expects Ford's overall liquidity  balance to remain strong, even as the company reduces debt by over $1 billion,  mostly by making amortization payments on outstanding loans. After 2014, Fitch  expects Ford's free cash flow will improve as the items constraining it in 2014  abate, and the company benefits from new model introductions and the wind-down  of its restructuring in Europe. The funded status of Ford's pension plans has improved significantly over the  past several years. As of year-end 2013, Ford's global pension plans (including  certain unfunded non-U.S. plans) were underfunded by $9 billion, an improvement  of $9.7 billion from the funded status at year-end 2012. Most of the improvement  was in the U.S., where the company's plans were underfunded by only $2 billion  at year-end 2013. On a percentage basis, Ford's U.S. plans were over 95% funded,  a significant reversal from the steep underfunding seen immediately after the  recession.  Ford contributed $5.4 billion to its global pension plans in 2013, including  $3.4 billion in discretionary contributions to its U.S. plans. In 2014, Ford  plans to contribute $1.9 billion to its global funded and unfunded pension  plans, most of which will be required contributions to non-U.S. plans, as the  company is not likely to have any required U.S. contributions. Ford has noted  that it intends to contribute between $1 billion and $2 billion annually to its  global funded plans in 2015 and 2016, which will allow the company to fully fund  and de-risk its funded plans. Once fully funded and de-risked, the company has  noted that contributions will likely run in a range of only $500 million to $700  million per year to cover service costs.  KEY RATING DRIVERS: FORD CREDIT The rating affirmation of Ford Credit and its affiliates reflect the direct  linkage to Ford's ratings. Fitch considers Ford Credit to be a 'core' subsidiary  of Ford due to its importance to Ford, as demonstrated by the high percentage of  Ford vehicles sales financed by Ford Credit, and the strong operational and  financial linkages between the two companies. The ratings also reflect Ford  Credit's improving credit profile, consistent operating performance, peer  superior asset quality, and adequate liquidity and risk adjusted capitalization. Ford Credit's managed portfolio increased 13% to $103.4 billion in 2013 from  $91.7 billion in 2012 (the fastest pace since 2008) largely driven by increase  in net operating leases and non-consumer finance receivables, which grew 35%  year over year. Lease portfolio measured $18.3billion at year-end 2013, but is  still well below the pre-crisis peak of $29.7 billion in 2007. Fitch notes that  leasing is a relatively riskier strategy as it further exposes the company to  residual value risk, particularly when used car values are expected to weaken.  However, Fitch believes that Ford Credit has a good track record in managing its  residual value exposure and expects the company to be prudent in setting  residual values on new lease originations. Fitch also believes that Ford's  improved quality and line-up of fuel efficient vehicles should generate stronger  resale values relative to historical levels. Operating performance slightly improved in 2013 as favorable factors such as  higher financing volume were offset by higher loss provision expense and lower  residual value gains. Fitch expects Ford Credit will generate strong  profitability in 2014 but does not expect material improvement over 2013, as  increased volume from healthy U.S. auto sales will likely be offset by tighter  pricing/margins due to increased competition, higher provision expense from  expected credit normalization, higher borrowing costs as the company shifts to a  more unsecured funding mix, and lower residual value gains. Asset quality continued to outperform its peers with Ford Credit reporting the  second lowest level of losses in its history. Fitch expects asset quality will  continue to normalize given portfolio seasoning and softening in used car  values. Ford Credit's global loss to receivable ratio measured 0.18% in 2013, up  2 basis points from 0.16% in 2012, and compares favorably to peers. Allowance  for loan losses has been prudently managed and measured 0.37% in 2013, offering  a solid coverage over net losses. Managed leverage, calculated by the company, measured 8.5x in 2013, up slightly  from 8.3x in 2012, but firmly in-line with management's target range of 8.0x -  9.0x. Fitch believes Ford Credit's relatively higher leverage is reflective of  its higher quality loan/lease portfolio, which has shown superior credit  performance relative to its captive peers. Funding and liquidity continues to  improve as the company is reducing its reliance on secured funding sources,  which should offer greater funding flexibility in times of stress and result in  larger pool of unencumbered assets benefiting unsecured creditors. Short-term debt, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of total debt,  has been increasing post-crisis. Fitch recognizes the motivation to fund short  term, as these sources are often less costly; however, overreliance on  short-term funding can be very problematic during times of market duress, as was  proven in the recent financial crisis. Currently, short-term debt is at a  reasonable level of Ford Credit's total debt base (15.2% in 2013), especially  considering the short-dated assets such as the commercial floorplan receivables  on the balance sheet. However, a material increase in short-term funding would  be viewed negatively by Fitch. RATING SENSITIVITIES: FORD Positive: Further developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  positive rating action include: --Continued growth in the company's margins and free cash flow; --Continued progress toward the company's $10 billion mid-decade debt target; --Further improvement in the funded status of the company's pension plans; --Additional geographical diversification in the company's revenue stream,  especially a further increase in Chinese sales; --Continued performance toward meeting the company's mid-decade European  profitability target; --The successful roll-out of the company's 23 new or heavily refreshed global  vehicles, including 16 in North America. Negative: Further developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --A very severe downturn in the global auto market leads to a significant  weakening of Ford's liquidity position; --An increase in long-term debt to finance an acquisition or fund  shareholder-friendly activities; --Problems with operational execution or declining market share trends. RATING SENSITIVITIES: FORD CREDIT Ford Credit's ratings will move in tandem with its parent. Any change in its  strategic importance or a change in Fitch's view on whether Ford Credit remains  core could change this rating linkage with its parent. A material increase in  leverage, an inability to access funding for an extended period of time, and/or  significant deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying loan and lease  portfolio, could become restraining factors on the parent's ratings.

175,"  (Adds forecast by Edmunds)DETROIT, April 24 U.S. auto sales will rise 8.5 percent in April from a year ago as spring weather entices consumers to look at new products, industry research firms J.D. Power and LMC Automotive said on Thursday.The annualized sales rate for April was forecast at 16.1 million vehicles, the firms said, with total sales at 1.395 million vehicles. Edmunds.com, another research firm, said on Thursday that April auto sales would rise 9.1 percent to 1.4 million vehicles, for an annualized selling rate of 16.2 million vehicles.Edmunds said April sales for General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co would each show a rise of about 5 percent while three automakers would have double-digit gains: Nissan Motor Co  at 18 percent, Toyota Motor Corp   at 14 percent, and Chrysler Group, a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, at 12 percent. ""Auto sales are hitting their stride as the spring selling season begins, and the pace has returned to the level expected at this stage of the recovery,"" said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president of forecasting at LMC Automotive. ""Fueling the growth further as the year progresses is a very robust level of new-model activity, with 63 new or redesigned models expected to hit showrooms, a 60 percent increase from last year."" March U.S. auto sales finished at an annualized selling rate of 16.4 million vehicles, and last April's annualized selling rate was 15.2 million vehicles.The firms maintained forecasts of full-year 2014 U.S. auto sales at 16.1 million vehicles, up from 15.6 million vehicles in 2013.

176,"  * Q1 net profit 1.9 trln won vs 2.19 trln won analyst view* Profit almost flat on year; lowest in five quarters* Lacklustre U.S. performance offsets China, Korea sales   (Recasts; adds CFO, analyst comments, closing share price)By Hyunjoo JinSEOUL, April 24 South Korea's Hyundai Motor  has launched a contingency plan to prepare for further appreciation in the local currency, which pushed January-March profit to the lowest in five quarters.Hyundai, the world's fifth-biggest automaker when combined with affiliate Kia Motors Corp, has seen overseas earnings shrink when converted into a won hovering near a six-year high against the U.S. dollar.Price competitiveness has also suffered, as a firmer won makes Korea-made exports more expensive for overseas buyers. The revenue impact of a 1.5 percent first-quarter rise in the won was exacerbated by buying incentives in the United States.Net profit was 1.93 trillion won ($1.86 billion) in January-March, marginally less than a year prior when Hyundai set aside cash to cover a product recall. The result was also lower than the 2.19 trillion won estimate of 13 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""A contingency plan is under way to prepare for further won strength, which we expect to persist in the second quarter,"" said Chief Financial Officer Lee Won-hee in a conference call after Hyundai released earnings on Thursday.The contingency plan includes cutting vehicle development costs, Lee said, without elaborating.Shares of Hyundai closed down 1.2 percent after the results, compared with a 0.1 percent decline in the wider market.""Management tried to give a positive signal to investors, but Hyundai faces a bumpy road ahead. No one can predict how the currency will move, and competition is getting tougher,"" said E*Trade Korea auto analyst Kang Sang-min. ""It also remains to be seen how well new models will be received by U.S. customers,"" Kang said.Hyundai has had a turbulent time in the United States where a product recall last year was followed by lacklustre sales and a management shake-up. The automaker has also had fewer new models in its product line-up in recent years compared with rivals.Ahead of new model launches, Hyundai increased buying incentives to clear its inventory, Lee said, which contributed to a 3 percent decline in first-quarter U.S. sales.""We expect the U.S. launches of the new Genesis (in April) and Sonata (in June) to help improve our sales and operating margin from the second quarter,"" he said. In China, the world's biggest auto market, Hyundai has been expanding sales and this month tasked its new local chief with expediting the construction of a fourth factory.Adding capacity at its third Chinese plant helped raise sales in the country by 9 percent in the first quarter, though that was slower than the growth rates of Japan's Toyota Motor Corp and the U.S.'s Ford Motor Co.At home in Korea, sales climbed 5 percent with the help of the luxury, higher-margin Genesis - revamped late in 2013 - as well as a recovery in production following a labour dispute a year earlier.Hyundai will begin annual wage talks as early as May with the labour union in Korea, where the automaker builds nearly 40 percent of the vehicles it sells globally.Domestic sales could get a lift in the second quarter from the introduction late last month of a Sonata redesigned for the first time in five years.Hyundai's bread-and-butter model, however, is pitted against imports such as Volkswagen AG's Passat and Toyota's Camry which are benefiting from free-trade deals.($1 = 1037.6000 Korean Won)   (Editing by Christopher Cushing)",2014-04-24,F,"Thu Apr 24, 2014 | 6:40am EDT",UPDATE 2-Hyundai Motor launches contingency plan as stronger won knocks Q1 profit,http://www.reuters.com//article/hyundai-motor-results-q-idUSL3N0N826D20140424?type=companyNews

The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond's yield fell to 3.42 percent, lowest since last June.Russia warned Kiev on Friday that it would face justice after Ukrainian forces killed up to five pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine on Thursday.Standard & Poor's downgraded Russia's credit rating to triple-B-minus, one level above junk. That forced Russia's central bank to raise interest rates by 50 basis points to 7.5 percent to try to head off inflation from a weakened currency.""(The market's) a little bit tired, but then you throw in all this stuff - it's Friday, you have the weekend coming, you have the whole Russia and Ukraine thing, Putin is pounding the table, so naturally you get this risk-off mentality,"" said Ken Polcari, a director at O'Neil Securities in New York.

183,"   By Ben Klayman and Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co posted a lower-than-expected first-quarter profit on Friday as the No. 2 U.S. automaker reported $400 million in higher warranty costs in North America, sending shares down more than 3 percent.Across the auto industry, safety recalls and warranty costs have received increasing attention as cars have become more complex and loaded with technology, Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said.""Everybody is generally reacting, and certainly we do, as soon as we find a problem,"" he told reporters at the company's suburban Detroit headquarters. ""And you're seeing that across the business. It's not any particular company.""While Ford adjusts its warranty reserves every quarter, the total was larger in the first quarter because the company has dealt with more field service actions such as recalls and addressing customer complaints over the last two years, Shanks said.Conspicuous safety defects also demand that automakers respond or risk large federal fines and hefty legal payouts, which General Motors Co now faces because of its recall of faulty ignition switches linked to at least 13 deaths. The GM recall serves as reminder to rivals, Stifel analyst James Albertine said.""Any (automaker) that is not taking advantage of the opportunity GM has given them to clean the proverbial recall house is missing the boat,"" he said.In addition to the higher warranty costs, Ford's incentives in North America also rose in the first quarter due to an aging lineup of vehicles, something Ford is addressing with the launch of 16 new models in the region this year. Newer vehicles typically sell with no incentives or reduced ones.""The company has a lot of new products coming online this year,"" said Fitch Ratings analyst Stephen Brown, who expects earnings to improve in the second half because of the new model rollouts. ""They haven't seen the benefits (of the new vehicles) on dealer lots yet.""Analysts have worried that U.S. industry incentives may rise as sales growth slows. Research firm TrueCar.com said industry average incentive spending per vehicle in April jumped almost 9 percent to about $2,750.Despite the rising incentives, Ford affirmed its forecast for pretax profit for 2014, a year in which it is launching a record 23 new vehicles globally. It also said it is amending and extending its revolving credit facility. Shanks said the underlying business remains strong.""The run rate is very healthy and we feel that we're moving forward very nicely in terms of what we expect for the year and setting us up for stronger growth and stronger profitability in 2015 and beyond,"" he said.Also on Friday, Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally, 68, said on a conference call that there was no change in his plans to remain at the company through the end of the year. Earlier this week, a source said that Ford will soon name Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields as Mulally's successor.Net income fell 39 percent to $989 million, or 24 cents a share, from $1.61 billion, or 40 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.The quarter included the $400 million in additional costs for warranty reserves in North America for vehicles from as early as the 2001 model year, and $100 million in costs related to higher freight and other items due to the harsh winter in North America. It also included previously disclosed costs of $400 million, mostly due to the currency devaluation in Venezuela. All three items totaled 17 cents a share. Excluding one-time items for European restructuring, Ford earned 25 cents a share, 6 cents below analysts' estimates in a poll by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The warranty reserves totaled 6 cents a share while weather costs accounted for another 2 cents.Revenue was up slightly at $35.9 billion, above the $34.06 billion analysts had expected.EUROPEAN LOSS NARROWS Ford, which still expects a pretax profit this year in the range of $7 billion to $8 billion, said its credit facility is expected to grow to about $12 billion, from $10.7 billion after its completion at the end of the month. It forecast operations in South America will be weaker than previously forecast for the year, while Asia Pacific's profit will be higher than last year.Shanks said various global launches, including its redesign for the highly profitable F-150 full-size pickup truck, remain on track. Net pricing in the quarter was up only $175 million as incentives increased $471 million over last year. Most of those higher incentives were offered in North America, where net overall pricing actually fell.The North American operating profit fell by more than a third to $1.5 billion. RBC Capital markets analyst Joseph Spak said that was below Wall Street's expected consensus of $2.2 billion and the company's profit margin in the region was weaker than expected.The North American operating margin fell to 7.3 percent from 11.1 percent last year as Shanks said the warranty and weather-related costs took a bite of 2.5 percentage points. However, Ford affirmed its outlook for a full-year margin in the region of 8 to 9 percent.Overseas, business was more positive as demand continued to increase in China, the world's largest auto market, and the company's losses in Europe narrowed and were lower than expected according to analysts.In China, Ford said its market share hit a record 4.5 percent, up from 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter. The profit in Asia Pacific rose to $291 million from a year-ago loss of $28 million.The company's loss in Europe, which has been a drag on Ford profit for several years, was $194 million, down from $425 million a year ago.The loss in South America, however, deteriorated to $510 million from a loss of $218 million last year due to the currency devaluation in Venezuela and Argentina.Ford shares were down 3.4 percent at $15.77 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.(Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Sofina Mirza-Reid; and Matthew Lewis)",2014-04-25,F,"Fri Apr 25, 2014 | 2:37pm EDT","Ford profit driven down by North America, warranty costs",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-ford-motor-results-idUSBREA3O0YW20140425?type=companyNews

190,"   By Allison Martell and Cameron French | TORONTO  TORONTO Toronto Mayor Rob Ford flew to the United States in a private plane on Thursday, a TV network said, a day after he said he would take a leave of absence from his job and his re-election campaign to seek treatment for an alcohol problem.Global News reported that it had confirmed Chicago as Ford's destination but did not cite any sources. It said it was unclear whether he was staying in Chicago or if he was receiving help.Ford's decision to take a leave of absence followed months of denials that he has a substance abuse problem and nearly a year after media reports surfaced that he appeared in a video smoking crack cocaine.His departure followed a Globe and Mail report on Wednesday that it had seen a video shot last week that showed Ford using what appeared to be drugs.On Thursday morning, TV cameras showed Ford, 44, leaving his house and getting into a car driven by another person. Earlier, a large suitcase was seen being taken out of the house and being put into a separate car.Ford did not talk to reporters, but late on Wednesday he released a statement admitting that he has a problem with alcohol and saying that he would seek help to deal with it immediately. The statement did not specify where he planned to go or how long he'd be away.Ford's brother, Doug Ford, a city councilor and manager of the mayor's re-election campaign, choked back tears on Thursday as he told reporters he had encouraged the mayor to take time off.""As an older brother, I'm relieved that Rob has faced his problems and has decided to seek professional help,"" he said. Doug Ford often speaks for the mayor and has been his most ardent defender, often berating reporters who ask about his brother's personal problems.Those problems have become increasingly public in the wake of Ford's admission in November that he had smoked crack while in a ""drunken stupor"".Since then, several videos have emerged showing the mayor ranting and slurring his words. Also, Toronto police said they had started investigating Ford after his name popped up in a drug probe. In its report on the latest video, the Globe and Mail published a screen grab on its front page showing Ford holding a small pipe.Separately on Wednesday, the Toronto Sun reported on a recording it had obtained of Ford ranting and swearing at a suburban Toronto bar on Monday. In it, he makes lewd remarks about rival mayoral candidate Karen Stintz, and also makes threats and utters racial slurs.In the statement announcing his leave of absence, Ford did not address allegations of drug use or either of the recordings.Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly told a news conference on Thursday that he was assuming Ford's duties until the mayor returns.""The events that have brought us together this morning can be best described as a personal tragedy and should not be seen as a crisis of government,"" Kelly said. ""The actions of the mayor are inexcusable. It's fundamental that we as members of council respect each other and the people we represent.""Kelly had already been carrying out many of the duties normally conducted by the mayor following the city council's decision in November to strip Ford of much of his power.City Manager Joe Penachetti confirmed that Ford's council seat would become vacant if he misses three monthly council meetings - in other words, if he is not back by the July meeting - unless the council gives him permission to stay away.MAYORAL RACE Ford's absence comes in the midst of his campaign to be returned to office in October's municipal election. He has bet that his core of support in the city's suburbs will give him enough votes to top main rivals Olivia Chow and John Tory. First elected mayor in 2010, Ford has maintained a cost-cutting ""respect the taxpayer"" mantra that has resonated with many suburban voters.He often paints himself as a champion of the suburbs against downtown ""elites"", and in a departure from an otherwise right-leaning agenda, has vowed to build subways instead of lower-cost light-rail transit.Lorne Bozinoff, president of Forum Research, said that while Ford's popularity has suffered from a year's worth of bad publicity, his loyal core supporters mean he should not be counted out of the race, even as the latest news is sure to alienate some voters.""The timing's better now than after Labor day, which would be serious campaign time. And we've got the whole summer, when people forget things. I think the key thing is, is he going to sound contrite,"" Bozinoff said.Recent polls have shown Ford in second place in popular support behind Chow despite last year's revelations about crack, which made headlines globally and drew ridicule from U.S. late-night talk show hosts.John Wright of pollster Ipsos, however, said it will be tough for Ford to build on numbers that were already not good enough to win.""If anything, it opens a 30-day window for John Tory to possibly tilt towards the 'protecting taxpayers money' mantra that the mayor has held,"" said Wright.""A month in rehab may also change Rob Ford too. Let's not assume that he will come out of 30 days and want to or be able to get back on the horse.""(Editing by Jeffrey Hodgson, Peter Galloway and Ken Wills)",2014-05-01,F,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 6:08pm EDT",Toronto Mayor Ford takes leave to deal with alcohol problem,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-toronto-mayor-idUSBREA4001I20140501?type=companyNews

Hybrid vehicles, which typically use both a traditional internal combustion engine and an electric motor, also sold well.Chrysler Canada said on Thursday that its total vehicle sales climbed 6 percent in April, as a surge truck sales more than offset slumping car purchases, and it claimed the country's spot for top seller in 2014.But rival Ford's Canadian unit took the lead in monthly sales, breaking records for its Escape and Explorer models and several hybrid vehicles.Ford said it sold 27,342 vehicles in April, a 2 percent decline from a year ago, as it bucked the industry trend with declining truck sales.

Toyota Canada sold 20,663 vehicles, a 2.9 percent increase, to take fourth place on the back of strong truck sale growth.Among luxury brands, Infiniti sales jumped almost 40 percent, Land Rover gained more than 26 percent, and Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar and Porsche all grew around 15 percent.The U.S. auto industry rebounded sharply in April from a bitter and extended winter, with four of the top six automakers reporting year-over-year gains in sales on Thursday.Chrysler Group LLC, Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co all topped analysts' expectations with double-digit sales increases.

195,"   By Ben Klayman | DEARBORN, Michigan  DEARBORN, Michigan Ford Motor Co on Thursday made official what investors and analysts had been waiting for - Chief Executive Alan Mulally this summer will pass the baton of leadership to Chief Operating Officer Mark Fields, six months earlier than expected.The 68-year-old Mulally is credited with transforming the No. 2 U.S. automaker from a money-loser to a company that expects to realize a pretax profit of up to $8 billion this year after joining in 2006 from Boeing Co.Mulally, who was in the running for the top job at Microsoft Corp late last year, did not say what was next for him. Ford's CEO change takes effect on July 1.The ascension of 53-year-old Fields as the next CEO, which the company's board approved on Wednesday, was expected, but the timing had been unclear.  Mulally said the transition was moved up from year-end because he felt the team and Fields were ready.Fields, who promised to hew to his predecessor's strategy, said his current COO position would not be filled when the CEO change occurs, adding in a later interview that the management team structure without that position was ""appropriate.""When asked whether he considered promoting Joe Hinrichs, president of the Americas and an executive perceived by many in the auto industry as a rising star, Fields told Reuters that Hinrichs had a ""really big job now running North America. He's very talented and he's got a bright future.""Mulally said in a later interview that he had no concerns that Hinrichs would leave as he is intimately involved in setting the company's strategy.Fields also said he would stay in touch with Mulally even though he will leave the company board. Fields pointed out that Mulally remains a Ford shareholder. Asked why he was not remaining on Ford's board, Mulally said it was the right time for him to leave and turn it over to the next team. WASH, RINSE, REPEAT Analysts said Fields will inherit a much stronger company than Mulally did, one with a highly profitable North American operation underpinned by the top-selling F-150 large pickup truck. Ford also has a growing share of the China auto market, the world's largest, and is seeing a nascent recovery in Europe.Wall Street does not expect big changes given Fields has been a major architect of the turnaround plan under Mulally.""You know the plan, you know how to work the plan,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said. ""Mark (Fields) calls it 'wash, rinse and repeat.'"" The biggest challenge awaiting the new CEO is the launch this autumn of a redesigned, more aluminum-intensive version of the F-150, a key profit generator for the company, analysts said. UBS analyst Colin Langan called the new truck ""a potential game changer in the industry.""Ford is introducing a company-record 23 new vehicles this year, most of them in North America. Those launches also will be a test for Fields, who has spent the last year focusing on improving quality.MULALLY'S NEXT MOVE? Fields said on Thursday that he does not plan changes to the company's leadership team, and said his primary focus will be to continue and accelerate progress on the ""One Ford"" plan established by Mulally. That strategy calls for sharing of engineering and design of vehicles around the globe to improve quality and cut costs. ""It's a story of continuity,"" Fields told a roomful of more than 400 employees and reporters at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.Mulally is expected to seek another high-profile job. In 2012, he discussed a role in the Obama administration, but ultimately committed to two more years at Ford.Bill Ford, great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, said he would make sure the automaker does not revert to a corporate culture he once described as having ""more intrigue than czarist Russia.""Bill Ford, who preceded Mulally as chief executive and is the company's executive chairman, said the automaker looked at outside candidates to replace Mulally, but quickly decided Fields was the best option.Mulally said he has not decided on his plans after July 1 as he was focused on ensuring a smooth transition but he was looking forward to the next opportunity and was confident in Fields as his successor.

Asked why he was not remaining on Ford's board, Mulally said it was the right time for him to leave and turn it over to the next team.WASH, RINSE, REPEAT  Analysts said Fields will inherit a much stronger company than Mulally did, one with a highly profitable North American operation underpinned by the top-selling F-150 large pickup truck. Ford also has a growing share of the China auto market, the world's largest, and is seeing a nascent recovery in Europe.Wall Street does not expect big changes given Fields has been a major architect of the turnaround plan under Mulally.""You know the plan, you know how to work the plan,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said. ""Mark (Fields) calls it 'wash, rinse and repeat.'""The biggest challenge awaiting the new CEO is the launch this autumn of a redesigned, more aluminum-intensive version of the F-150, a key profit generator for the company, analysts said. UBS analyst Colin Langan called the new truck ""a potential game changer in the industry.""Ford is introducing a company-record 23 new vehicles this year, most of them in North America. Those launches also will be a test for Fields, who has spent the last year focusing on improving quality. MULALLY'S NEXT MOVE? Fields said on Thursday that he does not plan changes to the company's leadership team, and said his primary focus will be to continue and accelerate progress on the ""One Ford"" plan established by Mulally. That strategy calls for sharing of engineering and design of vehicles around the globe to improve quality and cut costs.""It's a story of continuity,"" Fields told a roomful of more than 400 employees and reporters at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.Mulally is expected to seek another high-profile job. In 2012, he discussed a role in the Obama administration, but ultimately committed to two more years at Ford.Bill Ford, great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford, said he would make sure the automaker does not revert to a corporate culture he once described as having ""more intrigue than czarist Russia.""Bill Ford, who preceded Mulally as chief executive and is the company's executive chairman, said the automaker looked at outside candidates to replace Mulally, but quickly decided Fields was the best option.Mulally said he has not decided on his plans after July 1 as he was focused on ensuring a smooth transition but he was looking forward to the next opportunity and was confident in Fields as his successor. ""I have nothing left to teach him,"" he  said.Ford shares were down 1 percent at $15.99 on Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

203,"  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) announced on Wednesday a stock repurchase program of about $1.8 billion that it said will offset potential share dilution and positions the company to reduce its automotive debt by $883 million.The announcement boosted Ford stock about 0.7 percent to $15.57 per share after the New York Stock Exchange closed.Ford at the end of the first quarter had automotive debt of about $15.7 billion and has said that it plans to reduce that debt to about $10 billion by mid-decade.Up to 116 million shares will be repurchased.

206,"  SHANGHAI May 8 Ford Motor Co and its Chinese joint ventures sold 96,829 vehicles in China in April, up 29 percent from a year earlier, the U.S. automaker said on Thursday.That follows a 28 percent year-on-year rise in March and a 67 percent increase in February.The company's sales in the first four months of the year came to 368,150 cars, up 41 percent from the same period a year earlier. Ford's China sales have been bolstered by continued strong demand for its Ford Focus model, the best-selling car in the country last year, and sales of the Ford Mondeo nameplate increased more than fivefold in April.

207,"  BEIJING May 10 China's vehicle sales increased 8.8 percent year-on-year in April, an industry association said on Friday, as foreign automakers, including Ford Motor Co. , continue to cash in on local demand, despite the country's slowing economy.China sold 2 million vehicles in the month in total, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported, led by an 11.6 percent year-on-year increase in cars to 1.6 million.Ford said this week that sales at its Chinese joint ventures increased 29 percent in April, following a 28 percent year-on-year rise in March, and a 67 percent increase in February. Japan's Toyota Motor Corp also said this week that sales by its two local joint-venture partners increased 12.4 percent in April.

But growth for the period was 4.1 percentage points lower than the first four months of last year.CAAM has forecast the market will grow 8-10 percent this year, slowing from last year's 13.9 percent pace.

208,"  * Hyundai to launch van with Turkey's Karsan in 2015-source* Renault already sees tougher van market* VW, Ford among manufacturers shifting to lower-cost sitesBy Laurence Frost and Gilles GuillaumePARIS, May 15 Hyundai is preparing to enter the European commercial van market with a Turkish-built vehicle, a source said, adding to signs that Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen could lose their grip on a lucrative part of the auto industry.The South Korean automaker will debut a large van at September's Hanover truck show and begin production with Turkish partner Karsan next year, a person familiar with the plan told Reuters. Hyundai declined to comment.The move follows Volkswagen's decision to build a second light commercial vehicle (LCV) in a lower-wage country, shifting its Crafter van to Poland from Germany.Both new programmes underscore toughening competition in the van market, which has already seen margins squeezed by heavy discounting but remains more profitable than mass-market cars.That poses a particular risk to French market leaders Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroen, which could now see models built in costlier western European plants, such as Peugeot's Boxer, Citroen's Jumper and the Renault Master, undercut by vans made in lower-cost countries.""Light commercial vehicles are the category where competition is really much more fierce than before,"" Renault sales chief Jerome Stoll told analysts on a recent call.While LCVs account for only about 10 percent of all European vehicle sales, they make a significantly larger contribution to profit.But discounting is intense despite recovering demand, which saw European van sales rise 9.9 percent in the first quarter.Few manufacturers break down their profitability by vehicle type. Analysts say the estimated margins on the French groups' vans were about twice the 3-4 percent made on cars in better years preceding the 2008 financial crisis. ""If LCVs were a 6-8 percent margin business in the past, this may deteriorate for some as the cost spread between manufacturers widens,"" said Erich Hauser, an analyst at brokerage ISI Group in London.""VW would have been quite happy building its vans in Germany for ever, so clearly something has changed in this market.""Resisting the exodus from western Europe, the French have kept most production at home or in some cases even repatriated vans to fill gaps left by axed or offshored car programmes.Vans replaced cars at Renault's Maubeuge plant more than 20 years ago. The company is now moving its Trafic van from Spain to another northern French site as its ageing Espace and Laguna car models wind down.Renault's budget Dacia brand also builds vans in Morocco and Romania, accounting for a modest 7 percent of regional sales.Peugeot is introducing new vans to its Sevelnord factory in partnership with Toyota to replace discontinued people-carriers previously built with Fiat. MARKET SHARE While the two French groups still lead European registrations, their combined market share fell to 36.7 percent last year from 39.4 percent in 2010, IHS Automotive data shows.VW's share rose to 13.2 percent from 10.6 over the same three years. Ford, which halted UK production of Transit vans in 2012-13 to concentrate output in Turkey, advanced almost one point to reach 11.6 percent of the European market.Backed by its lower-cost production, the U.S. automaker is gaining ground with attractive discount offers on even its newest van models, ISI's Hauser said.EurotaxGlass's, a leading market data provider, has charted a surge in price-cutting moves such as pre-registrations - where dealers receive new vehicles to sell as used. Such margin-crushing van sales have increased 15-20 percent by volume since 2008 even as the overall market shrank by a quarter, technical director Dean Bowkett said.""There are significant levels of discounting going on even in commercial vehicles, which is unusual,"" he said.""Historically it's always been cars that have been laden with pre-regs - but we're now seeing it with commercial vehicles as well.""Hyundai has yet to finalise pricing and other launch details for its new vehicle, according to the source, who described the production deal with Karsan as ""a toe in the water"".Karsan, based in Turkey's industrially developed Bursa province, already builds Hyundai light trucks for the local market as well as vehicles for other manufacturers' brands.VW assembles its smaller existing Caddy van in Poznan, Poland, and is investing 3.4 billion zlotys ($1.1 billion) in a nearby plant to begin making Crafters in 2016, ending joint production with Daimler in Germany.Stephane Chesnel, Peugeot's head of leasing to major fleet clients, said the prospect of a second Polish-built VW van was unlikely to alter the French group's immediate plans.""That is Volkswagen's choice, but we are not changing our production as things stand today,"" Chesnel said in an interview.Beyond the rebounding sales volumes, however, Chesnel sees signs that recession and austerity may have shaped demand in ways that prevent a return to pre-crisis margins.""Clients used to order vans with more capacity than they needed,"" he said. ""Now they look closely at their requirement and try to reduce the volume of the vehicles they buy.""($1 = 3.0557 Polish Zlotys)   (Editing by Mark John and Mark Potter)",2014-05-15,F,"Thu May 15, 2014 | 7:31am EDT","Hyundai van plan signals rougher ride for Peugeot, Renault",http://www.reuters.com//article/europe-vans-idUSL6N0NY3DA20140515?type=companyNews
209,"  (Adds comments from bankers, details on strategy)By Guillermo Parra-BernalSAO PAULO May 16 Brazilian investment bank Bradesco BBI SA extended its push into the U.S. debt market on Friday by clinching a double role as joint-lead manager and bookrunner of a $1.04 billion sale of asset-backed securities by Ford Motor Co's finance unit.Bradesco BBI, the wholesale and investment banking unit of Brazil's Banco Bradesco SA, was one of four banks advising Ford Motor Credit Co on the sale of securities. The notes are backed by a revolving pool of prime retail sales contracts secured by new and used vehicles originated in the United States by Ford Credit.The transaction, which was initially $750 million, was the first in which a Brazilian investment bank acted as a bookrunner and lead manager for a sale of an ABS in the world's largest bond market. Bradesco advised Ford Credit in similar deals over the past three years.The deal is the result of heavy investment by Bradesco and other Brazilian banks to hone their ability to offer and place securities to investors around the world. Bradesco has topped local and global bond underwriting league tables for the past two years, while Itaú BBA SA and Grupo BTG Pactual SA took the biggest slice of investment banking fees in Brazil in the same period. ""This deal is key to our strategy, which is not only developing the ability to originate a product but also being able to place it to any type of investor around the world,"" said Renato Ejnisman, managing director of Bradesco BBI's investment banking unit. ""Don't be surprised if in a few years Brazilian banks are capable of handling a global issue on their own.""The bank is in talks with several U.S. and European companies for similar deals, Ejnisman said, without elaborating. SPREADS The sale comes as spreads, or how much extra yield an issuer has to pay relative to U.S. benchmark rates, for some asset-backed securities tightened in April. Yields for U.S. transport sector ABS deals narrowed more than in other segments, according to Barclays Plc data. The deal allowed Ford Credit to raise money from investors without having to increase the liability side of its balance sheet, said Leandro Miranda de Araújo, Bradesco BBI's head of debt capital markets. He noted that demand for the securities was so strong that the deal was upsized and a subordinated portion was also offered to investors.""We showed that we are in a position to lead any plain vanilla or structured transaction for non-Brazilian issuers that want to sell corporate credit risk or receivables to dedicated U.S. investors or global investors,"" Araújo said.Investors placed $4 billion worth of bids for the Ford Credit securities. A first, $1 billion portion of five-year senior notes rated 'AAA' was sold at a yield of 0.52 percentage points over the five-year mid-swaps rate. Initial price guidance was for spread between 0.55 points and 0.60 points.A second, $40 million subordinated portion was sold at a yield of 0.65 points above the five-year mid-swaps rate. Another $40 million subordinated portion of the issuance remained with Ford Credit, Araújo said.In addition to Bradesco BBI, Ford Credit hired the investment banking units of Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co and SMBC Nikko Securities Inc to help with the deal.

210,"  * Registrations show modest recovery continues in Europe* Gains in Spain, Britain offset 3.6 percent fall in Germany* Volume brands outgrow premium car makers   (Adds country breakdown, analysts quote)By Edward TaylorFRANKFURT, May 16 New car registrations in Europe rose 3.6 percent in April, with mass-market marques Ford , Fiat, Renault and Opel showing stronger growth than premium brands, data showed on Friday, as heavy discounts helped boost a fragile sales recovery.Registrations in the European Union and the countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) rose 6.3 percent in the first four months of the year, according to figures from the European Automobile Manufacturer's Association ACEA. The data showed demand for passenger cars in the EU increased for an eighth consecutive month, with a 28.7 percent jump in registration in Spain helping to offset a 3.6 percent fall in sales in Germany.Sales rose 1.9 percent in Italy, 5.8 percent in France and 8.2 percent in Britain.Analysts said discounts, government incentives and cut-price sales of unused vehicles marketed as ""nearly new"" continued to prop up sales in a market expected to show modest growth this year after six straight years of contraction. ""Our most recent April channel checks suggest a stabilisation of discounts in Europe on a high level,"" analysts at JP Morgan said in a note on Wednesday.Last month, confidential research seen by Reuters showed that average retail incentives had jumped 12 percent to almost 2,750 euros ($3,800) per vehicle in the five biggest European markets, with discounting outpacing sales growth. The fact that discounts had not risen from March levels may be an indication that the price war in Europe is not getting any worse, lending credence to the notion that prices have stabilised, JP Morgan said.April registrations for Peugeot, Renault and Opel (part of General Motors ) rose 5.8 percent, 9.0 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively, the ACEA data showed. New car registrations were up 7.3 percent at Ford and 3 percent at Fiat.By contrast, Mercedes-Benz registrations rose just 1.1 percent and rival premium brand Audi (owned by Volkswagen ) saw sales grow just 0.6 percent. BMW  registrations rose 2.3 percent.Volkswagen and Hyundai were the only mass-market brands to see declines in April, recording a drop of 0.8 percent and 4.4 percent respectively, ACEA figures show.($1 = 0.7243 Euros)   (Editing by David Holmes)",2014-05-16,F,"Fri May 16, 2014 | 2:50am EDT",UPDATE 1-European new car registrations up 3.6 pct in April-ACEA,http://www.reuters.com//article/vehicleregistrations-europe-idUSL6N0O215B20140516?type=companyNews

The Detroit-based carmaker has not made money in the region since 2010.Ford's European sales could soar by 25 percent to 1.65 million cars by 2020, according to research firm IHS Automotive, as it churns out at least 25 new or upgraded models by 2017.That may count for little if it cannot raise prices. Ford's European market share bounced back in the first four months of 2014, but that was partly because it slashed prices more than rivals, according to a major market researcher. ""Prices are still as competitive as they were in the worst of times,"" said Ford's European sales chief Roelant de Waard.The second-biggest U.S. automaker has spent years searching for a premium formula that works in Europe's fiercely competitive car market, a process that saw it take on and later jettison European luxury carmakers Volvo and Jaguar.This time it is focusing on its own brand as it targets more affluent Ford buyers and drivers considering their first purchase of a high-end car. It also has customers of German premium brands BMW, Audi and Mercedes in its sights.""People assume it would be very hard to sell to them but that's not the case,"" de Waard told Reuters, pointing out that one in six owners of Ford's S-MAX model previously drove a German luxury car.Ford will also start selling its iconic Mustang sports car in Europe in 2015 and does not rule out introducing the upscale Lincoln brand at a later stage. Its Europe CEO Stephen Odell said the carmaker was on track to meet its 2015 profit goal, but the brand needs to develop further.""It's a big risk if you assume that you can't do anything,"" he told Reuters at the company's regional headquarters in Cologne. ""If you assume that all you're going to do is be squeezed, than it's a problem.""PEUGEOT, RENAULT, FIAT Ford is not alone in its upscale ambitions.French rival Peugeot is more advanced in launching its DS marque, which CEO Carlos Tavares plans to separate from the Citroen brand.

218,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) said on Thursday it is recalling 1.39 million SUVs and sedans in North America, most for the possible loss of power steering.About 1.186 million of the vehicles Ford said it is recalling are in the United States. That figure is only 2,200 shy of the total number of vehicles that Ford recalled in the United States during all of last year.  Automakers are giving heightened scrutiny to safety issues in the wake of General Motors Co's (GM.N) ongoing safety crisis that began with an ignition-switch issue in older-model cars. So far this year, GM has recalled 15.8 million vehicles worldwide. Analyst Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book said Ford's spate of recalls on Thursday may be ""driven by the heightened sense of concern all automakers are feeling right now, though we'll likely never know for sure.""Brauer added that there have been so many recalls since February when GM issued its first ignition-switch recall that the actions have become ""sort of background white noise for consumers.""

224,"  * Q4 net profit flat, misses estimates* Expects car sales to pick up in H2-FY15* Indian business records loss of 8.17 bln rupees   (Adds financial details, company comments, background)By Aradhana Aravindan and Aditi ShahMUMBAI/NEW DELHI, May 29 Tata Motors Ltd , India's biggest carmaker by revenue, reported flat fourth-quarter net profit on Thursday, with strong sales of luxury Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles offsetting losses and a big sales drop in its sluggish home market.But this month's victory for Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party in India's election has raised hopes that stalled economic reforms will get back on track and boost growth in Asia's third-largest economy.Tata is hopeful this will translate into higher sales of its trucks and buses in India, where it is the market leader for these vehicles.""We believe the economic sentiment will improve ... in the first half, leading to more positive and direct impact on our industry and our sales in the second half of this year,"" C. Ramakrishnan, Tata's chief financial officer, told reporters. Tata Motors's luxury arm Jaguar Land Rover Ltd (JLR)  has helped make up for weak sales in India where high car ownership costs and sluggish economic growth has deterred buyers of cars and commercial vehicles.But in this fiscal year, India's car sales are likely to rise marginally after two consecutive years of declines, spurred by more rapid economic expansion and tax cuts under a new government, an industry body said last month.Tata Motors reported net profit of 39.18 billion rupees ($665.48 million) for the January-March quarter, compared with 39.45 billion rupees a year ago, due to a foreign exchange loss of 3.55 billion rupees. Net sales rose 16 percent to 647.16 billion rupees. Analysts had on average expected a profit of 46.37 billion rupees, according to Thomson Reuters Starmine.Quarterly losses at Tata's Indian business widened to 8.17 billion rupees from 3.12 billion rupees a year ago, as sales of its vehicles plunged 33 percent due to high interest rates and inflation and rising fuel costs.To try to revive sales in India, Tata will launch the Bolt hatchback and Zest entry-level sedan later this year to tap into the small car market that accounts for the bulk of passenger vehicle sales in India. CHINA CALLING Tata's luxury business in Britain, which it bought from Ford Motor Co in 2008, has thrived by focusing on China, the world's largest auto market.Sales of its British-made Jaguar saloons and Land Rover sport utility vehicles (SUVs) rose 34 percent in China to 103,077 in the fiscal year ended March 31, more than it sold in North America and Europe over the same period, according to the company's website. It sold a total of 434,311 cars in the last fiscal year, a 16 percent rise.Net profit rose 19 percent in the January-March quarter to 449 million pounds ($750 million) compared with year ago period. Revenues rose 6 percent to 5.35 billion pounds.The company, part of the $100 billion Tata conglomerate, expects to start operating a new manufacturing facility in China later this year which will reduce the strain on its plants in Britain and ensure it has the capacity to meet growing demand.""We will continue to invest in more products and new technologies to meet consumer and regulatory requirements and build manufacturing capacities in the U.K. and internationally,"" Ramakrishnan said.

Google Inc shares fell 1.8 percent to $554.44 and weighed on the Nasdaq.The CBOE Volatility Index rose for a second straight day, up 3.2 percent, though it remains under 12, well below the historical average of 20. While the current level of the VIX indicates a lack of fear in the market, some investors are concerned that it also reflects a sense of complacency.Semiconductor stocks ranked among the market's leaders, with the PHLX semiconductor index up 0.6 percent. The sector rallied after Skyworks Solutions Inc raised its earnings and revenue outlook, driving its stock up 5.4 percent to $45.41. Broadcom Corp also gave a boost to chipmakers, up 3 percent at $35.87. Automakers attracted attention after both General Motors Co  and Ford Motor Co reported May sales that topped expectations. GM shares rose 0.9 percent to $35.16. Ford's stock shot up 0.7 percent to $16.55.Hillshire Brands shares rose 9.1 percent to $58.45 after poultry producer Pilgrim's Pride Corp increased its offer to buy Hillshire, known for its Jimmy Dean sausages, and topped an offer from poultry rival Tyson Foods Inc.

234,"   By Nadia Damouni | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Sears Holdings Corp's controlling shareholder Eddie Lampert met with Ford Motor Co (F.N) CEO Alan Mulally earlier this year to seek advice on how to turn around the ailing retailer, two sources familiar with the matter said.One of the sources said that Mulally, who is due to retire from Ford in July, was left with the impression that Lampert was gauging whether Mulally might be open to the possibility of becoming Sears' next CEO. The second source said Lampert, who is currently Sears' chairman and CEO, did not offer Mulally a job and there is no search process underway for a new CEO.Lampert, who is a billionaire hedge fund manager, flew to Dearborn, Michigan, where Ford is headquartered, in either February or March to meet Mulally, the sources said. In the meeting, Lampert asked Mulally about how he had turned around Ford and built an effective management structure at the No. 2 U.S. automaker, the sources said. Sears (SHLD.O) spokesman Howard Riefs declined to comment. Ford spokeswoman Susan Krusel said Mulally, 68, has not decided what to do after leaving Ford. When asked about a move to Sears, Mulally said in an interview on CNBC television on Friday, ""I am glad to share the Ford story because there are a lot of lessons learned there.""    He added, ""When I graduate on July 1st, I'm going to really think about where I am going to serve next.""Sears operates 1,900 Sears and Kmart discount chain stores in the United States. It was once the largest U.S. retailer by revenue, but has seen sales weaken consistently over recent years in the face of stiff competition from brick-and-mortar rivals such as Target Corp (TGT.N), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Home Depot Inc (HD.N), as well as online retailers like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).It would be a surprise if Mulally, who is seen as one of the most successful manufacturing executives in recent American history, considered joining Sears. Ford came out of the financial crisis much better than its U.S. rivals General Motors Co (GM.N) and Chrysler Group LLC CHRY.UL, who both went into bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the U.S. government. He came to Ford after running  Boeing Co’s (BA.N) commercial plane business. Mulally has become one of the most sought after executives in corporate America. He has signed non disclosure agreements with several companies to talk about possible leadership roles, one of the sources said. The names of the companies could not be learned. Reuters has previously reported that he was also considered for the top job at Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), who eventually appointed insider Satya Nadella to the position. It is not clear how close Mulally came to being picked as the technology giant's CEO. Lampert's meeting with Mulally also underscores the intractable problem facing big box U.S. retailers, such as Sears. They have struggled to find chief executives who have the experience and skills essential to running a modern retailer.Recruiters and directors said candidates either do not have e-commerce expertise or they lack experience running retail store chains. So boards are turning to executives from other industries or those with restructuring experience, such as Mulally.  ""The issue isn't that there aren't some great people there,"" said Bobbie Lenga, global retail practice leader at Chicago-based headhunters Russell Reynolds Associates. ""It is more of an issue that there aren't that many of them, and that many of them are at a point where they are deciding in their career what they want to do next - if they want to keep going in the industry or move on.""""It is a very finite talent pool, and you always hear the same names being brought up for all these roles,"" Lenga added. Recruiters and directors said those names include HSN Inc (HSNI.O) CEO Mindy Grossman, Bon-Ton Stores Inc (BONT.O) CEO Brendan Hoffman, Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) former president Roger Farah, and Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) retail head Angela Ahrendts, who was formerly Burberry Group Plc's CEO.Spokespeople for HSN, Bon-Ton, and Ralph Lauren declined to comment on behalf of Grossman, Hoffman and Farah. Apple was not available for comment.  BUILDING A BENCH  Lampert took over the CEO role early last year after Lou D'Ambrosio stepped down after just two years with Sears, citing family health matters. While D'Ambrosio was seen as having technology experience that could help shape Sears' online business, serving as CEO of network equipment maker Avaya and spending 16 years at IBM Corp (IBM.N), he lacked previous retail experience.Under Lampert, Sears has focused on building an internal bench of talent, its spokesman Riefs said. Such hires include Arun Arora, who leads Sears home services business and was previously general manager of global e-commerce for Staples Inc (SPLS.O); William Hutchinson who was brought over from Dell Inc to head up Sears' supply chain business unit; and Norman Miller, who was president and COO of Dollar Financial Corp and is now responsible for Sears' automotive business.""The leadership of Sears Holdings is committed to the company's successful transformation and they are excited about the momentum underway,"" Riefs said in an emailed statement. ""It's also important to know that succession planning is a critical point of focus for any company and at Sears Holdings it's a continuous discipline.""

245,"  * Exports from China to U.S., Russia could start next year - executive* Foreign exchange risks key to China export plans - executive* Volvo aims to beat China sales target for 2014 - executive   (Recasts, adds analyst quotes, background)By Norihiko ShirouzuBEIJING, June 17 Volvo Car Corp's plans to turn China into an export hub shows parent company Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co is out to disprove pessimists who have cast doubt on Chinese companies' ability to manage global consumer brands.A senior Volvo executive said the Swedish automaker would start exporting Chinese-made sedans, a long-wheel-based version of the S60 called the S60L, to the United States and the XC90 utility crossover to Russia as early as the end of next year.Volvo is also aiming to beat its 2014 sales target for  China by at least 13 percent as it opens more showrooms in the world's biggest auto market, according to the executive, who requested anonymity because he is not authorised to speak with reporters.Geely's strategy for Volvo is being closely watched as a possible model for other Chinese companies that have had limited success digesting and managing major consumer brands, following multi-billion-dollar foreign acquisitions in recent years.Geely's purchase of Volvo from Ford Motor Co four years ago surprised many in the auto industry, who doubted that a relative newcomer could turn around the loss-making 87-year-old Swedish business while protecting its famous brand.But Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight, said Volvo's outlook under the ownership of Geely and its founding chairman Li Shufu now looked ""impressive"", as Chinese demand for entry-level luxury cars soared. ""Chairman Li has been so patient with Volvo and it's finally paying off,"" he said.Investors in other Chinese firms that are struggling to manage foreign consumer brands are intensely interested in how Li, dubbed the Henry Ford of China, handles Volvo.Lenovo Group Ltd, for example, had trouble maintaining market share for years after its 2005 purchase of IBM's personal computer business, though the company is faring better recently.Another cautionary tale is SAIC Motor Corp, which bought roughly half of South Korea's Ssangyong Motor Co in 2004 but had to sell its stake after Ssangyong's business slumped in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008. CHANGING GEARS Volvo eventually would export about 10,000 S60Ls and a few thousand XC90s each year from China, the executive said. The company sold about 62,200 vehicles in the U.S. market last year, all made in Europe.Volvo felt it could minimise foreign exchange risks by adding China as a production base, despite consumer concerns about the quality of made-in-China products, the executive said.""The dollar and the yuan have the best relationship, a more stable relationship than the euro and the dollar,"" he said.Volvo aims to use two assembly plants in China to export to the United States, Russia and possibly other markets such as Southeast Asia. One plant in the southwestern city of Chengdu began producing the S60L sedan late last year, and the second is ramping up production of the XC90 in the northeastern city of Daqing.Volvo global head of media relations David Ibison confirmed that the company would start exporting from China although he said the timing and target markets had yet to be decided.Ibison said that although Volvo's China sales had grown 35 percent year-on-year so far this year, selling 90,000 cars in 2014 could be ""a step too far"".The carmaker's focus is to make sure ""our growth is profitable and sustainable,"" he said from Volvo headquarters in Gothenburg.On the sales front, the senior executive said Volvo sales in China were likely to jump by almost 50 percent on-year to more than 90,000 vehicles in 2014, making the country its biggest market ahead of the United States.That is well above the 80,000 cars Volvo initially projected to sell this year. The company sold a total of 427,840 vehicles globally in 2013, up 1.4 percent from 2012.""We are satisfied with the progress we've made so far in China,"" the executive said.Volvo's two plants in China should be able to achieve full capacity of about 250,000 vehicles a year by about 2018, helping to drive domestic sales, he said.(Editing by Stephen Coates)",2014-06-17,F,"Tue Jun 17, 2014 | 4:07am EDT",UPDATE 2-Volvo's China export plans mark new phase in Geely strategy,http://www.reuters.com//article/volvo-china-idUSL4N0OY1BG20140617?type=companyNews
246,"  LOS ANGELES Actor Harrison Ford has undergone surgery on his broken left leg that was injured in an accident on the set of ""Star Wars: Episode VII,"" the publicist for the 71-year-old actor said in a statement on Thursday.Disney, the studio behind the new ""Star Wars"" films, had said last week that Ford had hurt his ankle while filming at Pinewood Studios on the outskirts of London.Ford's publicist, Ina Treciokas, said in the statement that Ford will begin rehabilitation shortly.""He's doing well and looks forward to returning to work,"" Treciokas said. Filming on the reboot of George Lucas' blockbuster ""Star Wars"" franchise will continue on schedule while Ford recovers.The actor is reprising his role as Han Solo in ""Star Wars: Episode VII,"" directed by J.J. Abrams and set for release in December 2015. It is the first of at least three new films that will continue Lucas' saga after Disney purchased his production company, Lucasfilm, in 2012 for $4.05 billion. The film will also have original ""Star Wars"" actors Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill reprise their roles along with Ford. The film will star Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong'o, Andy Serkis, Adam Driver and Oscar Isaac.

247,"   By Allison Martell and Josephine Mason  Aluminum giants Alcoa Inc and Novelis Inc spent decades wooing Detroit's automakers to toss out their heavy steel vehicle bodies and overhaul their factories in order to mass produce vehicles made out of lighter aluminum.This year, with Ford Motor Co's launch of its new aluminum-intensive F-150 truck, they are finally reaping the benefits of that long campaign, a once-a-generation shift in demand for an industry struggling with weak metal demand.Their triumphant moment is being marred, however. A handful of up-and-coming rivals are riding their coattails into an industry that could be worth $10 billion in a decade.Since Ford unveiled the truck's new design, Constellium NV has announced plans to build a U.S. body sheet plant while Aleris Corp and Wise Metals Group are considering a foray into the burgeoning U.S. sheet market.To ensure there is a market for their metal, companies are coordinating with automakers, although in most cases their identities have not yet been disclosed.""Novelis and Alcoa are clearly long-term strong players. We believe there is room for (more) players,"" Steven Demetriou, chief executive officer and chairman of Aleris said in an interview.""We're one of the top players in Europe in automotive rolled products. We're looking to duplicate that in the United States.""Novelis and Alcoa say they are not worried about competition, given how much automotive sheet is needed. It will be several years before rivals start production, and demand may grow by 40 percent over the next decade.But the rapid shift into automotive sheet illustrates how quickly a hard-fought innovation can spill over and benefit the competition, as the industry struggles with weak margins and overcapacity, especially in the big beverage can market.""The next ten years could very well be the best for rolling mills in the industry's history,"" said independent analyst Lloyd O'Carroll.LIGHTENING UP Aluminum has made inroads in the automotive industry for decades, as a lighter alternative to steel in wheels, engines and more recently the hoods of some models. Lighter vehicles can run on less fuel, stop and start more quickly and haul heavier loads. Audi (VOWG_p.DE) and other premium carmakers have built aluminum bodies for years, but relatively high costs have capped aluminum use in the United States.That changed after U.S. President Barack Obama introduced tougher fuel economy standards in 2009.But after decades of on-again, off-again talks with Detroit, aluminum executives were not sure whether automakers were serious about using more of the light metal. For Alcoa, working with Ford meant reinvesting in sidelined research and development, shaking off skepticism after previous disappointments by other carmakers and pulling back automotive specialists deployed elsewhere.One of the biggest breakthroughs came 15 years ago when Alcoa invented an invisible coating, called A951, which makes bonds between aluminum parts more durable and longer lasting.""The technology was way ahead of the market,"" said Sherri McCleary, a 26-year Alcoa veteran and the A951's co-inventor. But even though A951 is patented, Alcoa does not have the technology to itself. At Ford's request, it is licensing it to Novelis and other rivals.Licensing was a trade off. Without it, the F-150 truck may not have happened at all, because Ford needed so much metal, and few companies would voluntarily saddle themselves with a monopoly supplier. But with it, Alcoa has less market power.""We agreed to meet our customers' needs, and we think it's going to benefit us in the long haul,"" said Michael Murphy, Alcoa's commercial vice president for automotive.UPSTART NEW ENTRANTS Automotive aluminum demand in North America is expected to rise 40 percent to 4.5 million tonnes by 2025, according to a study by Ducker Worldwide. At current aluminum prices, that is worth $10 billion and represents just under 10 percent of current global consumption.Margins for automotive body sheet are as high as $600 per tonne, six times more than in canstock, and Alcoa and Novelis say high barriers to entry will protect their hold on the lucrative market for the foreseeable future. ""It takes a strong balance sheet to do this (and) our relationships with customers are important,"" Novelis CEO Phil Martens said.But rivals are moving quickly, and Constellium and Aleris are touting their European expertise.In May, Dutch-based Constellium, counting Volkswagen among its customers, sealed a joint venture with Japan's UACJ Corp to produce automotive sheet in Kentucky, starting in 2016.Aleris, which supplies Audi and Mercedes from its Belgian rolling mill, is in the ""final stages"" of a study looking into starting U.S. body sheet production, Demetriou said.Both would compete with Alcoa's new line in Davenport, Iowa, and Novelis' recently commissioned lines in Oswego, New York. Alcoa is also adding capacity in Tennessee and Novelis has another line coming at Oswego.""It's a really big growth opportunity, and as one of the leaders in this field, we think we can really take a significant share of this growth,"" said Laurent Musy, Constellium's president of packaging and automotive rolled products. Smaller players with less financial clout and no automotive experience may enter the fray in lower-risk supply deals.U.S. can sheet maker Wise Metals is in talks with Toyota Tsusho Corp and Kobe Steel Ltd to supply coil for body panels and heat exchangers from its Alabama plant. A decision is expected in September.However the market develops, seeing Alcoa's automotive efforts pay off has thrilled McCleary after spending years refining A951 even when the market was not ready for it.""There's a lot of satisfaction in knowing that we didn't give up when we knew we had something worth hanging onto,"" she said.

248,"   By Jessica Dye and Ben Klayman  The National Highway Safety Traffic Administration said on Friday it was reviewing reports that exhaust gases, including carbon monoxide, may enter the passenger compartment of some Ford Explorers, a potential safety issue that has prompted customer complaints and a recent lawsuit.The agency said it was aware of complaints involving Ford Motor Co’s (F.N) Explorers from model years 2011 through 2014 from owners who claim they experienced exhaust fumes or other strange odors in the cabin. NHTSA was “reviewing all available data and will take appropriate action as warranted,” it said in a statement. In a lawsuit filed June 9 in Florida federal court, Angela Knutson, the owner of a 2013 Ford Explorer, said that a defect in hundreds of thousands of Explorers could cause “lethal quantities of carbon monoxide” to enter passenger cabins while the vehicle was being driven, putting occupants at risk.  Knutson filed the lawsuit on behalf of a proposed class of owners of Explorers from model years 2011 through 2013. In December 2012, the lawsuit said, Ford issued a technical service bulletin to dealers acknowledging that some Explorers from model years 2011 to 2013 “may exhibit an exhaust odor in the vehicle with the auxiliary climate control system on.”  Knutson said that Ford failed to warn customers or address the possibility that passengers may be exposed to deadly carbon monoxide, according to the lawsuit.  A spokeswoman for Ford said the company was reviewing the case and would act promptly to address any issues if needed.  Lawyers for Knutson did not immediately return requests for comment on Friday.

250,"   By Bernie Woodall | DEARBORN Michigan  DEARBORN Michigan Motor Co on Tuesday unveiled the 2015 Edge, which it hopes will strengthen sales in the fast-growing near-luxury crossover vehicle markets in China, Europe and the Americas.The redesigned Edge will be Ford’s first global crossover vehicle. It has been sold in North America since late 2006, in Brazil since 2008 and in China since 2011. The new Edge will begin sales in North America early next year and in Europe by the end of 2015.Ford is pitching the Edge as a near-luxury vehicle that can compete outside North America with premium German brands. Jim Farley, head of Ford's global sales and marketing, said that in Europe the Edge will be aimed at market-leading crossovers from Volkswagen AG's Audi, BMW and Daimler AG's  Mercedes-Benz brands.On Tuesday, Ford showed off the new Edge to reporters in Dearborn, Michigan, and Cologne, Germany. The 2015 Edge was previewed as a concept last fall at the Los Angeles auto show. “The all-new Edge is a showcase of Ford’s smartest technologies, the best of everything we have brought to market to date,” said Joe Hinrichs, president of the Americas.The two-row, five-passenger crossover vehicle shares the same mechanical underpinnings as Ford's midsize Fusion and Mondeo sedans. The global utility market, which includes SUVs and crossover vehicles, is now 19 percent of total sales, and demand has risen 87 percent worldwide since 2008, Farley said. In China, sales of such vehicles are expected to double by 2018, when one in three global utility vehicles will be sold there.Among midsize crossover vehicles in the United States this year, the Edge is second behind General Motors Co's Chevrolet Equinox, which outsells it by nearly two to one. Through May, the Equinox had sales of about 102,800, up 14 percent from the previous year, compared with 55,400 for Edge, up 0.4 percent. The 2014 Edge is priced from just under $29,000 for the base model, with the top-of-the-line Edge Sport starting at $40,445.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected GM's sales to fall about 6 percent.John Krafcik, president of car shopping site TrueCar.com,  said consumers are suffering from recall ""fatigue"" and tuning out the onslaught of bad news from GM and other automakers.He added that GM's sales remain strong in part because consumers focus on brand names such as Chevrolet and Buick rather than the corporate name ""General Motors."" Investors also showed faith in GM on Tuesday, sending its shares up 3 percent a day after the automaker's total for recalls in the half-year rose to 29 million vehicles.Chrysler Group, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Hyundai Motor Co also reported year-to-year increases. They all topped analysts' expectations, as did Ford Motor Co. Honda Motor Co Ltd  sales barely missed expectations.""Sales in the first half of 2014 indicate a steadily recovering industry, and we expect this pace to increase as we move into the second part of the year,"" said Bill Fay, Toyota Division group vice president and general manager.Ford sales fell 5 percent to 222,064 vehicles, but the company still beat the analysts' forecast of 217,007. Chrysler had a 9 percent gain to 171,086, Toyota rose 3 percent to 201,714 and Nissan was up 5 percent at 109,643.Combined Hyundai-Kia sales increased 2 percent to 118,051 vehicles.Honda sales declined 6 percent to 129,023. U.S. June sales of the Volkswagen AG group, which includes Audi and Porsche, dropped 8 percent to 49,796.Ford sales analyst Erich Merkle said the average transaction prices industry wide for pickup trucks were up more than $3,300 from a year ago. Pickup trucks are critical for the three domestic automakers because of their high profit margins.Despite substantial discounts, demand for Ford's full-size F-series pickups - the best-selling vehicles in the industry - declined 11 percent to 60,560. The automaker is changing over to a brand-new version of the F-series for the 2015 model year.GM's Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups sold a combined 58,925 in June, up a fraction from a year ago, while Chrysler's Ram pickup was up 12 percent to 33,149.Ford said sales of some of its more popular U.S. models slumped in June, including Fiesta, Taurus, Mustang and Edge.At GM, key sedans Chevrolet Cruze, Impala and Malibu all had weaker sales.

Fields, 53, took the CEO reins from Alan Mulally on Tuesday.Last year, Fields' total compensation was $10.2 million.

264,"  (Adds background, details on new forecast)MOSCOW, July 8 Russian car sales plunged 17.3 percent year-on-year in June, according to a lobby group for Europe's top carmakers, accelerating their recent slide and leading the group to slash its forecast for sales in the country this year.The Association of European Businesses (AEB) said on Tuesday it now expected sales of cars and light commercial vehicles in Russia to drop 12 percent this year to 2.45 million units - far more pessimistic than its forecast earlier this year for a 1.6 percent decline. Auto sales have tumbled in Russia as a weakening economy has been further hit by Western sanctions over Ukraine, and as people delay making large purchases. A decline this year would follow a 5.5 percent fall in car sales in 2013, which brought three years of double-digit percentage growth to an abrupt end. ""The market continues its downward trend, at an accelerating pace,"" said Joerg Schreiber, chairman of the AEB Automobile Manufacturers Committee (AMC). ""In the opinion of AMC member companies, the market weakness has not reached its bottom yet.""Western automakers such as General Motors, Ford  and Renault have invested heavily in Russia on the expectation it would soon become Europe's biggest car market.

270,"  * Ford plans to launch aluminium-intensive truck, others could follow* Could push aluminium price to $2,500 per T -Japan industry body* Premiums paid by Japanese buyers are too high -industry groupTOKYO, July 11 Prices for aluminium could climb around a third to as high as $2,500 per tonne if more U.S. automakers start producing vehicles made from the metal, said the new head of Japan's aluminium industry body.Ford Motor plans to launch a new aluminium-intensive truck this year, with speculation that other carmakers could start using more of the metal, which is lighter than steel and helps make vehicles more fuel-efficient.""If automakers follow Ford's step to use more aluminium, supply of the metal will become short and prices could rise as high as around $2,500 per tonne,"" Takashi Ishiyama, chairman of the Japan Aluminium Association, said on Thursday.He said that association members such as producers of rolled aluminium would be able to pass on a gradual increase in prices to their customers, and that they would welcome the chance to use current inventory to make products they could sell at higher prices.London Metal Exchange aluminium prices, which hit a 13-month high earlier this week, stood around $1,900 per tonne on Friday. Ishiyama said that Ford would need supply from the equivalent of a whole smelting plant to churn out its new F-150 trucks, providing a big new source of demand.He added that some Japanese aluminium product makers such as top manufacturer UACJ Corp were aiming to win a bigger slice of the growing U.S. market by adding production facilities there.But Ishiyama, also the president of Nippon Light Metal Holdings Co Ltd, said Japanese automakers had been trying to improve car efficiency through technological advances rather than shifting to aluminium vehicles. ""However, we have a long-term goal to aim to boost aluminium demand in Japan to 650,000 tonnes a year by 2035 from 400,000 tonnes now by widening the metal uses to new areas including automobiles,"" Ishiyama said.RECORD PREMIUMS  Ishiyama said that the premiums buyers must pay over LME cash prices to secure physical metal are far too high, as actual freight, insurance and other costs to get metal delivered would be around 10 percent of current premiums.Aluminium buyers in Japan have mostly agreed to pay record premiums of $400-$408 per tonne over LME prices for July-September shipments, up 8-12 percent from the previous quarter.The country is Asia's biggest importer of the metal, and the fee sets the benchmark for the region.The premiums, which have nearly doubled from two years ago and risen five-fold from five years ago, come as smelter shutdowns and logjams in releasing metal from LME storage have squeezed global supply.He said that while association members could pass on gradual rises in LME prices to their customers, it was more difficult to do the same with soaring premiums.""In some deals, we can pass on the cost of the metal and premiums, but we have more cases which we can't do that.""

271,"   By Wendell Roelf | CAPE TOWN  CAPE TOWN U.S. motor company Ford (F.N) has suspended production at one of its South African plants and Japanese car-maker Toyota (7203.T) plans to follow suit as a manufacturing workers' strike hits suppliers of car components.The two-week-old strike by 220,000 NUMSA union members, who are seeking 12-15 percent annual increases, follows on the heels of a five-month strike in the platinum sector that stunted economic growth and export earnings.The strike, which has hit the supply of beverage cans made by packaging firm Nampak (NPKJ.J), has damaged wider investor sentiment in Africa's most advanced economy, which is teetering on the brink of recession after a first-quarter contraction caused in part by the platinum strike.    Ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut South Africa's credit rating last month while Fitch put it on negative watch, both citing poor growth prospects mainly because of strikes.    Ford spokeswoman Alicia Chetty said: ""Production at our Silverton assembly plant has been temporarily suspended due to the strike."" She said only the company's Pretoria plant was affected and its other plant in Port Elizabeth was operating normally.    Jeff Nemeth, Ford's South Africa head, told Talk Radio 702 suspension at the plant - which assembles the Ford Ranger pick-up truck - would mean the loss of about 350 units a day. Nemeth said continued disruptions in the flow of products might affect corporate investment decisions in Africa's most developed but ailing economy. Toyota said it would halt some production from Tuesday because of supply chain problems related to the stoppage.    ""Toyota will close two production lines from Tuesday at our Durban plant,"" spokeswoman Mary Willemse said.     The manufacturing strike also forced General Motors (GM.N) to close its assembly plant in the southern city of Port Elizabeth over a week ago, despite efforts by Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant to mediate between the union and employees.""CRITICAL"" Mercedes Benz DAIG.ML said supply lines to its assembly factory were reaching ""critical"" stress levels and an industry body warned more car-makers could be forced to halt production.     ""Things are beyond dire. We have exhausted stockpiles we managed to build up in the months leading up to this strike and I expect more companies to halt production should the strike continue,"" Ken Manners, vice president of the auto component manufacturing body NAACAM told Reuters.Production at BMW (BMWG.DE), VW (VOWG_p.DE) and Nissan (7201.T) was normal, although company officials said on Monday they were monitoring the situation closely. Those affected include construction companies Murray & Roberts (MURJ.J) and Aveng Ltd (AEGJ.J), which are working on the construction of two major power plants for state power utility Eskom.NUMSA rejected the latest pay offer from employers in the steel and engineering sector on Sunday and called on its striking members to intensify the industrial action. Employers have offered pay rises of 10 percent in the first year, 9.5 percent in the second year and 9 percent in the third year. But unions also have grievances about the role of labor brokers in industry and do not want to be bound to a multi-year agreement, preferring a one-year deal instead. NUMSA met the main employer body, Steel and Engineering Industries of South Africa (SEIFSA), on Monday to formally reject the offer. Spokesman Castro Ngobese said SEIFSA - which said on Friday it would take its latest offer off the table if it is rejected - has taken his union's latest demand to its members for consideration. ""Meanwhile the strike continues indefinitely,"" Ngobese said, adding union leaders were due to meet on Tuesday to consider ways to intensify the strike.   Smaller union United Association of South Africa (UASA), which represents about 20,000 workers in the sector, said it was awaiting a reply from employers on questions about the offer.""We expect an answer by tomorrow and that will put us in a position to say if we accept or reject it but chances of accepting look good,"" Johan van Niekerk, UASA spokesman, said.  Separately, about 200 workers downed tools at unlisted Cape Town-based wine maker DGB, demanding a 10 percent wage hike, union leaders said. DGB, which makes some well-known brands, is offering a 7 percent raise.

But unions also have grievances about the role of labour brokers in industry and do not want to be bound to a multi-year agreement, preferring a one-year deal instead.NUMSA met the main employer body, Steel and Engineering Industries of South Africa (SEIFSA), on Monday to formally reject the offer.Spokesman Castro Ngobese said SEIFSA - which said on Friday it would take its latest offer off the table if it is rejected - has taken his union's latest demand to its members for consideration.""Meanwhile the strike continues indefinitely,"" Ngobese said, adding union leaders were due to meet on Tuesday to consider ways to intensify the strike.Smaller union United Association of South Africa (UASA), which represents about 20,000 workers in the sector, said it was awaiting a reply from employers on questions about the offer.""We expect an answer by tomorrow and that will put us in a position to say if we accept or reject it but chances of accepting look good,"" Johan van Niekerk, UASA spokesman, said.Separately, about 200 workers downed tools at unlisted Cape Town-based wine maker DGB, demanding a 10 percent wage hike, union leaders said. DGB, which makes some well-known brands, is offering a 7 percent raise.

275,"  (Corrects paragraph 9 to show target is 6.5 mln T, not 650,000 T, and that current demand is 4 mln T)* Ford plans to launch aluminium-intensive truck, others could follow* Could push aluminium price to $2,500 per T -Japan industry body* Premiums paid by Japanese buyers are too high -industry groupTOKYO, July 11 Prices for aluminium could climb around a third to as high as $2,500 per tonne if more U.S. automakers start producing vehicles made from the metal, said the new head of Japan's aluminium industry body.Ford Motor plans to launch a new aluminium-intensive truck this year, with speculation that other carmakers could start using more of the metal, which is lighter than steel and helps make vehicles more fuel-efficient.""If automakers follow Ford's step to use more aluminium, supply of the metal will become short and prices could rise as high as around $2,500 per tonne,"" Takashi Ishiyama, chairman of the Japan Aluminium Association, said on Thursday.He said that association members such as producers of rolled aluminium would be able to pass on a gradual increase in prices to their customers, and that they would welcome the chance to use current inventory to make products they could sell at higher prices. London Metal Exchange aluminium prices, which hit a 13-month high earlier this week, stood around $1,900 per tonne on Friday.Ishiyama said that Ford would need supply from the equivalent of a whole smelting plant to churn out its new F-150 trucks, providing a big new source of demand.He added that some Japanese aluminium product makers such as top manufacturer UACJ Corp were aiming to win a bigger slice of the growing U.S. market by adding production facilities there.But Ishiyama, also the president of Nippon Light Metal Holdings Co Ltd, said Japanese automakers had been trying to improve car efficiency through technological advances rather than shifting to aluminium vehicles. ""However, we have a long-term goal to aim to boost aluminium demand in Japan to 6.5 million tonnes a year by 2035 from 4 million tonnes now by widening the metal uses to new areas including automobiles,"" Ishiyama said. RECORD PREMIUMS Ishiyama said that the premiums buyers must pay over LME cash prices to secure physical metal are far too high, as actual freight, insurance and other costs to get metal delivered would be around 10 percent of current premiums.Aluminium buyers in Japan have mostly agreed to pay record premiums of $400-$408 per tonne over LME prices for July-September shipments, up 8-12 percent from the previous quarter.The country is Asia's biggest importer of the metal, and the fee sets the benchmark for the region.The premiums, which have nearly doubled from two years ago and risen five-fold from five years ago, come as smelter shutdowns and logjams in releasing metal from LME storage have squeezed global supply.He said that while association members could pass on gradual rises in LME prices to their customers, it was more difficult to do the same with soaring premiums.""In some deals, we can pass on the cost of the metal and premiums, but we have more cases which we can't do that.""

279,"  * Union plans protest marches, picketing* NUMSA rejected latest pay offer on Sunday* Strike has forced Toyota, GM, Ford to halt production   (changes dateline, adds details)CAPE TOWN, July 16 South Africa's main manufacturing union, NUMSA, said it has agreed a plan of action to intensify a three-week strike over pay that has hit car makers and construction companies.Around 220,000 workers have downed tools in demand of a double-digit wage increase, a blow to Africa's most advanced economy as it struggles to avoid recession and is still recovering from a crippling five-month strike in the platinum sector, which ended in June. The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) rejected a pay offer from employers on Sunday and said on Wednesday that it would immediately start mobilising workers for protest marches across the country. It also plans to hold lunch-time pickets and demonstrations in the auto, rubber, tyre and power sectors.""The National Strike Committee ... has developed a maximum programme of action to intensify and accelerate the strike action,"" NUMSA said in a statement on Wednesday. On Tuesday, employers in the metals and engineering sector withdrew their offer of a 10 percent annual wage increase this year, 9.5 percent in 2015 and 9 percent the following year, after NUMSA rejected it.The strike has disrupted the supply of components to automobile makers, pushing Toyota, General Motors  and Ford to halt production at their assembly plants in South Africa. Workers participating in the strike also include those from construction companies developing a new state coal-fired power station, Medupi, as well as workers from packaging company Nampak.Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, however, said on Wednesday that the strike would not affect the start of operations at the power station, which is slated for December.As well as wage increases, the strike is also about labour issues, including third-party hiring and contract workers, and housing allowances.NUMSA also wants any deal to be limited to one year while employers, who said they would take their fight to the bargaining council, are keen to lock in a multi-year agreement.

282,"  (Refiles to include omitted title for Chris Valasek, paragraph 3)By Jim FinkleBOSTON, July 22 Two security experts who a year ago exposed methods for hacking the Toyota Prius and Ford Escape say they have developed technology that would keep automobiles safe from cyber attacks.At last summer's Def Con hacking conference in Las Vegas, the two researchers, Chris Valasek and Charlie Miller, described ways to launch dangerous attacks, including manipulating the brakes of the moving Prius and the Ford Escape.Valasek, director of vehicle security research at the consulting firm IOActive, told Reuters on Tuesday that he and Miller will show off a prototype vehicle ""intrusion prevention device"" at next month's Black Hat hacking conference in Las Vegas. They built the device with about $150 in electronics parts, though the real ""secret sauce"" is a set of computer algorithms that listen to traffic in a car's network to understand how things are supposed to work. When an attack occurs, the device identifies traffic anomalies and blocks rogue activity, Valasek said.The two well-known computer experts decided to pursue the project because they wanted to help automakers identify ways to defend against security vulnerabilities in their products.""I really don't care if you hack my browser and steal my credit card,"" Valasek said. ""But crashing a car is life or death. It is dramatic. We wanted to be part of the solution."" The research the two have released on the Ford and Toyota cars, as well as work by other experts on different types of vehicles, has raised concerns that somebody might one day try to replicate their work to launch a real-life attack.Yet the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement on Tuesday that it is not aware of any incidents of consumer vehicle control systems having been hacked. The auto industry has beefed up efforts to identify and mitigate potential cybersecurity risks over the past few years.""Cyber security is a global concern and it is a growing threat for all industries, including the automotive,"" said Jack Pokrzywa, manager of global ground vehicle standards with SAE International, a group that represents industry engineers.Pokrzywa declined to comment on the specifics of the new technology from Valasek and Miller, though he said ""Any viable solution reducing cyber threats is a step in the right direction.""A representative for Ford said she had no immediate comment on the device. Officials with Toyota could not be reached for comment.

283,"   By Edward Taylor, Bernie Woodall and Ben Klayman | FRANKFURT/DETROIT  FRANKFURT/DETROIT Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co said on Thursday the crisis in Ukraine has exacerbated a sales slowdown in Russia, but the carmakers said they were on track to turn around their European operations after years of economic instability on the Continent. Ford said again it expected to have a full-year profit in Europe next year and GM reiterated its previous forecast that it would return to profitability in Europe ""by mid-decade."" Both U.S. automakers reported second-quarter results on Thursday.Ford surprised analysts with a modest second-quarter profit in Europe, while GM matched last year's $114 million loss after writing down a plant closure in Germany. Volume carmakers have struggled for decades to make money in Europe. Signs of better fortunes have emerged with economic recovery in the region, which for years has been plagued by austerity measures following a sovereign debt crisis. June figures from a European auto industry group showed that demand for passenger cars had increased for a tenth consecutive month in Europe, boosted by generous incentives for buyers.ELUSIVE RECOVERY?  A full financial recovery for GM and Ford in Europe could be elusive. Auto sales in Europe remain 19 percent below 2007 levels, and factories are running at an average 72 percent of capacity despite the closure of several plants in the past three years, according to consultancy AlixPartners. Ford and GM have restructured operations in Europe and pledged to introduce new products to that market. Opel will launch 27 models and 17 new engines between 2014 and 2018, making greater use of common designs and parts from parent GM. Ford's European sales could receive a boost as it churns out at least 25 new or upgraded models by 2017.Russia's weak demand has been aggravated by the crisis in neighboring Ukraine. Violence erupted in Ukraine's Russian-speaking east after a pro-Europe revolt in Kiev that ousted a Moscow-backed president in February and led to Russia's annexation of Crimea, causing the biggest Russia-West crisis since the Cold War. To address falling demand in Russia, GM Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens told reporters in Detroit on Thursday that the automaker has cut production by 20 to 25 percent at its main plant in Russia this year. GM also is exposed to currency fluctuations between the euro and the ruble. GM imports materials and parts from the euro zone to Russia, a potential stumbling block as tougher sanctions are discussed.GM's quarterly loss in Europe almost tripled to $305 million, a figure that included a $200 million restructuring charge for closing Opel's factory in Bochum, Germany.""Excluding the impact of restructuring, the losses in Europe were roughly $100 million, consistent with last year,"" Stevens said, describing the results as ""a pretty strong performance considering the incremental headwinds we have this year because of Russia."" Ford showed its first quarterly pretax profit in Europe in three years, despite a $329 million charge related to poor cash flow in the company's joint venture with Russian carmaker Sollers.Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said that normal plant shutdowns in the second half and rising structural costs will mean that the company is not likely to turn a profit in the second half or for the year in Europe. But the full-year results are expected to be better than 2013’s loss of $1.44 billion.Ford's new chief executive, Mark Fields, said the weakness in Russia will not keep the company from its expectation of a full-year profit in Europe in 2015. He also said Ford remains committed to its investment in Russia and joint venture with  Sollers. ""The business environment right now is very challenging and fluid,"" Fields said, referring to Russia. ""You’ve got GDP that’s slowing down which is affecting industry sales, the weak ruble,"" as well as the Ukraine crisis, he said. ""The current environment is difficult, but it's a big, important market and it has the potential to be the largest market in Europe over time.""

However, its results were overshadowed by the continued noise surrounding the costs associated with recalls, including one for a defective ignition switch linked to at least 13 deaths.The Detroit company's second-quarter profit fell short of expectations, but Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens touted strong results in the two largest auto markets - China and the United States. He reiterated GM's financial targets, including returning to profitability in Europe by mid-decade, and said overall results would be slightly stronger in the second half.Meanwhile, Ford's profit was driven by record results in North America and it reaffirmed its forecast for a full-year profit of $7 billion to $8 billion.The No. 2 U.S. automaker also repeated its warning that second-half results will reflect heavy costs related to a record number of vehicle launches, including the critical F-150 full-size pickup truck, a high-margin vehicle that is being extensively redesigned. Hyundai also warned of a tough second half as it grapples with the strong local currency. Its second-quarter profit of $2.18 billion was down nearly 7 percent, hurt by the strong won as well as U.S. discounts that hit highs not seen in more than four years.GM's net income fell to $190 million from $1.2 billion a year earlier, with its adjusted earnings per share of 58 cents missing analysts' forecast by a penny.Including the charges and costs in the second quarter, GM's recalls have accounted for about $3.8 billion in total costs so far this year. One-time items in the second quarter for GM included a charge for establishing a victims' compensation fund of at least $400 million for those killed or injured by the faulty ignition switch. Since GM has said there is no cap on that fund, which administrator Kenneth Feinberg will independently control, it said that figure could rise another $200 million.GM also changed the way it is accounting for recalls going forward, resulting in another charge of $874 million. That figure is part of the $3.8 billion total. The quarter also included a previously disclosed $1.2 billion in recall-related costs, following a $1.3 billion writedown in the first quarter. GM has recalled almost 29 million vehicles this year.GM's revenue rose slightly to $39.6 billion, short of the $40.59 billion analysts had expected. Retail sales rose 5.7 percent in both North America and its International Operations unit that includes China, but slid 11 percent in Europe and 18 percent in South America. GM's loss in Europe was wider than expected by Wall Street. Ford, on the other hand, surprised analysts by posting its first European profit in three years, leaving the company well on track to achieving its objective for full-year profit in that region in 2015.     However, Ford, like GM, lost money in South America. While GM sees things getting better in that region in the second half, Ford downgraded its outlook there, saying it now expects a greater full-year loss than it had projected previously and that the second half of the year would result in break-even results or a loss.    Ford's overall second-quarter profit rose to $1.3 billion, from $1.23 billion. Excluding one-time items, the company's 40-cent per-share profit topped analysts' expectations by 4 cents.Ford's operating margins in its home market improved to 11.6 percent but the company reaffirmed that would decline in the second half and finish between 8 percent and 9 percent for the full year. GM's second-quarter margins in North America hit 9.2 percent and officials said they remain on track to hit their mid-decade target of 10 percent.Ford's revenue of $37.4 billion topped analysts' expectations for $36.16 billion.GM shares were down 5 percent at $35.55 and Ford shares were up 0.4 percent at $17.85 shortly before the close of trading on Thursday.

Ford, on the other hand, surprised analysts by posting its first European profit in three years, leaving the company well on track to achieving its objective for full-year profit in that region in 2015.However, Ford, like GM, lost money in South America. While GM sees things getting better in that region in the second half, Ford downgraded its outlook there, saying it now expects a greater full-year loss than it had projected previously and that the second half of the year would result in break-even results or a loss.Ford's overall second-quarter profit rose to $1.3 billion, from $1.23 billion. Excluding one-time items, the company's 40-cent per-share profit topped analysts' expectations by 4 cents.Ford's operating margins in its home market improved to 11.6 percent but the company reaffirmed that would decline in the second half and finish between 8 percent and 9 percent for the full year. GM's second-quarter margins in North America hit 9.2 percent and officials said they remain on track to hit their mid-decade target of 10 percent.Ford's revenue of $37.4 billion topped analysts' expectations for $36.16 billion.GM shares were down 5 percent at $35.55 and Ford shares were up 0.4 percent at $17.85 shortly before the close of trading on Thursday.(Editing by Matthew Lewis)",2014-07-24,F,"Thu Jul 24, 2014 | 3:59pm EDT","WRAPUP 1-Ford's profit tops expectations, recall-hit GM misses",http://www.reuters.com//article/gm-ford-results-idUSL2N0PZ1RI20140724?type=companyNews

The latest economic data also failed to entice buyers. While jobless claims dropped to the lowest since mid-February 2006, new home sales fell 8.1 percent in June, the biggest decline in almost a year. The PHLX housing sector index slid 2.7 percent in its biggest one-day drop since February.The U.S. stock market's recent gains have been driven mostly by earnings, which have been strong this quarter. With 41 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported results so far, 68 percent have posted earnings that topped expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the long-term average of 63 percent. On the revenue side, 62.1 percent have beaten analysts' forecasts, compared with the historical average of 61 percent.Facebook Inc shares jumped 6.5 percent to $75.89 and hit an intraday record high of $76.74 a day after the world's No. 1 social network reported earnings and revenue that beat expectations. On the downside, Caterpillar Inc raised its full-year outlook but posted a decline in sales and its stock slid 3.1 percent to $104.92. Caterpillar, a Dow component, is the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment.""There's a tug of war in the market today between the companies that did well and the companies that didn't. Caterpillar was disappointing, but stocks remain reasonably valued and the earnings season supports continued gains,"" said Kate Warne, investment strategist at Edward Jones in St. Louis.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.63 points or 0.03 percent, to 17,081. The S&P 500 gained 0.66 points or 0.03 percent, to 1,987.67. The Nasdaq Composite  dropped 1.69 points or 0.04 percent, to 4,472.01. At its record intraday high of 1,991.39, the S&P 500 was just 0.4 percent below the 2,000 milestone.Among other stocks that made big moves after earnings, sports apparel manufacturer and retailer Under Armour Inc  surged 13.4 percent to $68.76 after the company reported that quarterly revenue rose by more than a third. The stock hit an all-time intraday high of $70.25. It was the S&P 500's biggest gainer.The benchmark index's biggest decliner was D.R. Horton Inc , the No.1 U.S. homebuilder, which tumbled 11.2 percent to $22.03 after the company reported a 23 percent slide in third-quarter profit. The results gave investors a reason to unload some homebuilders' shares.Ford Motor Co shares rose 0.7 percent to $17.90 after the company's profit beat expectations. General Motors Co shares dropped 4.2 percent to $35.83 after the company reported a much lower second-quarter profit because of numerous recalls and the expected cost of at least $400 million for its victims' compensation fund.Drugmakers Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly  both reported earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations, helped by cost controls.

Jobless claims fell to the lowest since mid-February 2006, pointing to continued strength in the labor market, but new home sales fell 8.1 percent in June, the most in almost a year, and May's initial reading of a more than 18 percent gain was revised to just above 8 percent, putting a damper on sentiment as the housing market struggles.""Housing certainly seems to be the one theme that prevents this economic recovery and earnings story from being a fairly tale, it is the one reminder there are issues,"" said Peter Kenny, chief market strategist at Clearpool Group in New York.He said the bullishness behind the strong job numbers was partly offset by market concern that it could translate into a faster route to normalizing monetary policy.

At its session high, the S&P was 0.5 percent away from hitting 2,000.Facebook was the poster child for strong earnings following a better-than-forecast 61 percent increase in revenue during the second quarter. Shares jumped 5.6 percent to $75.30, giving the social media giant a market capitalization of $193 billion, roughly the sum of Dow components McDonald's  and UTX.Sports apparel manufacturer and retailer Under Armour  jumped 10.5 percent to $67 after quarterly revenue rose by more than a third. On the flip side D.R. Horton, the No.1 U.S. homebuilder, fell 8 percent to $22.77 after it reported a 23 percent slump in third-quarter profit.The housing data also hurt homebuilders, with a sector index  down 1.6 percent.Ford shares rose 1.4 percent to $18.03 after profit beat expectations while GM dropped 4 percent to $35.87 on a lower second-quarter profit due to numerous recalls and the expected cost of at least $400 million for its victims' compensation fund.Drugmakers Bristol-Myers Squibb and Eli Lilly  both beat Wall Street expectations, helped by cost controls.

288,"  (Adds stock price, CEO comment)By Bernie WoodallDEARBORN, Mich., July 24 Ford Motor Co  reported second-quarter operating earnings that beat expectations thanks to record profit in North America, boosting its shares more than 1 percent in early trading.Pretax profit in North America of $2.44 billion and the company's first profit in Europe in three years offset weaker-than-expected results in Asia Pacific and South America.Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said lower costs boosted the company's performance in North America. Nine analysts surveyed by Reuters expected a pretax profit of $2.04 billion.Costs in the second half of the year are expected to rise as the company introduces more products, including the most important vehicle in its portfolio, the F-150 pickup truck.Ford's new chief executive, Mark Fields, said during a conference call he was ""confident"" the F-150 would launch on time without the quality problems sometimes associated with new-vehicle launches.A limited number of new F-150 trucks, which will be about 700 pounds lighter than the current version, will be available later this year. The company's operating margin in North America improved to 11.6 percent, from 10.6 percent a year ago.Ford affirmed its full-year guidance for a pretax profit of between $7 billion and $8 billion. Last year, its pretax profit was $8.6 billion.The company's outlook for South America was downgraded to a greater loss than previously expected. It now anticipates breaking even or taking a loss in the second half of the year. For the quarter, South America showed a loss of $295 million.The Asia-Pacific region's operating profit of $159 million was less than the $260 million expected by analysts. Shanks said most of that profit came from China, but didn't give a breakdown.Ford's market share in China, the world's biggest car market, rose to a record 4.6 percent.Profit in Europe ""clearly shows that the transformation plan is working,"" said Shanks of restructuring efforts that included closing a Belgian plant. Ford maintained its outlook for full-year profit in Europe in 2015.One-time items in the quarter included an accounting charge of $329 million because of poor cash flow in Russia, where Ford has a joint venture with carmaker Sollers.The quarter was Ford's last one under the leadership of Alan Mulally, who retired as chief executive and was credited with Ford's turnaround in his tenure that began in 2006.Excluding one-time items, Ford earned a profit of $2.6 billion, or 40 cents per share, which topped the 36-cent-per-share forecast by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income in the quarter was $1.3 billion, or 32 cents per share, up from $1.23 billion, or 30 cents, a year earlier. Revenue of $37.4 billion compared with $37.9 billion a year ago.Ford shares were up 1.5 percent at $18.06 in morning trading, after earlier jumping nearly 2 percent.

296,"   By Paul Lienert and Ben Klayman | DETROIT  DETROIT General Motors Co has pushed forward the launch of its next-generation full-size pickups by about nine months to fall 2018, hoping to narrow rival Ford Motor Co's still-sizable lead in meeting future U.S. fuel-economy standards, supplier sources said on Monday.Redesigned versions of GM's full-size sport-utility vehicles are expected to follow about a year later, the two sources said.GM officials declined to comment on future product plans.Like Ford with its all-new 2015 F-150, GM is dramatically lightening the next versions of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups, which are being developed under a program known to suppliers as T1XX, or T1 for short.The first versions of the current redesigned pickups debuted last year, and GM is introducing SUVs based on that platform this year.Despite the accelerated schedule, the new GM trucks still will not reach U.S. dealers until about four years after the F-150, whose design keeps the pickup's weight down through intensive use of aluminum. U.S. and Canadian dealers on Monday began ordering the Ford truck, which is expected to hit showrooms this fall.Given the weight reductions GM has already made, it may not lag its rival by much. The curb weight on a base 2015 Silverado is 4,392 pounds (1,992 kg), compared with the sub-4,500-pound (2,040-kg) total for a comparable 2015 F-150.Ford is not worried. The No. 2 U.S. automaker plans to hold onto its sales crown in the segment by continuing to refine its truck's efficiency. “It’s not like we’re sitting still after ’15,"" Ford spokesman Mike Levine said. ""We’ll continue to improve the F-150.”Tough new fuel-economy rules go into effect in 2017, spurring U.S. automakers to overhaul radically their high-margin pickups, which account for the lion's share of pretax profits at Ford and GM.But the weight reduction programs carry some risk in terms of the massive investments required to shave hundreds of pounds from those vehicles. Another risk: The possibility that some traditional truck buyers, especially commercial users, may question the ruggedness and durability of weight-saving aluminum and composites in place of conventional steel in body panels and suspensions.Those issues should be of less concern to buyers of the Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon sport utilities, which also are being redesigned and lightened under the T1 program, suppliers said. The next-generation Suburban and Yukon XL are due in fall 2019, they said. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra last week told analysts that the automaker has more substantial enhancements coming for the current Silverado and Sierra. While she and GM officials did not provide details, that includes new transmissions and engines.Bill Rinna, senior manager of forecasting at industry research firm LMC Automotive said that while future fuel-economy requirements ""are clearly in GM's sights, any major enhancements, including significant lightweighting, are not expected to occur until the next redesign"" in about four years.In addition to the efforts to trim weight from the vehicle, GM is following Ford's lead in developing more advanced engines and transmissions that will help to meet new fuel-economy targets.GM said it will begin offering new eight-speed automatic transmissions late this year on certain versions of the 2015 Silverado, Sierra and Yukon, replacing the current six-speed automatic. The eight-speed is expected to provide better towing performance and improved fuel economy. GM and Ford are jointly developing a new 10-speed automatic for their future trucks. Suppliers said the 10-speed likely will not be ready for production until the redesigned Silverado and Sierra arrive in fall 2018.GM also is planning a new family of smaller, lighter, more powerful engines similar to Ford's EcoBoost engines, with fuel injection, turbocharging and stop-start systems designed to dramatically improve efficiency.While the new trucks are still in development, both GM and Ford have raised the stakes, offering hefty incentives on current models. Despite additional dealer discounts of up to $10,000, however, sales of full-size pickups have slowed this year.Through the first six months, Ford F-series sales dipped slightly to 365,825, while combined Silverado/Sierra sales rose slightly to 333,870. Industry truck sales overall rose 8 percent during the same period.

297,"  DETROIT U.S. and Canadian dealers on Monday began ordering 2015 Ford Motor Co F-150 pickup trucks, which are lighter than earlier models, priced higher and include additional standard features, the company said.The launch of the new trucks with aluminum bodies is key for Ford as the F-150 pickups have been the best-selling vehicles in North America for 36 years and are profit centers for the No. 2 U.S. automaker.The vehicle is on its way to continuing that streak this year. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said last week the rollout of the new trucks was on target for first sales late this year, and he was confident they would launch without quality problems sometimes associated with new vehicles.The base, or non-luxury, models - the XL work truck and the most popular version the XLT - will see prices rise $395 over F-150 pickups currently on sale. The XL base price will be $26,615 including destination charges, and the XLT will begin at $31,890. Together, these two versions will account for up to 70 percent of F-150 sales, said company spokesman Mike Levine. Levine said the higher prices were due to additional standard features in all five trim levels of the F-150, and not because of the greater cost of aluminum over steel.The Lariat, the lowest priced of the luxury F-150s, begins pricing at $39,880, up $895.

298,"  DETROIT, July 28 U.S. and Canadian dealers on Monday began ordering 2015 Ford Motor Co F-150 pickup trucks, which are lighter than earlier models, priced higher and include additional standard features, the company said.The launch of the new trucks with aluminum bodies is key for Ford as the F-150 pickups have been the best-selling vehicles in North America for 36 years and are profit centers for the No. 2 U.S. automaker.The vehicle is on its way to continuing that streak this year.Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said last week the rollout of the new trucks was on target for first sales late this year, and he was confident they would launch without quality problems sometimes associated with new vehicles.The base, or non-luxury, models - the XL work truck and the most popular version the XLT - will see prices rise $395 over F-150 pickups currently on sale. The XL base price will be $26,615 including destination charges, and the XLT will begin at $31,890.Together, these two versions will account for up to 70 percent of F-150 sales, said company spokesman Mike Levine. Levine said the higher prices were due to additional standard features in all five trim levels of the F-150, and not because of the greater cost of aluminum over steel.The Lariat, the lowest priced of the luxury F-150s, begins pricing at $39,880, up $895. Levine said this version includes an eight-inch LCD screen and a rear-view camera as standard equipment. The two highest-priced versions saw the biggest price increases.

299,"  (Adds GM numbers, industry analyst's comment)By Alastair SharpTORONTO Aug 1 Auto sales in Canada in July rose to a record high for the month, up 11.3 percent from a year earlier, an industry analyst said on Friday, with strong truck sales pushing both Chrysler and Ford Motor Co to record performances.Overall, automakers sold 176,995 vehicles in July, Dennis DesRosiers of DesRosiers Automotive Consultants, said in a report. Meanwhile, Scotiabank analyst Carlos Gomes wrote in a note that sales are set to hit a record of 1.77 million vehicles this year.Gomes said volumes are being lifted by ""the best vehicle affordability in decades, low interest rates and improving consumer confidence, especially in Western Canada, where the labor market is healthiest."" General Motors Co said its July sales jumped 25 percent from a year earlier to 23,973 vehicles. Both car and truck sales gained in what the company said was its best July in Canada since 1986.Chrysler Canada sold 28,007 cars and trucks last month, up from 26,209 a year earlier, with its Ram and Jeep brands setting July records, the company said.A jump in truck sales, up 11.8 percent, offset a 19.6 percent drop in car sales in July, Chrysler said. Chrysler Canada said it was having its strongest year-to-date showing ever, with overall sales up 6 percent so far in 2014.Ford Motor Co's Canadian unit said its new-vehicle sales also hit July records, up 15 percent from a year earlier. Its line of trucks - led by the popular F-series - notched a 26.2 percent gain, while its car sales slipped 15.9 percent.Overall, it sold 28,923 vehicles in July, up from 25,188 a year earlier.

300,"  (Adds analyst comment, final annual sales rate figure, luxury sales, details)By Bernie Woodall, Ben Klayman and Paul LienertDETROIT Aug 1 Ford Motor Co and Toyota Motor Corp posted stronger-than-expected growth in U.S. auto sales in July but most manufacturers on Friday reported gains below expectations as several months of strong demand pushed optimism too high.Ford's sales were up 10 percent at 212,236, with Toyota's up 12 percent at 215,802 due to strong demand for their SUVs as well as offering larger discounts.Industry sales were up 9 percent from last year to 1,433,016 vehicles, but that still fell short of the 11 percent gain analysts polled by Reuters had expected.""Given the strength we saw over the last several months, the industry (growth) came back down at a little bit of a quicker pace than perhaps we had originally anticipated,"" said Alec Gutierrez, analyst with industry research firm Kelley Blue Book. ""I wouldn't say the industry missed the mark too egregiously.""Toyota was the No. 2 seller in July, edging past Ford, which had held that spot for the first half of this year and for 2013 overall. General Motors Co remained in top place.Incentives played a strong role in July sales. Honda Motor Co was the only one of the top car companies to cut incentives from June to July, research firm J.D. Power said. Honda's July sales tumbled 8 percent to 135,908.Average industry discounts last month rose slightly to just over $3,000 per vehicle, with Ford incentives averaging close to $3,919. Industry incentives were the highest since 2010, said Larry Dominique, president of research firm ALG.GM, Nissan Motor Co, Chrysler Group LLC  and the Hyundai-Kia Group all reported higher July sales that nonetheless failed to meet analysts' expectations. The sales were Hyundai's best for July ever, while GM, Ford and Chrysler saw their strongest results for the month since before the 2008 recession. GM said July sales were up 9 percent at 256,160. Also reporting increases were Chrysler, up 20 percent at 167,667; Nissan, up 11 percent at 121,452; and Hyundai-Kia, up 4 percent at 119,320.The Volkswagen Group, which includes Audi and Porsche, said sales fell 6 percent to 49,469.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said growth slowed further than expected as the annualized sales rate in the month fell to 16.48 million vehicles according to research firm Autodata, from 17 million in June. Economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected the annualized rate in July to ease slightly to 16.7 million.With generous credit terms drawing buyers to more expensive vehicles, transaction prices in July remained firm, averaging $32,556 per vehicle, KBB said. Ford said average prices on its full-size F-Series pickups topped $40,000, while GM's Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra's average prices were close to $39,000.Sales growth of full-size pickup trucks, a bellwether for the U.S. economy, slowed in July.Sales of Ford's best-selling F-Series rose 5 percent to 63,240 vehicles. GM's full-size Silverado had flat sales at 42,097, while the Sierra was up 5 percent to 17,488. Chrysler's Ram pickup climbed 14 percent to 35,621.In the luxury segment, Toyota's Lexus overtook Mercedes  and BMW for the sales crown in July. Lexus sold 27,333 vehicles to 27,192 for Mercedes and 26,409 for BMW. It was the first time Lexus outsold its German rivals since August 2013, KBB said.Gains in U.S. auto sales have been stronger than the overall economy since the recession. Still, the monthly figures provide an early glimpse into consumer spending.Auto sales dropped to a low of 10.4 million vehicles in 2009 and have risen steadily since, in part because of easier credit and loans of up to 84 months. They reached 15.6 million last year.

301,"   By Mary Wisniewski | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Illinois state Representative La Shawn K. Ford, who was charged two years ago with bank fraud, pleaded guilty in federal court on Monday to a substantially less serious misdemeanor charge of filing a false 2007 tax return.Ford, 42, had been accused in late 2012 of far more serious charges that he had submitted false income information in applying for a $500,000 credit line. He had faced up to 30 years in prison if convicted.Ford, a Democrat, pleaded guilty to misstating the cost of a Chicago property he sold, lowering his tax liability by $3,782.Ford, who is up for re-election this year, faces up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine. He will be sentenced Nov. 7, after the Nov. 4 election. The prosecutor's office refused to comment on why the charge was reduced.The Illinois Constitution disqualifies anyone convicted of felony, bribery, perjury or other ""infamous crime"" from holding elected office, but political experts said this is unlikely to apply in Ford's case. His attorney, Thomas Anthony Durkin, said Ford would be able to remain in office, according to the Chicago Tribune. Durkin was not immediately available for comment.Ford should win re-election in his heavily Democratic Chicago district if allowed to remain on the ballot, said Dick Simpson, a political science professor with the University of Illinois at Chicago.

302,"  TOKYO Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) posted a forecast-beating 4.4 percent rise in April-June operating profit and raised its North America vehicle sales target for the year to next March, boosted by strong sales of SUVs and pickup trucks in the United States, its biggest market.Toyota, the world's best-selling automaker, said on Tuesday its first-quarter operating profit was 692.7 billion yen (4 billion pounds), exceeding the 637.3 billion yen mean estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.North America operating profit for the period rose 45 percent to 149.7 billion yen, the company said, adding that cost cuts and a weaker yen also helped to bolster earnings.For the year to March 2015, Toyota stuck with its full-year operating profit forecast of 2.3 trillion yen. That would be a record high, although just a 0.3 percent increase from a year earlier as the tailwind from a weaker yen that helped boost export profits runs out of steam.For the current calendar year, the company trimmed its global groupwide sales forecast to 10.22 million vehicles, a reduction of 110,000 vehicles, reflecting weakness in emerging markets. ""Conditions in Thailand, India, Brazil and other emerging markets are weak,"" Managing Officer Koki Konishi told an earnings briefing.     ""But we're trying our best to get an additional 50,000 vehicles out of Japan to offset some of that, and to reach around 2.3 million in the U.S.""For the financial year to March, Toyota raised its North America sales projection to 2.71 million vehicles from 2.62 million. In July, Toyota's total U.S. sales rose 12 percent, surpassing Ford Motor Co (F.N) to become the No.2 seller for the month.  The full-year sales target for Asia excluding Japan was trimmed to 1.58 million vehicles from 1.63 million, while Europe was nudged up to 860,000 from 850,000.

311,"  * New SUV launch Aug 26, first move into premium market* Volvo to start exporting cars from China in 2015* Volvo to launch new sedan for mainly U.S., China marketsBy Alistair ScruttonGOTHENBURG, Sweden, Aug 18 With headlights shaped like Thor's hammer and space for a humidity-controlled cigar case, Volvo's new cars are sporting luxury features and designer glitz to catch the eye of the booming Chinese market and shed their safe-but-dull skin.The XC90 SUV launch on Aug. 26 will be make or break for a company moving into a premium market dominated by German rivals.It will be the first fully new car under Chinese parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co, which bought Volvo from Ford Motor Co four years ago, and heralds the revamp of its entire product range to more upmarket models.It follows a five-year, $11-billion investment programme aimed at doubling Volvo sales, which for two decades have been stuck at around 400,000 cars a year.It hopes the new line will reverse declining sales in the U.S., but must persuade customers to spend up to 100,000 euros for a brand many associate with functional family cars.""Prices will be the same level as competitors like the Germans,"" said Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson. ""Customers should not expect to buy them cheaper than an Audi.""The new cars aim to reconcile strategic tensions in the 87-year-old carmaker, which remains wedded to Scandinavian understatement, greenness and an emphasis on safety, but also wants to make swanky cars that will seduce affluent Chinese customers away from the likes of BMW, Mercedes-Benz  and Audi.The XC90 has anti-collision detectors that will brake the car on dangerous left turns, and the company says its four-cylinder engine is an industry beater in terms of combining power with low emissions.But the first preview of the car, for a small group of journalists at the company's headquarters in Gothenburg, shows design is to the fore.The seven-seater features a sleeker logo, and inside are Scandinavian touches of light wood and leather, a tablet-like, touch-screen control panel, and a minimalist dashboard. The head of the gear stick is Swedish crystal. ""This is Scandinavian design without the bling-bling,"" said chief marketing head Alain Visser. ""The XC90 is a signal that we are here as a premium brand. It is a signal that other models are going in that direction.""The XC90 will be followed next year by a S90 sedan, aimed at the United States and China, which could become the world's biggest premium market by 2020.'TOO SCANDINAVIAN' Last year Volvo owner Li Shufu was reported to have called Volvo's interiors ""too Scandinavian"", and the rollout of the new cars will show that Volvo has accepted many of the Chinese demands to make its cars more appealing to China's wealthy.""The Chinese wall has thawed,"" said Philippe Houchois, an analyst at UBS. Li's influence can be seen in the XC90 four seater, which is aimed at Asian executives with chauffeurs.Product strategy head Lex Kerssemakers recounted how Li visited the Gothenburg headquarters about two years ago and sat in the back seat of a XC90 prototype.""It doesn't work. I don't have enough space,"" he complained.Kerssemakers told his team to take the front seats and put them in the rear, and take everything out so they could redesign it to create as luxurious an environment as possible.""That would never have happened without a Chinese owner,"" he said.""Two or three times a year he comes, he has an opinion,"" Kerssemakers said. ""Why don't you try this, try that? Especially interior wise ... this is what my friends like, and they are rich customers.""CEO Samuelsson denied there had been any split, and said the company had been largely given a free hand. ""Our traditional values are getting more and more important,"" Samuelsson added. ""The one-baby policy makes safety important."" He said the company would also emphasise in China, where poor air quality sometimes makes headlines, that its vehicles come fitted with air filters to keep the fumes outside.ACID TEST Some analysts say taking on established German premium brands is a risky proposition for Li and Volvo.""It is unproven as to whether customers will accept Swedish understatement as a luxury,"" said Patrik Strom, assistant professor at the University of Gothenburg. ""But it is also risky to become too closely associated with China and lose that Swedish identity.""Sales figures will be the acid test. Without new models, sales in the United States slipped 10 percent to 61,000 last year - roughly half of what they were a decade ago. Samuelsson is now aiming at selling 100,000 cars a year by 2016.""The U.S. is very critical,"" Samuelsson said. ""Without a strong position in the U.S., we are not a global brand, we are not a premium brand. That has to work.""Volvo also sold 61,000 cars in China last year, but that was a jump of nearly 50 percent. Samuelsson said sales could beat its 80,000 target this year.Volvo has for decades been hampered by currency headwinds in times of dollar weakness against the euro and Swedish crown as the cars it sells in the United States are made in Europe.Samuelsson said the company would start exporting cars from China next year, mainly to the United States. U.S. production has been discussed but was currently off the table, he added.Volvo CFO Hans Oscarsson said moving into the premium range would eventually allow Volvo to reach margins of around 8 percent, compared with 1.6 percent last year. But for the moment, investment was the main task, so far funded in-house.""The owners have been pretty patient with Volvo,"" said Oscarsson. ""We are not profit-maximising this company. We are not stressed by quarterly reports. Of course we could have done better results, but that would sacrifice the long term.""

312,"   By Paul Lienert | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) plans to introduce a new hybrid gasoline-electric car in late 2018 to compete against the best-selling Toyota Prius, two sources with knowledge of the company's plans told Reuters on Wednesday.The compact car will be Ford's first ""dedicated"" hybrid - that is a vehicle designed to be marketed exclusively as a hybrid, rather than a variation of an existing gasoline model, such as the automaker's Fusion hybrid, the sources said. The as-yet-unnamed vehicle will be built just outside Detroit, .The sources said Ford eventually could offer several different body styles of the new hybrid, as Toyota does with the Prius. There would be different versions of the car's gasoline-electric drivetrain, including a more expensive plug-in model that can be recharged from an electrical outlet.The new Ford hybrid is expected to arrive as a 2019 model, roughly 21 years after the introduction of the original Prius in Japan. Toyota is planning to unveil its fourth-generation Prius late next year, the sources said.Ford spokesman Chris Preuss on Wednesday said the company doesn't comment on speculation about future products.Ford plans to build the new hybrid at its Wayne assembly plant in southeastern Michigan, at an annual rate of about 120,000, the sources said. Some of the hybrid technology, including electric motors, controllers and batteries, will be adapted from Ford's current hybrid models, although the dedicated 2019 model is expected to provide better fuel economy and range than today's hybrids.The 2019 model, which carries the internal code C240, will be built on Ford's new C2 global compact architecture, which also will underpin the next-generation Focus and Escape, the sources said.Ford, like other major global automakers, has been investing heavily in hybrid technology to meet increasingly stringent emissions and fuel economy standards in North America, Europe and Asia. But consumer demand for hybrids hasn't come close to meeting the industry's sales projections. Sales of the Chevrolet Volt, General Motors' (GM.N) widely advertised plug-in hybrid, have been just 10,635 vehicles through the first seven months of this year, down 9 percent from a year ago, despite heavy dealer discounts. Sales of Ford's C-Max hybrid are down 29 percent in the first seven months, to 16,444. Sales of its Fusion hybrid are up 24 percent, to 31,092, but still only account for one in every six Fusions sold in the U.S.Prius, which has been sold in North America since 2000, remains the leading hybrid in global markets. Its U.S. sales in the first seven months of this year are down 11 percent to 127,776. Last year, worldwide sales of the Prius topped 400,000. Part of the success of Prius has been attributed to Toyota's efforts to build its ""green"" car into a branded family of different hybrid models, from the tiny Prius C hatchback to the van-like Prius V. Prices start at just under $20,000.The Volt has been hampered by its higher sticker price. Even after a $5,000 price cut a year ago, the base model starts at just over $35,000, although Chevrolet dealers continue to offer discounts of up to $6,000 on that, as well as zero-interest financing and low lease rates.In about a year, Chevrolet plans to introduce a redesigned, second-generation Volt with improved features and performance, as a 2016 model, the sources said.

Gothenburg-based Volvo, one of Sweden's top exporters and employers though a small player in the global autos industry, saw demand gain traction during the end of last year and figures on Wednesday showed momentum had carried into 2014.After a 9-percent rise in sales for the first seven months of 2014, Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said he saw sales growing ""close to 10 percent"" this year compared to a previous forecast of ""a good 5 percent"".Bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, Volvo has ambitious sales goals aimed at helping fund investment needed to take on larger rivals. ""We came in at nearly 10 percent in the first half and for the full year we expect growth to continue at that level,"" Samuelsson told Reuters, pointing to continued expansion in China.""We will continue to grow faster than the market (in China) if at a slightly slower pace. We expect to have a volume of a bit more than 80,000 cars in China this year,"" he said.Lifted by China as well as recovering volumes in Europe, Volvo reported operating earnings of 1.21 billion crowns ($176.5 million) for the first half versus a loss of 577 million a year earlier. Revenues rose 15 percent to 64.8 billion.The company aims to nearly double annual sales to 800,000 cars by 2020 and make inroads in a premium market dominated by rivals such as Daimler's Mercedes-Benz and BMW .Volvo this month is launching its XC90 SUV, the first fully new car developed under its Chinese ownership, and has said it plans to price its new premium cars at the same level as those of its German competitors.While its Chinese business is taking off, a lack of new models has seen Volvo's U.S. sales fall to roughly half of what they were a decade ago, totalling only 61,233 cars last year.""In the U.S. our target is to keep volumes flat (this year). We face large challenges there and they will remain,"" Samuelsson said. ""I feel there are some initial positive indications there so I would hope that toward the end of the year we will be able to see some first positive signs also in terms of sales.""

314,"   By Bernie Woodall and Paul Lienert | DETROIT  DETROIT Chrysler Group [CHRY.UL] is planning an extensive facelift of its full-size Ram 1500 pickup in spring 2017, but has no firm plans to follow rivals General Motors and Ford Motor Co in replacing steel body panels with aluminum until a complete redesign after 2020, industry sources told Reuters.While Ford and GM are shifting to lighter aluminum body panels to dramatically reduce the weight of their best-selling full-size pickups - this fall and in the fall of 2018, respectively - Chrysler is planning to stick mainly with steel when it updates the big Ram pickup in 2017, according to two sources familiar with the automakers' plans.Chrysler is thereby sidestepping the risk of alienating commercial users, many of which believe steel is more rugged and durable than aluminum, as well as foregoing the additional investment of converting many steel parts to aluminum, as Ford and GM are doing.The two larger automakers can spread the investment over more vehicles. Ford sells nearly twice as many pickups as Chrysler, which is a unit of Italy's Fiat SpA.All three automakers are dependent on big trucks and SUVs for the lion's share of their profits. At Chrysler, those vehicles account for nearly 100 percent of pretax earnings.Fiat Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, who also heads Chrysler, told investors in May that the use of weight-saving aluminum at Chrysler ""is better suited in other vehicles than pickup trucks."" At the time, Chrysler confirmed that it would update the light-duty Ram 1500 in 2017. The current Ram 1500 was introduced in late 2008 as a 2009 model and has received several significant upgrades since then. However, the five-year future product plan shared with investors in May made no mention of when the Ram would receive a full redesign.Industry sources familiar with the company's plans said Chrysler is not likely to undertake a full redesign of the Ram before 2021 at the earliest. Chrysler spokesman Rick Deneau on Thursday said: ""We can't comment beyond what was in the five-year plan."" Asked as to whether or when Chrysler might incorporate more aluminum in future versions of the Ram, he said ""we haven't made any decisions.""   By electing not to invest as much as its Detroit rivals in aluminum, Chrysler will have to rely on other measures, including improving its engines and transmissions, to meet increasingly stringent U.S. emissions and fuel economy standards for trucks, beginning in 2018.  It is already ahead of the curve, offering versions of the 2014 Ram pickup with such fuel-saving features as a six-cylinder diesel engine, an eight-speed transmission and an automatic stop-start system.Nonetheless, by putting off a full redesign of the Ram and a shift to more aluminum, the smallest of the Detroit-based automakers risks losing ground to the Big Two after several years of booming pickup sales.Ford's F-series remains the most popular truck in the United States, with sales through July up a fraction to 429,065. GM's Chevrolet Silverado was down 1 percent to 282,776. Chrysler's Ram was up 19 percent to 239,481.Chrysler's Ram Trucks unit, formerly part of the Dodge brand, was created after Fiat acquired control of the U.S. automaker following its 2009 bankruptcy.

Nissan was up 11.5 percent. Analysts looked for gains of 11.8 percent for Chrysler and 2.8 percent for Nissan, and a decline of 1.9 percent for Ford.General Motors Co said August sales fell 1.2 percent, narrowly missing expectations. Chrysler forecast a stronger-than-expected month for the industry, up 3 percent, versus analysts' estimates of a rise of only 0.1 percent.Auto sales are an early indicator of consumer demand as the industry accounts for one-fifth of all U.S. retail spending. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected monthly industry auto sales of about 1.5 million new vehicles, and a seasonally adjusted annualized sales rate of 16.6 million. It would be the sixth straight month showing an annualized rate above 16 million, a level reached only twice in 2013.Research firm Edmunds.com pointed to two trends affecting August sales: A higher percentage of zero-interest loans and gas prices falling to their lowest in four years. Incentive spending by the industry last month also climbed from a year ago, to an average $2,772 per vehicle, but declined slightly from July, according to research firm TrueCar.com. Virtually all major automakers except Nissan boosted discounts from a year ago.Chrysler said U.S. Labor Day weekend sales were ""tremendous,"" which helped to power the automaker to a 53rd consecutive month of year-on-year sales gains.GM and Chrysler reported healthy gains in sales of full-size pickups, which provide the bulk of their profits.

The Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods jumped 10.5 percent in July on robust demand for aircraft and autos, compared to a 1.5 percent rise in June.Orders excluding the volatile transportation category slipped 0.8 percent in July, but that drop followed a 1.4 percent increase the prior month, leaving intact the upbeat trend for manufacturing activity.Separately, industry research firm Autodata Corp said auto sales rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.53 million units in August, the highest level since January 2006 and above Wall Street's expectations of a 16.6 million-unit pace.Ford Motor Co saw a 0.4 percent increase in sales, while Chrysler Group - a unit of Fiat SpA - reported a  20 percent surge. General Motors Co, however, said its sales declined 1.2 percent. Manufacturing is accelerating, with the Institute for Supply Management reporting on Tuesday that its gauge of factory activity hit its highest level in nearly 3-1/2 years in August. In addition, a measure of new orders touched a 10-year high.The factory and auto sales reports added to employment and housing data in painting an upbeat picture of the economy.BUSINESS SPENDING RISING Economists say the acceleration in factory activity suggested a pickup in business spending on capital goods and supported their forecasts for sturdy growth in the third quarter. Growth estimates for the July-September period range as high as a 3.5 percent annual pace. The economy expanded at a 4.2 percent rate in the second quarter.Separately, the Fed's Beige Book found economic activity continued to expand in recent weeks. It said manufacturing was growing broadly, with auto production boosting demand for steel and other related products.""It reinforces the current narrative of improving domestic economic fundamentals,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.U.S. financial markets were largely unmoved by the data as investors focused on the conflict in eastern Ukraine. U.S. stocks ended mixed, with Apple shares falling 4.22 percent as it grappled with a possible security breach of its iCloud service a week before the launch of its new iPhone.Orders for transportation equipment soared a record 74.1 percent in July, reflecting outsized civilian aircraft orders received by Boeing that was flagged in the durable goods orders report published last week.Auto orders rose 7.3 percent, the largest increase since March 2011, and capital goods orders surged a record 52.5 percent. But orders for primary metals, machinery, computers and electrical equipment, appliances and components fell.Unfilled orders at factories recorded their largest rise in 14 years, while inventories remained lean, both positive signs for the sector in the near term.

Putin later said his views and those of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko were ""very close"" on finding a political solution to a conflict in eastern Ukraine and that a deal between Kiev and the rebels could be reached by Friday.Data continued to point to an improving U.S. economy.

331,"  SHANGHAI Ford Motor Co will recall 191,770 cars in China from Friday to replace some parts after a quality watchdog found a fuel leak risk in the Ford Focus, the country's best-selling compact sedan.Ford's Chinese venture Changan Ford Automobile Co Ltd will recall New Focus and Classic Focus sedans produced as far back as 2009, China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said in a statement on its website.The Ford Focus was the best-selling model in the compact sedan segment last year with sales of 403,600 cars and remained top of the ranking in the first seven months of 2014, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.Carmakers in China recalled a record 5.3 million vehicles last year as regulators stepped up efforts to protect consumers. Nearly 40 percent of the vehicles were recalled after government investigations into potential defects.The Ford recall came after an inspection by the quality watchdog in response to customer complaints over fuel leak issues that experts say could potentially lead to fires.  Changan Ford had launched a customer satisfaction scheme but decided to upgrade it to an official recall to ensure all cars in question were covered and to ""alleviate any potential customer concerns"", Ford China spokeswoman Claire Li said.It is not immediately clear how the recall will affect Ford's business in China.Ford's China sales are already showing signs of a slowdown, posting a 9 percent year-on-year volume increase in August, down from double-digit growth in all other months this year and a 49 percent surge in 2013. Changan Ford, Ford's venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd, said it will replace the necessary components for free to eliminate safety hazards, according to Friday's statement.China's quality watchdog said it would monitor the recall and may require Ford to expand or renew the recall if necessary. Ford, a latecomer to the world's biggest auto market, is stepping up efforts to catch up with rivals such as GM and Volkswagen AG.

Yahoo is a favorite way for investors to play Alibaba, the massive Chinese e-commerce company, given Yahoo's stake in the company.Separately, Ford Motor Co is down 2.2 percent to $16.76 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to ""underweight"" from ""overweight.""

Morgan Stanley's call comes amid broader bearish views on the U.S. auto industry, which it cut to ""cautious"" from ""in-line,"" saying that easy credit and leasing was pulling forward demand from the future. It is cutting its price target on Ford to $16 from $17 and is lowering its target on General Motors to $29 from $33.Futures are on track for a modestly lower open on Monday, with investors finding few reasons to extend a long-running rally that has taken indexes to repeated records amid overseas concerns and few domestic catalysts.

The company's shares rose as much as 6.2 percent to $109.41 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday.Visteon's board has concluded that the two divisions have little overlap in their operations and add little value under one corporate umbrella, the report said.A Visteon spokesperson declined to comment on the report.The electronics business, which makes audio and infotainment products, amplifiers and rear-seat family entertainment systems, contributed about 20 percent to the company's annual revenue of $7.44 billion in 2013. In July, Visteon completed the acquisition of JCI, the automotive electronics business of Johnson Controls, which makes products including automotive head-up display that shows information and directions on a windshield.With this integration, Visteon's electronics business is expected to grow at a rate of 153 percent to $3.8 billion by 2017, faster than the larger climate controls business, the company said during its second-quarter conference call. The climate controls business makes heating and airconditioning systems for vehicles and contributed about 64 percent of company's revenue in 2013. Valued separately, the two businesses could be worth as much as $129 per share by 2016, Bloomberg said.In May, Visteon signed an agreement to sell its automotive interiors business to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP. The interiors business contributed about $1 billion to the company's 2013 sales. The company is yet to finalize advisors to help with the split. Any restructuring is unlikely to be finished by the end of this calendar year, the report said.Up to Tuesday's close The company's stock had gained about 44 percent in the past year, outstripping the 10 percent rise in the Dow Jones U.S. Automobiles & Parts index .DJUSAP.

339,"   By Andrea Hopkins | TORONTO  TORONTO The withdrawal of Toronto Mayor Rob Ford and the entry of his older brother in the race turned the spotlight from a volatile man who had admitted smoking crack cocaine to his less charismatic but steadier sibling, long seen as the power behind the throne.Rob Ford, 45, hospitalized this week with an abdominal tumor, dropped his bid for re-election on Friday and his  brother Doug, 49, took his place in the race to lead Canada's largest city and financial capital.Doug Ford, a first-time city councillor and businessman, has been the mayor's most aggressive advocate, defender and sometimes critic. The elder Ford was also the mayor's campaign manager.""Did the real Mayor Ford just stand up?"" tweeted Quito Maggi, a Toronto pollster and political consultant, after the  family switch just minutes before a deadline for changes to the city election ballot. ""He comes with all the positives, the same track record as his brother, but not as much of the baggage and negatives,"" Maggi added in an interview.Doug Ford is slated to hold a press conference on Friday night.  Despite being a rookie councillor elected when his brother came to power in 2010, Doug Ford has been a major force in city politics, influencing policy and serving as the mayor's spokesman. He has been at his brother's side in a string of interviews since the crack cocaine scandal erupted in 2013.And each twist in the mayor's saga came with a subplot starring his brother. In August, Doug Ford apologized to Toronto's police chief who threatened him with a defamation lawsuit for accusing him of leaking information about Rob Ford's drug use to the media.  The Globe and Mail newspaper published an investigation last year that cited anonymous sources who said Doug Ford was a mid-level hashish dealer in the 1980s, when he was in his late teens and early 20s, supplying a ""select group"" of street-level traffickers.He denied the Globe's allegations and told CNN last November that he may have sold the odd joint to a friend decades ago, but he was not a dealer. Before entering politics, Doug Ford ran the family packaging business.Political observers said that while Doug Ford may not be as charismatic as his younger brother, he comes into the race with name recognition and with his stance well-known on big issues like transportation and taxes. He was the driving force between a short-lived scheme to radically rethink Toronto's waterfront redevelopment, replacing plans years in the making with a new football stadium, ferris wheel and monorail. However, the plan gained little traction.Doug Ford also has less popular support than his brother, who has a longer history as a city councillor and in community work. Although Rob Ford dropped out of the mayoral race, he is now seeking a city council seat after his nephew stepped aside to allow him to run for the spot. ""If Doug Ford gets control of the reins, he's going to be happy to hold on to them entirely to himself,"" Peter Loewen, a University of Toronto politics professor, told CBC television.In the final episode of the brothers' talk radio show last year, the mayor admitted being ""hammered,"" or drunk, at a street festival, prompting Doug Ford to say it would never happen again because ""there'll be two hits - me hitting you, and you hitting the ground.""

342,"  * Unlikely to meet goal of 8 new model launches by end-2015* To lift exports to 50 pct of India output over five years   (Adds export plans, details on India strategy, background)By Aditi ShahNEW DELHI, Sept 12 Ford Motor Co plans to launch four new car models in India and is looking to increase the amount of locally-made parts to reduce the cost of its vehicles sold in the country, the head of its local unit said on Friday.Foreign carmakers such as Ford, Volkswagen AG  and General Motors Co are lining up new car models in India on hopes of a pickup in demand after sales fell for two consecutive years in a slowing economy. Car sales in the country are expected to grow by 5-10 percent this fiscal year. Also, India is expected to become the world's third-largest passenger car market by 2018, moving up from sixth place today, according to IHS Automotive.""Within the next 18-20 months we plan to launch four new models in India,"" Nigel Harris, president of Ford India, told Reuters in an interview. While Harris declined to give details, Ford had showcased a compact version of its Figo car, already sold in India, at the Delhi auto show earlier this year and he said there is ""a pretty strong indication that it is the right product.""Ford's sales in India have increased 9.5 percent to 84,469 vehicles in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, pushing up its market share to 3.4 percent from 2.9 percent a year ago, industry data showed. The U.S. carmaker had said in 2010 it would launch 8 vehicle models, based on its global car platforms, in India by the end of 2015, a target the company is unlikely to meet due to the economic slowdown and sluggish car sales.""We will be close to that, but a couple of the models will be deferred by a couple of years,"" said Harris.Ford continues to increase the sourcing of components from India in cars that will help reduce the vehicle cost, he said.The company exports a third of the cars it makes in India, and aims to push that to almost half over the next five years. It currently exports to 37 countries from India and plans to increase that to 50 over the same period, Harris added.

346,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. manufacturing output fell for the first time in seven months in August, but the underlying trend remained consistent with a steadily expanding factory sector. That view was bolstered by other data on Monday showing factory activity in New York state jumped to its highest level in nearly five years in September. ""The weakness in factory output in August is likely to be transitory,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. Factory production dropped 0.4 percent last month as motor vehicle production fell sharply after surging in July, the Federal Reserve said. The drop, which followed a gain of 0.7 percent in July, confounded economists' expectations for a 0.3 percent rise.Excluding automobiles, manufacturing output gained 0.1 percent in August. So far in the third quarter, factory production is running at a 4.6 percent annual pace, a sign that manufacturing will continue to support economic growth.Motor vehicle output declined 7.6 percent last month after a  9.3 percent jump in July. Economists attributed the surge in July to difficulties adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations after some automakers kept assembly lines running instead of closing plants for the traditional summer retooling.With auto sales at a 8-1/2 year high, motor vehicle production is expected to rebound.  In a separate report, the New York Federal Reserve Bank said its Empire State general business conditions index soared to 27.54 this month, the highest reading since October 2009, from 14.69 in August. A reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's factory activity. A gauge of new orders rose last month and inventories continued to shrink, keeping the balance between orders and inventories favorable.GROWING STRONGLY  ""If we can be persuaded to look though the volatility of the official data, it's evident that the U.S. economy has continued to grow strongly in the third quarter,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit in London. Third-quarter growth estimates range as high as a 3.5 percent annual pace. The economy expanded at a 4.2 percent in the second quarter. With the economic data, including retail sales and housing, continuing to be upbeat, analysts say that could result in a hawkish tilt in the Fed's statement when policymakers conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday. ""Investors will have to start getting used to the reality that the Fed is going to raise interest rates, most likely during the first half of next year,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.The dollar was trading higher against the euro and the British pound, while U.S. stocks were mixed. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt rose.Mining output increased 0.5 percent in August, while utilities production rebounded 1.0 percent.That helped to cushion the drag from manufacturing, leaving overall industrial production falling only 0.1 percent in August.The amount of manufacturing capacity in use fell to 77.2 percent last month from 77.6 percent in July, while overall industrial capacity use hit a six-month low of 78.8 percent.

353,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. manufacturing activity hovered at a near 4-1/2-year high in September and factory employment surged, supporting views of sturdy economic growth this quarter.The economic picture was further brightened by other data on Tuesday showing an acceleration in factory and services industry growth in some areas of the country. Housing, however, continues to plod along, with home price gains decelerating sharply in July.""The rest of the economy continues to deliver the goods, but the housing market is still not performing as everybody thought it would and that's going to take some time,"" said Eugenio Aleman, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.Financial data firm Markit said its preliminary or ""flash"" factory purchasing managers index came in at 57.9, unchanged from August when it touched its highest level since April 2010.Any reading above 50 signals expansion in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of U.S. economic activity. Factory jobs rose for a second straight month, Markit said, with a gauge of labor market conditions touching its highest level since March 2012. A measure of new orders held steady above the 60 level for the third time in the past four months, indicating persistent demand for manufactured goods.Manufacturing activity in the third quarter was the strongest since Markit started tracking it in mid-2007.  Separately, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond said its regional manufacturing index increased this month, with factories citing a rise in new orders and shipments.Firms in the region, which stretches along the Eastern seaboard from South Carolina to Maryland, also hired more employees and increased the average workweek, but there was some moderation in wage growth. ""The healthy performance of manufacturing is not surprising ... and reflects the pick-up in broader economic activity, a trend that has emerged since the beginning of the second quarter,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York. LIMITED EXPORT POTENTIAL Karydakis, however, cautioned that sluggish growth in the euro zone and some key emerging markets could limit the sector's export-oriented growth over the next few quarters.Data on Tuesday showed euro zone business activity in September was the weakest this year, while factory activity in China picked up only slightly. In contrast, the U.S. economy is poised for a brisk expansion in the third quarter, with estimates ranging as high as a 3.5 percent annual pace. The economy grew at a 4.2 percent rate in the second quarter. ""We expect GDP to grow at an annualized rate of at least 3 percent and as much as 4 percent, depending to a large extent on how the vast services economy fared in September,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit in London.The services sector appears to have gotten off to a strong start in September. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its new general activity index for non-manufacturing firms in the mid-Atlantic region jumped sharply.The surge in activity reflected increases in new orders, sales and full-time hiring. Service sector employees also worked longer hours, while firms increased their capital spending.In a fourth report, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said home prices increased 4.4 percent in the 12 months through July, the smallest gain since September 2012. While the cooling price increases reflect a tepid house market recovery, they are expected to stimulate demand.

355,"  DETROIT Ford Motor Co said on Thursday by year end it will add 1,200 jobs and a second shift to build the Transit commercial van at a plant in Missouri, making it the automaker's largest volume factory globally.Strong demand for the vans, which began production in April as a replacement for the E-Series, drove the decision to add the shift, Ford said. The expansion is covered, however, by the company's $1.1 billion investment in 2011, a company spokeswoman said.The additional jobs will push employment at the plant, which also builds the full-size F-150 pickup trucks, to more than 6,000 people. Ford added 2,800 jobs at the plant in the Kansas City suburb of Claycomo, Missouri, in 2013 and 2012 to support the 2015 Transit launch and increased production of the F-150. The plant builds the F-150 on three shifts and will begin production of the more aluminum-intensive 2015 F-150 early next year. The new truck goes into production first at Ford's Dearborn, Michigan, plant later this year. By year end, the plant's annual capacity will be about 500,000 vehicles, pushing it ahead of Ford's plant in Valencia, Spain, which has an annual capacity of 465,000 vehicles.Ford has said it introduced the Transit in North America in part to save costs by sharing design and engineering work around the globe. Introduced in Europe in 1965, the Transit has been the top-selling commercial van in Britain for 49 years and it is sold in 118 countries on six continents. The 2015 Transit went on sale in the United States in June and demand hit about 500 in July and almost 1,100 in August for a year-to-date total of just over 2,000. The E-Series was first sold as the Econoline in the United States in 1961 and has been the best-selling van on the U.S. market for 35 years. E-Series vans and wagons still will be available and sold side by side with Transit until late 2014. The additional jobs at the Kansas City plant mean Ford will have hired more than 14,000 hourly workers at its U.S. plants since 2011, far above the 12,000 required under the last labor deal with the United Auto Workers union.

Ford shares fell 7.5 percent and the stock was the S&P's biggest percentage decliner after it lowered its outlook late during the session, saying North American margins will be at the low end of its previous guidance.But the market ended well off its lows as worries about tensions in Hong Kong started the day off with losses of nearly 1 percent.

369,"   By Paul Lienert, Bernie Woodall and Ben Klayman | DETROIT  DETROIT If Ford Motor Co's (F.N) new chief executive Mark Fields hoped to muffle the shock of an earnings outlook rollback on Monday by unveiling aggressive growth targets for 2020, then it did just the opposite, as investors and analysts were doubtful about the ambitious plan.Fields, who succeeded popular CEO Alan Mulally on July 1, unnerved investors by cutting the company’s profit outlook for this year and next, citing the cost of recalls as well as weakness in Russia and South America. But he and his executive team also laid out an ambitious six-year plan that hinges on several key elements, notably the success of the redesigned 2015 F-150 pickup in North America and a $2.5-billion effort to rebuild the stagnant Lincoln brand in the United States and China.""Mark probably wanted to put his stamp on things early,"" said Matt DeLorenzo, managing editor of Kelley Blue Book, a leading auto website. ""He needs to appear to be a bold and decisive leader, but he has a lot on his plate.""Ford's challenges and setbacks come as U.S. sales are on an upswing. While domestic rivals General Motors Co (GM.N) and Chrysler Group FIA.MI have seen year-to-date sales rise 3 percent and 14 percent, respectively, Ford has dropped by a fraction, due in large part to the lengthy and costly changeover to the new F-150. General Motors will provide an update on profit expectations for 2014 and a long-range financial outlook on Wednesday at its investor day. GM closed down 0.87% to $31.94 on Tuesday. Ford closed down 2.12 percent at $14.79. Both companies are near their 52-week lows.The launch of Ford's aluminum-intensive F-150, which goes on sale this fall, is the most critical order of business: The big F-series truck, America's best-selling vehicle, historically has contributed the lion's share of Ford's global pretax profits.  The new model will cost more to build, Ford executives have acknowledged. And analysts said the automaker may not be able to recover all of those costs, including those associated with more expensive features and production lost through lengthy changeovers at two U.S. plants, through higher pricing for several years.""Investors should allow for lower margins"" on the new F-150 ""at least for the next few years,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in an investor note on Tuesday.Without providing details, Ford executives expressed the longer-term advantage of being the first to spend billions of dollars to take weight out of its full-size trucks and introduce smaller, more efficient engines in order to meet stiffer U.S. fuel economy and emissions regulations toward the end of the decade.""We believe this investment"" in the new F-150 ""pays off not just in 2014 and '15,"" but throughout the truck's extended life cycle, according to Joe Hinrichs, Ford executive vice president and head of the Americas. A bigger gamble is the massive investment in reviving the Lincoln brand, whose sales have been in the doldrums for years as new product investment has languished. Part of the investment covers the launch of a redesigned MKX crossover next year and a replacement for the big MKS sedan in 2016. Ford also said it will add two new Lincoln models by 2020.One of the new Lincolns is expected to be a premium compact sedan in 2018 that will share its underpinnings with the next-generation Ford Focus, according to two industry sources familiar with the company's plans.Also under consideration for 2019-2020 is a large rear-wheel-drive sedan and a compact crossover vehicle that's smaller than the recently introduced MKC, the sources said. The sources could not speak on the record because they were not authorized.But Ford is just now launching the brand in China, where it expects annual sales to reach 150,000 by 2020. Over the same period, it wants to grow Lincoln sales in North America from roughly 100,000 a year to 150,000.Those targets seem overly ambitious, said Joe Langley, an analyst at research firm IHS Automotive, which is forecasting global Lincoln sales of 150,000 in 2020, about half of Ford's target. In comparison, GM's Cadillac last year sold 250,000, including 50,000 in China.""Ford knows it needs a luxury brand to bolster margins and reduce its over-reliance on the F-series for profitability,"" Langley said. ""But it faces a multi-decade, multi-billion-dollar effort to build Lincoln into a credible luxury brand in the U.S. and China.""Bob Shanks, Ford chief financial officer, acknowledged as much to investors on Monday, saying, ""You really have to think about Lincoln as a much longer play . . . We're in an investment mode over the next five years to prepare for something much more meaningful in the next decade.""

Mulally is credited with reversing  a steep decline at Ford and returning it to profitability and an investment grade rating.Fields said he is not concerned about what he sees as short-term bad news ahead of what he calls ""a growth story,"" including an increase in Ford's global auto sales to 9.4 million vehicles by 2020 from 6.2 million in 2013. He also said that laying out the bad news to investors at a conference center in Dearborn, Michigan near Ford headquarters was a sign of progress from the days when the company delayed action on difficult issues.General Motors Co (GM.N) plans to host a similar investor day on Wednesday in Detroit.Ford CFO Shanks said the company's money-losing operations are targeted to achieve profit margins by 2020 of 7 percent to 9 percent in South America and 3 percent to 5 percent in Europe. Repairs on recalled vehicles, mainly in North America, will cost the company about $1 billion, and losses in South America are expected to be higher than previously forecast, at nearly $1 billion, Shanks said.Shanks also said that Ford now expects to lose about $300 million this year in Russia, more than previously expected. Ford is forecasting a pretax operating profit margin of about 8 percent by 2020, Shanks said, adding that the company targets break-even at two-thirds of wholesale volume by 2018.Ford said that the company will continue to make losses in South America in 2015, but not as much as this year.Ford said it is on track for the important launch of the 2015 F-150 pickup truck.

The appeals court decided it did not.Ford spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger said: ""We are disappointed in the result, and are considering our options for next steps."" The case stemmed from Ford's having made about $875 million of payments to the government in the 1990s, after the Internal Revenue Service said the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker had underpaid its taxes by nearly $2 billion in the previous decade.Ford initially treated its payments as cash bond deposits, and later converted them into advance tax payments that would bear interest in the event of an overpayment.But after the IRS concluded the payments were in fact over-payments for the tax years in question, it calculated interest only from when Ford designated them as advance tax payments. Ford countered that interest had begun to accrue on the deposit dates, and sued in July 2008. Writing for the appeals court, Circuit Judge Julia Smith Gibbons said Ford's initial decision to designate its payments as cash bond deposits ""demonstrates that the sole purpose of the remittances was to stop the accrual of underpayment interest,"" not to clear up the alleged $2 billion shortfall.She also said Ford ""may be right to criticize"" the IRS for inconsistent enforcement of Internal Revenue Code provisions governing interest on underpayments and over-payments, but that it was up to the agency to reconcile that.

General Motors Co (GM.N) said on Wednesday it expects in 2016 to ring up its first profit in Europe in more than a decade and that it will also hit targeted North American operating margins that year.The projections came two days after its smaller rival, Ford Motor Co (F.N), disappointed investors with its financial outlook. GM had previously said it would hit those targets by mid-decade, but it offered the more specific timetable and outlined other forecasts, including its plans for the critical Chinese market, at its investor meeting at the company's test track outside Detroit.Investors want more proof that GM will meet its promises.""GM is still very much in a 'show me' status with the investment community,"" Gabelli & Co analyst Brian Sponheimer said. ""That it has the confidence to target a profitable Europe is promising, but solid execution by this unproven management team will ultimately win over investors.""Shares of GM were up 1.8 percent at $32.50 in the afternoon. The stock is down about 20 percent this year and trades below its autumn 2010 initial public offering price of $33.  Investors and analysts also worry that GM is at the peak of its product cycle, having launched new versions of its full-size pickup trucks and SUVs, key profit generators for the company. GM President Dan Ammann said those views are ""sadly mistaken,"" pointing to plans to offer new or refreshed models at a rate of about 30 to 50 percent of the automaker's annual volume through 2019.""We have an absolute onslaught of product that is coming at us,"" he said. ""This is not the end. It's just the very beginning.""The No. 1 U.S. automaker also said any cash returned to shareholders would be mostly through increased dividends. In March, it paid its first quarterly common-stock dividend in almost six years. Some analysts had speculated GM might offer a broad stock buyback program, tapping its $39 billion in cash and equivalents.On Monday, Ford slashed its profit outlook for 2014, blaming higher recall costs in North America and steeper losses in Russia and South America. It also offered a disappointing 2015 profit forecast.  GM did not provide an update for its overall 2014 financial results, and analysts said the company faces the same market pressures hurting Ford. GM said in July that it was running on or ahead of pace for its previously disclosed plan to report modestly better 2014 operating earnings. Last year, GM's operating profit was $8.6 billion.GM's target for North American operating margin in 2016 is 10 percent. Chief Executive Mary Barra said the margin target for Europe factored in steps to minimize the impact of the downturn in the Russian market. GM last reported a profit in Europe in 1999.Barra, who took over as CEO in January, also said GM would not change its estimate for the expected cost to establish the fund to compensate accident victims for the defective ignition switch linked to at least 23 deaths. GM previously took a $400 million charge for the fund and said the cost could rise another $200 million. In addition to the outlook for Europe and North America, GM said it is targeting overall operating margins of 9 to 10 percent by early next decade. That would be up from 6.3 percent, excluding recall costs, in the second quarter.One way it plans to achieve its profit target is by reducing the number of core platforms on which it builds all its vehicles globally, from 14 in 2015 to four in 2025.GM is also doubling down on the world's largest auto market, outlining plans to invest $14 billion in China through 2018 to open five assembly plants and launch 60 new or refreshed vehicles. GM Financial also expects to enter China later this year, giving the automaker greater flexibility to pursue sales.Another key ambition is turning its Cadillac luxury brand into a globally recognized name. It expects to introduce four new Cadillac vehicles in North America in 2015, including the CT6 sedan it previously outlined. The brand also will introduce nine new models in the next five years in China.

""This is not the end. It's just the very beginning."" The No. 1 U.S. automaker also said any cash returned to shareholders would be mostly through increased dividends. In March, it paid its first quarterly common-stock dividend in almost six years. Some analysts had speculated GM might offer a broad stock buyback program, tapping its $39 billion in cash and equivalents.On Monday, Ford slashed its profit outlook for 2014, blaming higher recall costs in North America and steeper losses in Russia and South America. It also offered a disappointing 2015 profit forecast.GM did not provide an update for its overall 2014 financial results, and analysts said the company faces the same market pressures hurting Ford. GM said in July that it was running on or ahead of pace for its previously disclosed plan to report modestly better 2014 operating earnings. Last year, GM's operating profit was $8.6 billion. GM's target for North American operating margin in 2016 is 10 percent. Chief Executive Mary Barra said the margin target for Europe factored in steps to minimize the impact of the downturn in the Russian market.Barra, who took over as CEO in January, also said GM would not change its estimate for the expected cost to establish the fund to compensate accident victims for the defective ignition switch linked to at least 23 deaths. GM previously took a $400 million charge for the fund and said the cost could rise another $200 million.In addition to the outlook for Europe and North America, GM said it is targeting overall operating margins of 9 to 10 percent by early next decade. That would be up from 6.3 percent, excluding recall costs, in the second quarter.One way it plans to achieve its profit target is by reducing the number of core platforms on which it builds all its vehicles globally, from 14 in 2015 to four in 2025.GM is also doubling down on the world's largest auto market, outlining plans to invest $14 billion in China through 2018 to open five assembly plants and launch 60 new or refreshed vehicles. GM Financial also expects to enter China later this year, giving the automaker greater flexibility to pursue sales.Another key ambition is turning its Cadillac luxury brand into a globally recognized name. It expects to introduce four new Cadillac vehicles in North America in 2015, including the CT6 sedan it previously outlined. The brand also will introduce nine new models in the next five years in China.

389,"  * Sticks to FY guidance for now despite Ford profit warning* Says sees some recovery in Europe, ""worst behind us""* Expects to keep Ferrari sales capped at 7,000 until 2018   (Adds details, quotes)By Agnieszka FlakPARIS, Oct 2 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA)  has no need for a capital increase to fund its ambitious five-year growth plan, Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Thursday.Marchionne said, however, the board of the newly-merged company would examine all capital-boosting options, including taking on more debt, a mandatory convertible bond and a possible capital increase, at the end of the month.""A capital increase is not necessary (to fund the growth plan),"" Marchionne told reporters at the Paris auto show.FCA, which is due to list on Wall Street on Oct. 13, plans to invest 48 billion euros ($61 billion) over 5 years to boost sales by 60 percent to 7 million cars. Analysts said the targets were very ambitious, especially for the highly-indebted company.Marchionne also confirmed FCA's full-year targets, saying the carmaker was in a better position to manage the persistent weakness in the Latin American market than some competitors. For 2014, the auto group expects to raise operating profit, excluding one-off items, by as much as 14 percent. Following weak second-quarter results, analysts are expecting the company to cut its guidance.Marchionne said the company's strong position in Brazil gave it a 2 percent advantage in margin terms over other carmakers, saying the experience of Ford, which issued a profit warning this week, did not necessarily apply to its experience.However, Marchionne did say the group would look at its full-year guidance when it reviewed its third-quarter earnings.He said while there was some recovery in the European car market, there was still a long way to go. ""I'm not hopeful that the 2015 volumes are going to be substantially different (than this year),"" he said. ""But I do feel relatively comfortable saying that the worst is behind us.""Marchionne said he expected the situation in Russia, where the market slumped after Western sanctions over Ukraine, would eventually stabilise, but only in the medium term.Whoever had ""expectations about Russian volumes coming back quickly in the next 12 months is in for a big surprise"", he said. EXCLUSIVE FERRARI Marchionne, who is also due to take over the chairmanship of Ferrari, said the plan was still to keep sales of the luxury cars capped at 7,000 a year until 2018 to preserve the brand's exclusivity. However, sales could eventually be increased to keep up with demand from the super rich.""It is an exclusive brand and it needs to be religiously fanatical about the number of cars it builds each year,"" he said, but added that Ferrari had ""an obligation not to choke supply"".An initial public offering for Ferrari was not on the cards right now, Marchionne reiterated.FCA expects a new strategy focusing on exports of Maserati, Alfa Romeo and Jeeps to help override some of the weak demand in its traditional markets, especially Italy, which are only slowly recovering from a six-year slump in car sales in Europe.The carmaker will present the first new Alfa Romeo in June next year and Marchionne vowed the brand had the potential to be ""on par if not better"" than premium German carmakers.Marchionne expects the New York listing to help establish the world's seventh-largest carmaker as a global player. He is planning a roadshow in November to boost investor interest.Marchionne said the fact FCA sold more cars in North America in September than the world's largest automaker Toyota  showed the company had come a long way since Fiat helped rescue No. 3 U.S. carmaker Chrysler from bankruptcy in 2009.

391,"  * Daimler trims market growth view to 3-4 pct from 4-5 pct* VW doubts return to pre-crisis sales in Europe* Ford says momentum in Europe has flattened a bit* Renault relaunches Espace people carrier as crossover SUV* European car market link.reuters.com/cas92w   (Adds more executive comments)By Edward Taylor and Laurence FrostPARIS, Oct 2 German luxury automaker Daimler  has cut its growth forecast for the global car market, blaming cooler demand in emerging markets and a plunge in Russian sales which has put a fledgling European industry recovery in jeopardy.Speaking as the Paris auto show opened to the media on Thursday, Daimler chief executive Dieter Zetsche said he now expected the global car market to grow by 3-4 percent this year, down from a previous forecast of 4-5 percent.Other executives shared his caution, particularly over Europe where a six-year sales slump has left demand around 20 percent below pre-crisis levels and sluggish economies have put a question mark over whether the gap will close anytime soon.""Perhaps we will arrive at 13 million or 13.5 million (overall vehicle sales in Europe). But the market won't return to (the pre-crisis level of) 15.5 million, I'm sure of it,"" Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of Europe's biggest carmaker Volkswagen, said on the eve of the show. Europe's car market has returned to growth this year, although widespread incentives for buyers and government subsidy schemes in some countries have made it difficult to gauge the strength of underlying demand.A source familiar with the matter told Reuters that car sales in Germany rose by more than 5 percent in September, bouncing back from a decline in August and giving a year-to-date increase of 2.9 percent.But demand has been erratic and executives are particularly concerned about Russia -- once tipped to overtake Germany as Europe's largest auto market -- where new car sales tumbled 26 percent year-on-year in August due to a slowing economy hit by Western sanctions over the crisis in Ukraine.""Earlier this year, momentum was at the upper end of expectations but it's flattening out a bit,"" Ford Europe  Chief Executive Stephen Odell told reporters, referring to the broader European market.BMW Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer, meanwhile, said price levels in Europe had improved, but not by as much as the German carmaker's managers would have liked. He forecast it would take more than three years for the European market to return to pre-crisis levels.LONG-TERM VIEW Despite their concerns, some executives said they were keeping faith with the Russian market, and in some cases sticking to sales forecasts.""The Russian market will come back. One has to think in longer terms,"" Volkswagen's Winterkorn said. ""It's right, we cut production (temporarily in September at the Kaluga plant) but Russia will come back, I'm convinced of that."" Toyota also said it expected to ride out the worst of the slump in Russia's car market, and stuck to its goal of increasing sales to a million vehicles in Europe next year.Didier Leroy, the Japanese carmaker's head of European operations, said that while sales of entry-level cars in Russia were down 25-30 percent, hurting many of its competitors, demand for premium vehicles was down a more modest 8 percent.Vehicles such as its Camry and Lexus have helped Toyota to boost its share of the declining Russian market by about 1 percent this year, he added.With carmakers scrapping for market share across Europe, the Paris show is packed with new fuel-efficient small cars and compact SUVs designed to tap into stronger performing segments of the market.Among the new models in Paris is Renault's revamp of the elderly Espace people carrier as a crossover sport utility vehicle. It was launched on Thursday 30 years after the first model was unleashed on European consumers who hadn't yet realised they wanted one.Once the European market leader, the Espace is now one of the laggards of its category, far behind the Ford S-Max, which struck out in a sportier direction from its 2006 introduction and is unveiling another timely update in Paris.""It's a global shift affecting even family vehicles, and it is here to stay,"" Societe Generale analyst Philippe Barrier said. ""Designers are having to compromise as people look for something sportier.""Daimler's Zetsche said growth was also slowing in emerging markets such as Brazil and Argentina. But he played down fears of a sharp slowdown in China, the world's biggest car market.""Growth has slowed, but from a much broader base,"" he said. ""We must not forget that it is the second largest economy. We see double-digit growth this year.""

393,"   By Samuel Shen and Norihiko Shirouzu | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI Ford Motor Co (F.N) said on Friday it expects to boost sales in China once new assembly facilities come online and new vehicles hit showrooms in coming months, after posting its first dip in China monthly sales this year.The U.S. carmaker and its Chinese joint ventures sold 95,875 vehicles in China in September, down 0.2 percent from the same period a year earlier, the company said. That follows a 9 percent year-on-year rise in August and double-digit growth in all previous months of 2014.""We're maxed out,"" Ford spokeswoman Claire Li said, referring to capacity constraints that are crimping Ford's sales in the world's biggest auto market.She said new assembly facilities in Hangzhou and Chongqing would ease supply pressures, without providing specific sales targets for the months ahead.  The Chongqing plant would open late this year with annual capacity of 300,000 vehicles, while the Hangzhou plant would bring another 250,000 vehicles online when it began production some time next year.By the end of 2015, Ford planned to boost its total China capacity to 1.5 million vehicles, reflecting its sales expectations at that time.Li said there was no sales forecast for next year, although Ford's policy was to align capacity with sales expectations.   Ford's sales in the first nine months of the year totaled 813,412 vehicles, up 26 percent from the same period a year earlier, the carmaker said on Friday. Ford's China sales have been bolstered by strong growth in SUV models, the Ford Kuga and Ford EcoSport.  ""We look forward to our continued growth in China as we prepare to launch our new assembly plants ...

She said new assembly facilities in Hangzhou and Chongqing would ease supply pressures, without providing specific sales targets for the months ahead.The Chongqing plant would open late this year with annual capacity of 300,000 vehicles, while the Hangzhou plant would bring another 250,000 vehicles online when it began production some time next year. By the end of 2015, Ford planned to boost its total China capacity to 1.5 million vehicles, reflecting its sales expectations at that time.Li said there was no sales forecast for next year, although Ford's policy was to align capacity with sales expectations.Ford's sales in the first nine months of the year totaled 813,412 vehicles, up 26 percent from the same period a year earlier, the carmaker said on Friday. Ford's China sales have been bolstered by strong growth in SUV models, the Ford Kuga and Ford EcoSport.""We look forward to our continued growth in China as we prepare to launch our new assembly plants ...

402,"  * Sept. deliveries helped by extra selling day -analysts* Sales up only 1.3 pct if adjusted for selling days -analyst* Q4 sales may slow on strong year-ago period -analyst   (Adds comments from analysts and background)By Andreas CremerBERLIN, Oct 17 European car sales rose 6.1 percent year on year in September, benefiting from an extra selling day compared with 2013 and with brands like Volkswagen  and Ford enjoying stronger sales in Germany, France and Italy.Europe's car market bottomed out last year, the end of a six-year slump, and has posted growth for 13 straight months. But the recovery is still threatened by weak consumer confidence and geopolitical uncertainties in Russia and elsewhere and analysts cautioned that growth could slow in the fourth quarter.Adjusted for the extra selling day this year, European deliveries were up a more modest 1.3 percent compared with September 2013, and may decline slightly in the fourth quarter, compared with a strong year-ago period, said Arndt Ellinghorst, a London-based analyst with ISI Group. ""We urge investors to react with caution,"" Ellinghorst said. ""The situation is still difficult, there are only gentle impulses"" driving auto market growth.In August, growth was 1.8 percent year on year.September's new passenger-car registrations in the European Union (EU) and the countries of the European Free Trade Area (EFTA) totalled 1.269 million vehicles, up from 1.196 million a year ago, the Association of European Carmakers (ACEA) said. The International Monetary Fund last week trimmed its global economic outlook for this year and next. The euro-area economy stalled in the second quarter with Germany and Italy contracting and France stagnating.Still, ACEA data showed those three countries rebounded in September after contracting a month earlier.Sales in Germany, the region's biggest market and home of VW, Daimler and BMW, gained 5.2 percent to 260,062 models. Third-placed France was up 6.3 percent and No. 4 Italy gained 3.3 percent. Overall, nine-month European sales rose 5.8 percent to 9.91 million vehicles from 9.36 million in the year-earlier period, according to ACEA.Momentum is expected to slow in the remainder of the year and the possible return to recession in the euro zone poses a risk for demand in 2015, said Jonathon Poskitt, head of European forecasting for LMC Automotive.LMC earlier this month trimmed its full-year forecast for sales gains in Western Europe to 4.6 percent or 12.7 million vehicles. Volume growth may slow further in 2015 to 3.3 percent or 12.5 million, Poskitt said.Sales in Spain, Portugal and Greece, formerly hit by austerity measures, were up nearly 30 percent or more, stoking demand for VW's passenger-car brand, Ford and General Motors'  Opel division. Deliveries of the three marques grew 7.5 percent, 6.5 percent and 6.2 percent respectively, according to ACEA.Luxury nameplates Audi and Mercedes-Benz, both locked into an intense sales battle with premium champion BMW, rebounded from declines in August, delivering 2.9 percent and 9 percent more cars, respectively. BMW, by contrast, saw September deliveries fall 2.1 percent on top of a 2 percent drop a month earlier.PSA Peugeot Citroen, recovering from a sales slump that saw it lose billions of euros and rely on French government bailouts, posted almost 10 percent higher sales, extending year-to-date deliveries by 4.7 percent.

405,"   By Paul Lienert and Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co's (F.N) new chief executive, Mark Fields, is giving the automaker's long-moribund Lincoln brand what his predecessor Alan Mulally never could: a little love and a lot of cash.Lincoln, a storied Detroit brand which Ford has owned since 1922, has been in a swoon for the past two decades, leaving dealers and customers wondering if Ford management had left the brand for dead.Now, with the renewed backing of Executive Chairman Bill Ford and the company's board, Fields has committed the automaker to a multiyear, multibillion-dollar overhaul of Lincoln that includes a significant investment in a new premium vehicle platform that will underpin several future Lincoln vehicles, four sources told Reuters. Ford could spend $5 billion or more over the next five years to revive Lincoln, revamp its product portfolio and reposition it as a true competitor to such global luxury leaders as Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz and BMW AG (BMWG.DE), the sources said. Details of the new platform and the size and scope of the investment have not previously been reported.""It's really important for us to have a relevant and vibrant luxury brand,"" Fields told Reuters on Friday. ""You need to make the investment and build this brand over time.""He declined to discuss details about Ford's spending and product plans.Fields said Ford is looking at the Lincoln rebuilding effort ""in terms of generations of products,"" an effort that will stretch well into the next decade.Ford executives said last month that the immediate goal of the latest Lincoln turnaround effort is to triple the brand's global sales to 300,000 vehicles by 2020. Several industry analysts have challenged that mark as overly optimistic, as have some former Ford executives who spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity. A longer-range target is to restore Lincoln's luster as a premium automotive marque in the United States and build it into a formidable competitor in China, where Ford is just now launching the brand years after most of its global luxury rivals entered the China market. On Friday, Ford delivered its first Lincoln in China, an MKZ sedan.The springboard for the Lincoln revival plan is a new family of vehicles that will be built on a highly flexible premium platform that can be configured for front-, rear- and all-wheel-drive vehicles, according to industry sources familiar with Ford's plans. That is a critical element that has been lacking in several previous, under-financed attempts to resuscitate the brand. Versions of the platform will be used by both the Lincoln and Ford brands, the sources said.Former CEO Mulally, who stepped down in July, declined to make more than a nominal investment in Lincoln - and even considered selling or closing the brand, according to two sources.But his successor, Fields, has directed his management team to try to reverse a long-term U.S. sales skid that has seen Lincoln sink from the No. 1 spot in 1998 to eighth place among luxury brands, with about half the sales of General Motors Co's  (GM.N) Cadillac and one-quarter the sales of segment leader Mercedes. Last year, Lincoln sales were 81,694, less than half of the 187,121 cars it sold in 1998. FLEXIBLE DESIGN  The revival effort is backed by the first significant investment in Lincoln in years, one that will see every product redesigned or replaced over the next five years.Ford already has spent about $2 billion on Lincoln in the past two years, according to one source, about half of that to prepare for the brand's introduction this week in China and half to update and expand its product stable to tide Lincoln over until the new family of vehicles is ready toward the end of the decade.Ford has said in some years it spent only $500 million or less on Lincoln. In September, the automaker told investors it plans to spend more than $2.5 billion through 2019 on Lincoln product development, facilities and tooling.  But that figure does not include spending on engineering, advertising and other sales-related expenses for Lincoln, Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told Reuters on Friday.Much of the new investment is earmarked for development and tooling of the new premium platform, known internally as D6, sources said. The development is being overseen by new Lincoln President Kumar Galhotra, an engineer.The flexible architecture of the D6 will provide the mechanical base for a wide variety of sedans and crossovers starting in 2019, all designed to give Lincoln more differentiation from its Ford-branded siblings, as well as a stronger foundation on which to build more competitive luxury models to pit against the sector leaders.Before the first of the new D6-based models arrive, Lincoln will update most of its existing products, starting with a redesigned MKX midsize crossover in spring 2015 and a replacement for the MKS large sedan in spring 2016, sources said. The latter model will include a long-wheelbase version with more room inside for Chinese customers, Galhotra said.The Navigator fullsize utility vehicle is slated for an extensive overhaul in autumn 2017, according to sources, when it will share a version of the new Ford F-150 chassis and will get aluminum body panels.A redesign of the compact MKC crossover is tentatively scheduled in autumn 2018, the sources said.The first of the all-new D6 models, due in 2019, are a midsize sedan that could replace the MKZ and a large seven-passenger crossover that could replace the MKT, sources said. Both new models are expected to be offered in front- and all-wheel-drive versions.

In a release, Unifor said the program would have created 1,000 new jobs in Windsor, a Canadian auto manufacturing hub located just across the border from Detroit. The Globe and Mail reported on Friday that the investment could have been about C$2 billion ($1.8 billion).Ford said in a statement that for competitive reasons, it would not disclose its future manufacturing or product plans. But a spokesman for Industry Minister James Moore said that Ford asked both the federal and provincial governments for funding.""After weeks of discussions, it was determined that the terms laid out in Ford's proposal were not in the best interest of Canadian taxpayers,"" said spokesman Jake Enwright.

407,"   By Bernie Woodall and Ben Klayman | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co on Friday reported a 34 percent drop in third-quarter profit, and revenue fell due to the cost of introducing the F-150 pickup truck.Ford, which affirmed its full-year profit outlook, said earnings suffered from lower wholesale vehicle volumes and recall costs, as well as supplier parts shortages. While a strong performance in North America helped push earnings above Wall Street estimates, analysts and investors were not impressed.""No compelling new reason to either buy or sell the stock,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note. ""On the substance of the results and outlook itself, we don’t believe consensus forecasts need to change materially.""Shares of Ford were off 3.3 percent at $13.93 in morning trading.   The launch of the aluminum-bodied F-150 is on track, and Ford has completed about half of 23 global introductions planned this year, it said. The pickup is a key profit driver for the No. 2 U.S. automaker. A 3 percent drop in third-quarter revenue to $34.9 billion is largely linked to the planned shutdown of the F-150 plant in Dearborn, Michigan. Ford also said wholesale volumes fell by 3 percent, partly due to the parts shortages. Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks did not identify the suppliers or the vehicles affected but said there were four different problems across several North American plants that had been resolved. He said Ford would not recoup all of the lost production in the fourth quarter.Excluding one-time items, Ford reported earnings of 24 cents per share, which beat estimates of 19 cents from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shanks attributed that beat to North American operating results and lower tax rates.Ford's profit margin of 7.1 percent in North America lagged the 9.5 percent that crosstown rival General Motors Co reported on Thursday. Excluding recall costs, Ford's margin would have been 10.2 percent. The last time GM's North American margin was higher than Ford's was the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Barclays.Higher vehicle prices added nearly $600 million to Ford’s earnings, almost half of that derived from North America.Ford last month warned that its pretax profit this year would be $6 billion, down from a previous forecast of $7 billion to $8 billion, and that recall costs in North America would be $1 billion. About $630 million of those costs came in the third quarter.  Net income fell to $835 million, or 21 cents per share, from $1.27 billion, or 31 cents per share, a year earlier.Ford continued to lose money in Europe and in South America while being profitable in Asia as well as North America.The loss in Europe widened to $439 million from $182 million a year earlier, mainly due to weakness in Russia.Ford continued its gains in China, where it reached 4.7 percent market share, its highest yet.

416,"  (Recast with sales totals, and results from Ford, Toyota, Honda)TORONTO Nov 3 Automakers in Canada enjoyed another strong sales month in October as the market moved into the home stretch of what is shaping up to be a record-breaking year.Canadian sales rose 6.5 percent to about 154,900 vehicles, setting a same-month record for the sixth consecutive month, according to a report from DesRosiers Automotive Consultants on Monday.In September, the Canadian market hit a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2 million sales for the first time, and in October it stayed above that level, analyst Dennis DesRosiers said in his report, calling the performance ""stunning"".Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Canadian unit led in October with 22,303 car and truck sales, up 23 percent from a year earlier. Chrysler Canada said its Jeep brand sales rose 79 percent to 5,561 vehicles, while it sold 1,800 Chrysler 200 sedans, up from 816 a year earlier. GM Canada's dealers sold 22,002 vehicles, up 7 percent from a year earlier, and the company said its calendar year-to-date sales were up 5.4 percent.Ford Motor Co's Canadian unit reported a sales decline of 2.6 percent to 22,055 units, hurt by a 9.0 percent drop in car sales and a 1.1 percent fall in truck sales. Even so, Ford remained the top seller this year to date. The company has cut production of its popular F-150 pickup in recent months as it switches over to a redesigned aluminum-bodied model, set to go on sale later this year.Toyota's Canadian sales rose 2.1 percent to 17,977 vehicles, boosted by its RAV4. The sport utility vehicle's sales rose 24.3 percent to 3,791 units. Honda Canada edged up to a new October record, rising 1 percent to 15,404 vehicles sold. ""With fuel prices declining with lower oil prices we would expect light truck sales to continue to outperform passenger car sales,"" DesRosiers said in his report.The Canadian figures came as automakers reported their strongest U.S. October sales in a decade on strong demand for pickup trucks and SUVs.GM's U.S. sales missed expectations, rising 0.2 percent from October 2013.

417,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly accelerated in October and automobile sales were strong, easing concerns of a significant moderation in economic growth in the fourth quarter.The pick-up in manufacturing, which was driven by robust growth in new orders and production, suggested the economy was weathering a slowing of demand in major markets such as China and the euro zone. Factory activity is now back at the 3-1/2-year high first reached in August.""The overall growth outlook remains very resilient as the underlying strength in domestic demand clearly outweighs potential external headwinds,"" said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research.The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 59 last month from 56.6 in September. The index is now within spitting distance of its cycle high of 59.3 reached in February 2011.Any reading above 50 indicates an expansion in activity.The improvement was broad-based, and the index topped even the most optimistic estimate on Wall Street. The gauge of export orders, however, slipped. While U.S. manufacturing is gaining steam, factories across Asia and the euro zone are sputtering. Manufacturing activity hit a five-month low in China and continued to stagnate in the euro zone, separate reports showed.STRONG AUTO SALES  Back in the United States, automakers reported their strongest October sales in a decade on robust demand for brawny pickup trucks and roomy sport utility vehicles, even though top-seller General Motors Co (GM.N) missed expectations. Sales rose 6.1 percent from a year ago to 1.28 million units, pushing the annual rate to a sturdy 16.46 million units.Prices for U.S. government debt fell on the upbeat data, while the dollar rose to a fresh four-year high against a basket of currencies. On Wall Street, the Standard & Poor's 500 index .SPX and the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended slightly lower after briefly climbing to intraday records. ""It looks like the economy is going to close the year with a bang. This growth picture looks increasingly sustainable,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.The U.S. economy expanded at a vigorous 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter, although a surprise decline in construction spending in September reported on Monday could lead to a downward revision of as much as two-tenths of a percentage point.Still, more concerning had been data last week that showed weak consumer spending and business investment plans at the end of the quarter, which had fueled worry about the risks of a sharp slowdown. Now, however, fourth-quarter estimates range as high as 3.0 percent.

419,"  DETROIT Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it was calling back 202,241 vehicles in five North American recalls covering several issues, including an incorrect repair in a previous recall.The No. 2 U.S. automaker said it was aware of one accident in the case of the improperly repaired vehicles, but no injuries related to any of the issues.The company is recalling 38,645 Ford Crown Victoria, Mercury Grand Marquis and Lincoln Town Car vehicles from model years 2005 through 2011 because they may have been improperly repaired in a previous recall for an issue with the lower intermediate steering shaft that could result in loss of steering.In the autumn of 2013, Ford recalled 370,000 of the cars in the United States and Canada because corrosion of the steering shaft could result in loss of steering. In the new recall, dealers will inspect and replace the steering shaft as needed, Ford said.It is recalling 134,947 Flex and F-150 vehicles from model year 2014 because of a passenger seat sensing issue that could result in the passenger air bag not deploying in certain front crashes, increasing the risk of injury. Dealers will widen the gap between the manual seat frame and the seat track assembly and then recalibrate the seat occupant classification system, Ford said.The company is recalling 960 F-150 pickup trucks from model year 2014 because an incorrectly adjusted brake pedal position switch could cause a delay or non-illumination of the brake lights when the brake pedal is depressed.   Ford said it is advising customers not to use cruise control until the trucks have been repaired because they may need to use additional brake pressure to disengage that system. However, the cruise control off switch on the steering wheel will continue to disengage the system.Dealers will remove and reinstall the brake pedal position switch, Ford said.The other two recalls both affect Ford Transit Connect vehicles. In the first, 25,597 of the 2014 models are being recalled because the fuel and vapor lines may be incorrectly routed, which could cause a fuel leak and lead to a fire.  The second one affects 92 of the 2015 models because the bracket that holds the fuel filter to the vehicle frame may become detached over time, resulting in knocking sounds or an engine stall, which could increase the risk of a crash.In the first Transit Connect recall, dealers will inspect the lines and reroute and replace them as needed, Ford said.

423,"  BERLIN U.S. carmaker Ford (F.N) declined comment on Thursday on a report saying the head of its loss-making European operations will be replaced by a candidate from within the company.Swiss magazine Bilanz said Ford chief executive Mark Fields was set to present the automaker's new European chief of staff at the company's regional headquarters in Cologne, Germany, but did not say when this would happen or name the person.The incumbent, Stephen Odell, who has been Ford's European CEO since 2008, will be moved to a new role within the U.S. carmaker, Bilanz said. Ford of Europe spokesman John Gardiner told Reuters: ""We don't comment on speculation.""  Ford is bracing for a $1.2 billion loss in Europe this year and no longer expects to return its regional business to profit in 2015, after its third-quarter European loss widened to $439 million from $182 million a year earlier. The Detroit-based carmaker has not made money in the region since 2010.  Ford's European sales rose 12 percent in September to nearly 130,000 vehicles and its market share has bounced back during the first three quarters of 2014, but that was partly because Ford slashed prices more than rivals, analysts said. While struggling in Europe and South America, the U.S. manufacturer is profitable in Asia and North America. Excluding one-time items, Ford reported higher-than-expected third-quarter earnings of 24 cents per share, reflecting North American operating results and lower tax rates.

427,"  STOCKHOLM Nov 9 Geely-owned Volvo Car Group said on Sunday it had begun production of its best-selling XC60 crossover at its plant in Chengdu, taking a further step toward supplying locally-produced cars in China as well as opening the door to overseas exports.Volvo said in a statement the start of XC60 production would add 500 new manufacturing jobs at its plant in Chengdu, in central China, where it already makes another model, the S60L. The XC60 is Volvo's best-selling car.""The start of XC60 production in Chengdu is the latest milestone in Volvo Cars' transformation,"" Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement. ""It will be instrumental in boosting Volvo's overall growth in what is now our largest market.""Strong growth in China has helped Volvo rack up 16 straight months of rising sales though lacklustre performance in the United States - once its biggest market but now eclipsed by China - remains a headache. Volvo, bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.  from Ford Motor Co.

435,"   By Reid Spencer  Kenseth holds off Larson; Penske wins owner's titleBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed for The Sports XchangeHOMESTEAD, Fla. -- Charging away from a pack of pursuers on the final restart, Matt Kenseth scored his first NASCAR Nationwide Series win since October of last year in Saturday's Ford EcoBoost 300 at Homestead-Miami Speedway.Chase Elliott, who had clinched the driver's championship last Saturday in Phoenix, finished 17th after scraping the outside wall late in the race. Brad Keselowski delivered the Nationwide Series owner's championship to Roger Penske with an eighth-place result in the No. 22 Team Penske Ford.In a mere formality, Elliott also received Sunoco Rookie of the Year honors, making the him the first driver to win both a rookie title and a series championship in the same year in any of NASCAR's top three national series.At age 18, Elliott also is the youngest national touring series champion in NASCAR history.After losing the lead to Kyle Larson after a restart on Lap 199 of a scheduled 200, Kenseth got a second chance when NASCAR threw the 11th caution of the race for a multicar wreck behind the leader moments before Larson was to take the white flag signaling the final lap, which would have made him a winner under the caution.Instead, Kenseth pulled ahead from the outside lane after a restart on Lap 205 and took the checkered flag on the sixth lap of overtime. Kyle Busch won a drag race to the finish line to take the runner-up spot from Larson, who held third.Ryan Blaney and rookie Chris Buescher completed the top five.Kenseth won for Joe Gibbs Racing in the final outing with the company for crew chief Kevin Kidd, who moves to Roush Fenway Racing next year as director of competition in the Sprint Cup Series.""It's been a long time since I won a race in anything, so just happy for Kevin,"" Kenseth said. ""Happy to send him off with a win here. That was pretty cool. Kyle got around me on that second-to-last restart, but when he chose the bottom there, and I had Kyle (Busch) behind me, I knew we had a shot.""I just had to do a better job than I did the time before, so luckily, we got that one last chance to redeem ourselves.""Larson, who led 111 laps, spun his tires slightly on the final restart, allowing Kenseth to take the advantage.""I had good restarts up there until the last 50 laps or so,"" Larson said. ""Then I finally got a good one underneath Matt (on Lap 199) and was able to get to the lead... I was about 15 feet short of the win. Then we got the yellow, and I thought the 12 (Blaney) had been getting really good restarts, so I wanted to start in front of him (in the bottom lane).""Spun my tires a little bit, and the 20 (Kenseth) was hanging there. I was side-drafting down the frontstretch, and he was able to swerve at me and get me shaken off him. That spun my tires into (Turn) 1, and got me sideways. I was three-wide there, and that was all the 20 needed to win.""Penske won the owner's championship with five different drivers taking turns in the No. 22 Ford: Keselowski, Joey Logano, Ryan Blaney, Michael McDowell and Alex Tagliani. The championship was the fourth for Penske in the last five years (2010 Nationwide driver's title with Keselowski, 2012 Sprint Cup title with Keselowski and back-to-back NNS owner's championships).""Everyone did so much to make this happen, and obviously it didn't come down until the last lap there until we knew we had it,"" Penske said. ""Two years in a row, I think we had four championships here over the last few years, and that's really important to us as we go forward.""NASCAR Nationwide Series Race -- Ford EcoBoost 300Homestead-Miami SpeedwayHomestead, FloridaSaturday, November 15, 2014 1.

436,"   By Paul Lienert | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co F.N. said on Sunday night it was cooperating with U.S. safety regulators investigating a report the driver of a 2007 Ford Mustang was injured in August by a metal fragment from the car’s air bag.The 2007 Mustang was part of a June recall of millions of cars from nine manufacturers because air bag inflators made by Japanese supplier Takata Corp (7312.T) could rupture and send metal fragments into the cabin.The so-called “regional recalls” were carried out mainly in high-humidity states such as Florida after Takata said the inflators could be susceptible to rupture if exposed to moisture or extreme humidity.North Carolina is not one of the high-humidity states listed in Ford’s June recall, which covered Florida, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The 2007 Mustang owner’s complaint was filed on Oct. 30 with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).Ford could not confirm that the 2007 Mustang involved in the North Carolina accident was equipped with Takata air bags. In a statement released on Sunday night, Ford said: “Based on the field reports and testing currently available, the Takata airbag inflator designs used in Ford vehicles have not shown the same risk of fragmentation as other Takata airbag inflator designs used by other manufacturers. We are continuing to investigate this issue, and we are cooperating fully with NHTSA and Takata.”Ford’s June recall covered 58,669 cars. It was expanded in late October to 85,023 cars, including about 61,000 Mustangs from model years 2005-2008; 23,700 Ford Ranger pickups from model years 2004-2005, and 256 Ford GT sports cars from 2005-2006. A Takata spokesman was not immediately available for comment.The NHTSA complaint about the August accident in North Carolina said the Mustang “crashed into the rear end of another vehicle” at about 35 miles per hour. “The air bag deployed with abrupt force and a metal fragment dislodged, causing injury to the driver’s leg, which required medical attention,” the complaint said. Ruptured inflators in Takata air bags have been linked to four deaths in the United States and one in Malaysia, all in Honda vehicles. NHTSA has received dozens of complaints linked to the air bags.The U.S. safety agency on Friday said Takata-related recalls since April 2013 number around 8 million. Before then, Honda alone had recalled more than 2.5 million cars, dating to November 2008, to replace defective inflators in Takata air bags.

442,"   By Martin Dokoupil | DUBAI  DUBAI Ford Motor Co's (F.N) drive to make its sport utility vehicles (SUV) and other models lighter to save fuel and boost performance will not be delayed by a recent drop in oil prices, Executive Chairman Bill Ford said on Wednesday.The No. 2 U.S. automaker this month started production of a redesigned, aluminium-intensive F-150 full-size pickup truck -- its key profit generator. It has said it could incorporate more of the light metal into its models in the future.Asked whether a plunge in oil prices -- Brent fell to more than a four-year low of below $77 per barrel LCOc1 last week  -- gave the company second thoughts about all the investment to make pickup trucks lighter, Ford told Reuters: ""No, not at all.""""I think our customers ... will find a better truck because of it, not just a more fuel-efficient truck,"" he said, standing next to a bright yellow Ford Mustang GT convertible on the 112th floor of Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest tower, in Dubai. ""And on other products, we will continue to lightweight but it won’t only be aluminium. We will be using other materials as well that will lightweight our vehicles,"" he said. The F-150, the best-selling vehicle in the U.S. market for 32 straight years, has contributed the lion's share of Ford's global pretax profit, and its latest launch is closely watched by analysts and investors.Ford is in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the iconic Mustang sports car, which was cut in six pieces and taken up by lifts to be reassembled at an outside terrace of the Dubai skyscraper.The carmaker is betting on future growth in oil wealthy Gulf Arab countries, where low, subsidized petrol prices fuel sales of gas-guzzling SUVs, planning to bring 25 new products to the Middle East in the next two years.     The UAE, the second largest Arab economy after Saudi Arabia, is the biggest market for Mustang cars outside of North America. The new F-150 is expected to head to the region in early 2015 after the December sale launch in North America.Asked whether it made sense for the company to set up a new assembly plant in the Middle East or North Africa, Ford said: ""Perhaps but it is too early for us to make that determination. We are certainly looking at it.""Industry sales in the Middle East and Africa are expected to soar 40 percent to 5.5 million vehicles by 2020, the carmaker expects. Ford, unlike rival General Motors (GM.N), does not plan to set up a formal corporate venture fund to invest in cutting-edge future mobility technologies, but rather will continue investing through a private venture capital fund with several partners.""We certainly looked at going that route but I think it is absolutely a wrong thing to do,"" Ford said, adding that venture capital firms he visited in Silicon Valley pointed out to him that almost all venture capital effort by a corporation fails. ""I believe our role is best as a quick adaptor of new technology, to be very nimble, to realize who's the best out there, who’s newest to market and then go with them,"" he said.

443,"  BUCHAREST Nov 19 Ford Motor Co will lay off about 680 people at its Romanian division next year, or some 20 percent of the staff, as it adjusts to a weak European market, the carmaker said on Wednesday.Ford took over struggling Romanian carmaker Automobile Craiova in 2008 and started producing its B-Max model there two years ago. However, low demand has led to regular production stoppages each month for more than a year.""To help better secure the competitiveness of the Craiova facility, and to control operational costs, it is necessary to take further measures to adjust production volumes to the current market demand,"" Ford Romania said in a statement. ""This also requires a reduction in the workforce."" The firm said it will first implement a voluntary redundancy programme both at its car division and at its engine production unit, giving employees until Dec. 18 to choose. ""These actions are intended to best utilise the remaining workforce at Craiova and to meet current and expected future production requirements as Ford continues to seek opportunities to source a second vehicle in Craiova.""

444,"  * Sees U.S. sales above 100,000 cars in medium term* Seeks to reverse decade of falling U.S. sales* Complete model revewal over 5 years to underpin goalBy Niklas PollardSTOCKHOLM, Nov 19 Chinese-owned Volvo Car Group said on Wednesday a sweeping overhaul of its model range over the next five years would propel its long-suffering sales volumes in the United States back above 100,000 cars per year. Strong growth in China and more modest gains in Europe have helped Volvo grow sales for 16 straight months. However, turnover in the United States, once its biggest market but now eclipsed by China, has been eroding over the past decade.Volvo, bought by Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.  from Ford Motor Co. in 2010, said it expected to reach its sales target ""in the medium term"" and sought to dispel doubts it had a future in the vast U.S. market.The Swedish car brand is up against much larger luxury rivals at a time when the global industry is shifting to a smaller number of vehicle platforms to exploit economies of scale while offering a broader array of models. Volvo Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson believes Volvo can compete with a more focused offering and just one core engine family.""Volvo is in the US to stay. Not only will we stay, we will prosper,"" Samuelsson said in a statement. We sold over 100,000 cars a year in the US in the past. Our initial aim is to get back to that level and in the longer term surpass it."" Volvo, which expects to sell only about 60,000 cars in U.S. this year, is seeking to generate enough global sales to support the billions of dollars in investment in new vehicles needed to remain viable in a cut-throat car industry.Volvo last sold more than a 100,000 cars in the United States in 2007, its best year globally before a sharp downturn hit auto sales across the world as the financial crisis struck. U.S. auto industry sales rose to more than 15 million vehicles last year.The Gothenburg-based car maker aims to nearly double annual sales to 800,000 cars by 2020 and stake out a claim in a premium market dominated by Daimler's Mercedes-Benz, BMW  and Volkswagen's Audi.Volvo said the plan to revive its U.S. fortunes also included doubling its marketing budget, developing its dealer network to support its new products and bolstering its service business. It has already replaced some top management there.

446,"   By Samuel Shen and Kazunori Takada | GUANGZHOU China  GUANGZHOU China BMW's (BMWG.DE) China head expects profit margins to narrow as the German premium automaker steps up localization to maintain double-digit growth amid slowing demand and tougher competition in the world's biggest auto market.""Everything is normalizing in China - the market growth, the volume growth, the margin growth,"" said Karsten Engel, BMW's China chief executive. Engel was speaking in an interview with Reuters at the Guangzhou autoshow on Thursday.""In the coming years...we expect the premium market (in China) to grow around 10 percent, and for us, a little bit more. The breakneck growth of 30 to 40 percent will not come back again,"" Engel said.A sudden slowdown in China's car market in the middle of the year knocked BMW's third-quarter China growth to about 8 percent, from over 20 percent in the first half.  ""In the middle of the year...the dealers said, 'Stocks are building up and we should be careful,' so we reduced supply and we reduced a bit of speed,"" Engel said. ""That's why Q3 was a bit lower.""        To beat the broader market, BMW aims to double the range of locally produced models to six in the course of the current decade, Engel said. That strategy would enable BMW to avoid hefty import taxes and price the cars more competitively in China. German brands BMW, Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen AG's (VOWG_p.DE) Audi AG (NSUG.DE) currently dominate China's premium car market. But they're being increasingly challenged by newcomers such as Lincoln, the luxury brand owned by Ford Motor Co (F.N), and Nissan Motor Co Ltd's (7201.T) Infiniti.Competition and the ongoing trend of selling smaller, and cheaper premium models are weighing on margins.  ""What we do see is the trend downwards,"" Engel said. ""On pricing...We have to be competitive in the market.""To achieve ""healthy, steady"" growth which is less vulnerable to market fluctuations, Engel said BMW and its dealers need to broaden revenue streams from businesses including auto-financing, used-car sales and after-sales services.

448,"   By James B. Kelleher | CHICAGO  CHICAGO U.S. Steel is stockpiling extra iron ore ahead of what could be another record-long freeze-up of the Great Lakes. General Motors has built up inventories of critical parts at its plants and established a supply chain ""crisis room"" that will swing into action in the event of a major winter storm. Con-way Freight is issuing strap-on cleats to its drivers and dock workers.The blast of unseasonably frosty air gripping much of the United States has served as a reminder of the polar vortex that sent a chill through the U.S. manufacturing sector last winter, causing part shortages and plant closures and triggering a 2.1 percent drop in first-quarter gross domestic product. Manufacturers and their suppliers are scrambling to avoid a costly repeat if this frigid autumn morphs into Polar Vortex II. Companies are stockpiling parts at factories, increasing the amount of goods in transit, reviewing weather contingencies with their freight carriers and booking extra trucks and trailers so shipments do not get sidelined by nasty storms.The precautions will add hundreds of millions of dollars in cost, supply chain experts estimate, and could temporarily depress the sector's profits. But Whirlpool (WHR.N), General Motors (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Con-way CNW.N, and other companies contacted by Reuters said they aimed to avoid the even more costly disruptions, like those that hit in early 2014.  “It’s an insurance policy,” said Chad Moutray, the chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.Companies such as U.S. Steel (X.N) believe they have little choice. The country's No. 2 steel producer is moving a key raw material, iron pellets, south and increasing the volume of semi-finished product at steel works around the country. Last winter, locks on the Great Lakes froze for 145 days, more than double the usual 62, and at one point in March more than 90 percent of the lakes' surface was under ice. That stranded raw materials and cut production and shipments of flat-rolled steel alone by 344,000 tons during the first quarter, a six percent drop compared with the same period of 2013, according to U.S. Steel.WINTER FLOAT CEO Mario Longhi says the Pittsburgh-based company is  “definitely preparing operations for a longer period of shutdown of the locks” this winter, which “will consume an additional level of cash.”  Freezing weather forced Ford to idle several facilities last winter just as the company was kicking off the biggest year of new model launches in its history.This year, Ford has added what company planners call a “winter float"" to its just-in-time production plans. The approach puts extra parts in transit and allows additional time for the parts to arrive at plants.GM has identified high-risk regions, in terms of supplier locations and logistics routes, and is monitoring them round the clock from a crisis center for any weather-related disruptions. It has also added extra snow removal equipment at its distribution centers.Whirlpool, meanwhile, is talking to non-rival consumer goods companies about sharing space on delivery trucks in the event of a weather emergency. The company is also investigating short-term trailer rentals in case of winter capacity disruptions.The efforts come as some leading meteorologists are predicting another icy and disruptive winter.  The Commodity Weather Group, which sells forecasts to farmers, believes this winter could be even colder than last year. Forecasters at AccuWeather and National Weather Service, though less worried about a broad repeat, are predicting below-average temperatures and heavy snowfall in the south-central and southeastern states, home to many auto assembly plants.That region was especially hard hit last year. When two inches of snow fell in Atlanta in late January, thousands of drivers abandoned their vehicles, gridlocking area roads for days.Kurt Kuehn, the chief financial officer of Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc, says weather will be a wild card, threatening traffic snarls during the company's peak season.""It’s very hard to move goods if highways are clogged."" Con-way Freight is changing the fuel mix in its on-site storage tanks, after last year's cold snaps made diesel fuel in some locations so thick it would not pump. The company, which delivers parts for the automotive, heavy manufacturing and chemical sectors, also is issuing cleats to drivers and dock workers, so they will not fall in icy conditions. ""We learned a lot of lessons from last year’s polar vortex,” says Gary Frantz, a company spokesman.

450,"  DETROIT Ford Motor Co said on Friday its 2015 F-150 aluminum-intensive pickup truck, the most important model in its latest lineup, will get 5 to 29 percent better fuel economy than its previous versions.Ford made a heavy investment in changing the F-150 to a lighter, truck from one primarily made of steel. In some versions, the new trucks are as much as 700 pounds lighter than the versions they are replacing.Raj Nair, Ford's vice president for product development, said that ""sometime this decade"" the automaker will introduce a hybrid version of the F-150.An F-150 with an ""EcoBoost"" 3.5-liter engine and two-wheel drive will get fuel economy of 24 miles per gallon on the highway, 17 MPG in city driving and 20 MPG combined, Ford said.The General Motors Co Chevrolet Silverado 5.3-liter V8 gets 23 MPG on the highway, 16 MPG in city driving and 19 MPG combined. Ford expanded its lineup of its ""EcoBoost"" engines, which allow it to use turbocharging to get more power with fewer cylinders. Ford is now offering a F-150 pickup truck with a 2.7-liter EcoBoost engine, which gets 27 miles per gallon on the highway, 20 mpg in city driving and 22 mpg combined.The Chrysler LLC Group's Ram 1500 3-liter V6 with a diesel engine, which it called EcoDiesel, gets 28 mpg on the highway, 20 mpg in city driving and a combined 23 mpg. Chrysler is a unit of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.  Ford said it sent this week the first shipments of the 2015 F-150 from its primary truck plant in Dearborn, Michigan, and will get to U.S. dealers in the coming weeks. This is in line with Ford's previous statements that the F-150 would go on sale in December.The first sale to a consumer will happen next week, Ford said. It will take several months before the new truck's sales hit full stride. Production of the new F-150 will begin at Ford's plant near Kansas City, Missouri in the first quarter, the company has said.The F-150 has been the top-selling vehicle in North America since the 1970s.

453,"  * Visteon to sign final deal for sale next month - reports* Halla Visteon shrs dive 15 pct on dividend, Ford link fears-analysts   (Add analyst comments, background)By Hyunjoo JinSEOUL, Nov 24 U.S. automotive parts maker Visteon Corp has signed a preliminary deal to sell its controlling stake in South Korea's Halla Visteon Climate Control Corp to a local private equity firm for $3.6 billion, Korean media reports said.The reports sent Halla Visteon shares tumbling as much as the daily limit of 15 percent on Monday on worries that the new owners may not maintain its current dividend payout, and that a deal could weaken ties between it and key customer Ford Motor Co , which used to own Visteon, analysts said. The Korea Economic Daily said on Monday Visteon plans to sign a final deal to sell its 69.99 percent stake in Halla Visteon to Hahn & Company next month, without citing the source of the information. The deal value was estimated at around 4 trillion won ($3.6 billion), the report said.Other media reports also mentioned the deal. Officials at Visteon, Halla Visteon and Hahn & Company declined to comment.In 2011, Visteon was under pressure from hedge fund investors to split its businesses, as they looked to take profits home after rescuing the U.S. parts maker from bankruptcy following the global financial crisis. Visteon said in May this year that it would sell most of its automotive interiors business to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP as it focuses on its fast-growing climate control and electronics operations.South Korea's Hyundai Motor Group is also a major customer to Halla Visteon.Halla Visteon, which makes heating and cooling systems for vehicles, was founded as a joint venture between Ford and Mando Corp in 1986, but Mando sold its stake to Visteon as the South Korean company struggled with the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s.

457,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. factory activity moderated in November, but sustained gains in new orders and a rebound in exports suggested the economy remained on a firmer footing despite slowing global growth. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said on Monday its index of national factory activity fell to 58.7 last month as the pace of restocking slowed. The index had touched a 3-1/2-year high of 59 in October.A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the nation's  manufacturing sector.""The world economy may be faltering, but that is not stopping the U.S. economy from improving,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  A separate report from financial data firm Markit showed its  U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers index fell to a 10-month low of 54.8 in November from a reading of 55.9 in October. But  this survey has a short history, making it a less reliable gauge of U.S. manufacturing activity. Other reports showed manufacturing growth across Asia and Europe easing in November. There had been concerns that weak global demand was undercutting U.S. manufacturing after data last week showed a second straight month of declines in planned business spending on equipment in October. U.S. stocks were trading lower on concerns about the global economy. Consumer stocks also were pressured due to disappointing in-store retail sales for the Thanksgiving weekend, traditionally a major shopping period. Prices for shorter-dated U.S. Treasury debt slipped and the dollar fell against a basket of currencies.The ISM survey showed new orders increased to their highest level since August, while export order growth also accelerated.Survey respondents reported ""substantial"" order intake for machinery, which they said had resulted in ""a very healthy backlog."" Furniture manufacturers said business continued to be ""stronger than last year."" ""There is no sign that the stronger dollar and/or the weakness seen globally is negatively impacting manufacturing in the U.S.,"" said Michelle Girard, chief economist at RBS in Stamford, Connecticut.While a measure of factory employment ebbed a bit in November, it remained consistent with solid job growth. Electrical equipment, appliances and components manufacturers said they continued to hire people. They also noted that people were leaving to take other jobs.Falling commodity prices, especially crude oil, saw a gauge of prices paid by factories falling to its lowest level since July 2012.""This price dynamic is a positive for corporate profits and  signals lower inflation pressures in the economy,"" said John Silvia, chief economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

For November, Ford's sales rose 2 percent to 20,067, and GM Canada's sales rose 10 percent to 19,264.DesRosiers said Canadian light vehicles sales rose 4 percent to 138,694 in November. The news came as the top six automakers reported better than expected U.S. November sales, helped by generous discounts and low fuel prices.At Chrysler, Jeep brand sales jumped 44 percent from a year earlier, to 5,887 units, and the company sold 6,699 Ram Pickups, up from 5,626 a year earlier. At GM Canada, Buick sales jumped 15 percent and Cadillac recorded its best November sales since 1980, boosted by the ATS sedan and Escalade.Toyota Motor Corp's Canadian sales fell 4 percent, but the company said it has already set a new full-year record for truck sales, boosted by the RAV4 sport utility vehicle. Truck sales rose 8 percent to 6,823.Honda Canada's combined Honda-Acura sales rose 6 percent to a November record of 14,544 vehicles and the company said the Honda Civic remains the best-selling car in Canada.(Reporting by Allison Martell.

459,"  (Updates with final auto sales figures)* Construction spending rises 1.1 percent in October* September outlays point to upward revision to Q3 growth* November auto sales pace exceeds expectationsBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, Dec 2 U.S. construction spending recorded its largest gain in five months in October, easing concerns of a sharp slowdown in fourth-quarter economic growth.The growth outlook also got a boost from strong automobile sales in November.""The economy is on firmer ground than people think, it remains a beacon of light in a world where growth in many countries remains subpar,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. Construction spending rose 1.1 percent, the biggest advance since May, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.September's construction outlays were revised up to show only a 0.1 percent drop instead of the previously reported 0.4 percent fall. Economists said that suggested the gross domestic product estimate for the third quarter could be raised by 0.2 percentage point to a 4.1 percent annual rate.The government will publish revisions to third-quarter GDP growth data later this month. Spending on residential and nonresidential structures such as factories and power stations previously was reported to have made no contribution to growth. GROWTH ESTIMATES RAISED ""We see third-quarter GDP growth being revised up, with most of the upside in business investment in structures,"" said Ted Wieseman, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.Economists, who had expected construction spending to rise only 0.6 percent in October, also raised their fourth-quarter growth estimates, which now range between a 1.7 percent and 3.0 percent rate. Separately, auto sales raced to an annual rate of about  17.1 million units in November, the best pace for that month since 2003 and well ahead of analysts' estimates for a rise to a rate of 16.7 million units.General Motors Co, Chrysler Group, Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co all reported year-to-year sales gains in November, while Ford Motor Co  and Nissan Motor Co Ltd had modest declines.The upbeat construction and auto sales data indicate some momentum in the economy after weak durable goods orders data last week stoked fears of a sharp moderation in the pace of fourth-quarter growth.In October, private construction spending increased 0.6 percent, with outlays on residential projects posting their biggest rise since December of last year.Residential spending was boosted by increases in both single and multi-family homes as well as renovations.Spending on public construction projects increased 2.3 percent in October as federal government outlays recorded their largest gain in eight years. State and local government investment snapped two straight months of declines.

467,"  SYDNEY The aluminum market is showing signs of severe stress as one investor has scooped up the majority of available cash metal, roiling prices and stoking supply concerns amid a revival in demand from the automotive and construction sectors.Traders wanting to roll over contracts must pay London Metal Exchange prices that are close to two-year peaks and the cost could spike further as record premiums, the charge to obtain physical metal, encourage traders to hoard.The cost of rolling a short cash position for delivery tomorrow or the next day has soared above $7 per contract for the four trading days since a dominant warrant holder appeared on Nov. 26 as short holders raced to cover their positions.On Monday, it was as high as $10, its loftiest since December 2012.The spread between spot and three-month prices has swung in and out of backwardation in recent months, meaning cash is more expensive than later-dated contracts. It is a rare price structure for the so-called tom-next spread, reflecting mounting concerns about immediate availability.""With year-end liquidity factors also starting to come into play, there may well be scope for another bout of tightness as we head toward the end of the month,"" said analyst Leon Westgate at Standard Bank.LME data <0#LME-WHT> released on Wednesday but referring to Monday's positions showed that a single participant was holding 50-80 percent of available aluminum stocks on the LME, which handles the bulk of trade in the metal.The LME does not identify investors holding positions and traders had no clear idea who the investor was. But data showed that the firm doing the buying bulked up its position above the 50 percent threshold last Wednesday. LME rules limit the profit a speculator can make by hoarding  much supply on any day that traders with short positions are unable to cover them at the close.Any party holding a position worth over half of LME available stocks must supply metal to short-position holders at very modest price premiums.""It's certainly a signal that things are looking a little bit better on the economic front,"" said strategist Daniel Hynes of ANZ in Sydney. Hynes said aluminum was benefiting from a broad-based pick-up in demand from the auto sector and non-residential construction. U.S. auto sales hit an annualized rate of about 17.1 million units in November, the best pace for that month since 2003.Supply has been hard to get. Stock built up in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis has been tied up in financing deals or in logjams at warehouses, now the subject of litigation in the United States. Financing deals made possible by cheap money after the crisis have locked millions of tonnes of aluminum away from the market. In such deals, a bank or trader buys aluminum, simultaneously selling it forward at a profit, having locked in costs such as rent, insurance and financing.""On a fundamental level, I suppose you just have to dismiss it as the stocks are there, but they're just tightly held,"" said a broker in Hong Kong.    Some 4.3 million tonnes of aluminum is held in LME sheds and a similar volume is estimated to be held outside exchange sheds where rent is cheaper. Much of this will be hedged through short positions on the LME. LME open interest data shows short aluminum positions for December stand at 1.22 million to 2.32 million tonnes, compared with 1.02 million to 1.55 million in long position.Ballooning costs to hold metal mean some may choose to forgo juicy premiums - benchmark in Asia is at $420 on top of cash LME - and deliver metal to LME warehouses instead, putting a brake on rising premiums just as producers and users are set to agree Asian benchmark terms for the first quarter of next year. Traders said they expected only a small $10-$20 increase in term premiums for the first quarter, with negotiations expected to conclude as soon as Friday. <BASE/ASIA2> (Reporting by Melanie Burton in Sydney; Additional reporting by Josephine Mason in New York; Editing by Alan Raybould and David Gregorio)",2014-12-04,F,"Wed Dec 3, 2014 | 8:11pm EST",Aluminum futures market under stress from December supply shock,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-aluminum-futures-idUSKCN0JH0VI20141204?type=companyNews

Chief Technology Officer Raj Nair said Ford put a lot of effort into finding out what customers wanted, including drawing on 22,000 consumer comments.Citing smartphone ownership of 80 percent by Ford customers, Nair said Sync 3 will ""perform more like today's smartphones and tablets but with specific details to make it appropriate for travel."" It will also ""seamlessly integrate"" with Apple Inc's  Siri virtual-assistant capability for iPhone users. Getting connectivity right is important for all automakers at a time when problems with infotainment systems are often the biggest complaint about new vehicles, according to Consumer Reports.Ford said it has turned the corner on customer satisfaction on the current version of Sync, which was introduced in January 2007.Nair said Sync 3 was the most heavily researched program in Ford's history. The new version was developed over 18 months, and includes a simplified layout, larger fonts and bigger finger touch zones. The development budget was undisclosed. IHS Automotive analyst Mark Boyadjis said the current MyFord Touch system still carries the stigma of early consumer complaints and said Ford was smart to drop the name for  upcoming models. Calling Sync 3 a likely success, he said it will help that bad history fade.The third generation of Ford's connectivity system will begin to appear in new cars and trucks in North America next fall for model year 2016 and be available across its North American lineup by the end of 2016 for the 2017 model year.Pricing will be similar on Sync 3 to the current version, which costs just under $1,000.Ford will offer the new system in Europe and Asia, but has not announced the timing.

472,"   By Laurence Frost and Costas Pitas | PARIS/LONDON  PARIS/LONDON Aston Martin is preparing to raise funds to expand its range of models into new areas including crossover SUVs, two sources with knowledge of the matter said, as the loss-making sports car maker steps up its turnaround efforts under a new boss.The British high-end marque is working on plans to issue new shares or bonds and extend its current recovery strategy by three years to 2020, the sources said, adding that luxury sedans and hybrid models also featured in its plans.""It's an expansion from the current model range,"" one said, speaking anonymously because the matter isn't public.Aston Martin, James Bond's carmaker of choice, is the underdog in a British luxury auto industry dominated by Tata-owned (TAMO.NS) Jaguar Land Rover, its next-door neighbour in the otherwise quiet Warwickshire village of Gaydon.Held back by its ageing models and weak investment, the company has missed out on a luxury car boom that saw the global market almost double in five years. Last year it delivered 4,200 cars, far short of a pre-financial crisis peak of 7,300 in 2007. Aston Martin is examining debt- or equity-raising options to finance a bigger plan, the sources said. Further cash will be freed up by more efficient management of working capital such as vehicle and parts inventory.The fundraising would generate 100-150 million pounds ($156-$234 million), with any new shares offered to current investors, said one of the sources, close to the strategy discussions.Aston Martin and its main private-equity backers, Kuwait's Investment Dar and Italy's Investindustrial, declined to comment. Bondholder Waddell & Reed did not return calls.Milan-based Investindustrial and the Kuwaitis together control 93 percent of Aston Martin, acquired in successive capital raisings since Ford (F.N) sold the company in 2007.A further 5 percent is held by Daimler (DAIGn.DE), underpinning a partnership struck last year for the German firm to supply Mercedes engines and technology to Aston Martin. Aston has already begun updating existing models under a 500 million pound investment strategy drawn up in 2012, when Investindustrial paid 150 million pounds for a 37.5 percent stake. That plan sees a replacement for the 120,000 pound DB9 in late 2016 and a return to profitability the following year.At a lavish party in London last week, new Chief Executive Andy Palmer unveiled a DB10 concept car that will feature in the next Bond film, ""Spectre"", and may offer design clues about future production models.""It will come as no surprise when I say that the year ahead is going to be busy across the board,"" Palmer told guests.ROUGH YEAR  Aston may be happy to see the back of 2014, which began with the recall of 17,590 cars to address defective accelerator pedals. More recently, it won an exemption from safety rules that threatened U.S. sales of the coupe and convertible versions of its DB9 and Vantage models. However, Palmer's room for manoeuvre remains limited by 410 million pounds of existing debt, maturing in July 2018. Weak credit ratings inflated financing costs to 26.9 million pounds last year, when Aston recorded a 16.7 million net loss.The company is paying out 10.25 percent annually on the latest $165 million bond issue in March, whose CCC+ rating from Standard & Poor's was closer to default than investment grade.The upgraded strategy will be announced at the Geneva auto show in March, the sources said.Sales of the new models will add to Aston's recovery goal of 7,500 deliveries for the core sports cars, bringing the overall target closer to 10,000, one source said. The push faces toughening competition, with Maserati and Bentley (VOWG_p.DE) already moving into SUVs. Besides the Maserati expansion, Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) has said Ferrari's annual production cap of 7,000 vehicles should increase.""The super-premium market is about to get pretty crowded, and the cost of competing there is high,"" said London-based Exane analyst Stuart Pearson.Success or failure may hang on ""how much Aston can draw on the partnership with Daimler and leverage its research and development,"" he said.Palmer, who filled a CEO vacancy that had been open since Ulrich Bez's retirement last year, has already hinted at grander plans for the four-door Taraf sedan launched in the Middle East in limited volumes this year under the revived Lagonda brand.Daimler has also said it could share SUV architecture with Aston, a message broadly reiterated by CEO Dieter Zetsche after Palmer's September appointment. The two men became well acquainted as Daimler increased development and manufacturing cooperation with Nissan (7201.T), where Palmer, 51, served as CEO Carlos Ghosn's second-ranked lieutenant until his defection. Within his first six weeks in Gaydon, Palmer hired former Nissan marketing chief Simon Sproule and, in a clear sign of intent, created positions for three vehicle programme chiefs within a new planning department.

477,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. manufacturing output recorded its largest increase in nine months in November as production expanded across the board, pointing to underlying strength in the economy.Factory production rose 1.1 percent after advancing 0.4 percent in October, the Federal Reserve said on Monday.""There is little evidence here that weaker global growth or a stronger dollar has hurt U.S. manufacturing,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.The upbeat factory data joined bullish employment and retail sales reports in suggesting strength in the economy, even as growth in the fourth quarter is expected to moderate sharply after two back-to-back quarters of robust expansion.Wall Street had expected manufacturing output to rise only 0.5 percent in November. The U.S. remains a bright spot in a troubled global economy, where growth has slowed in China and the euro zone. Japan has slipped back into recession. But optimism over U.S. manufacturing was tempered somewhat by a New York Federal Reserve report showing its Empire State general business conditions index contracted in December for the first time since January 2013. Economists, however, cautioned against reading too much into the weak report, noting the survey was volatile because of limited factory activity in New York state. ""With all the discussion about the impact of lower oil prices, it may feel like this miss is a warning that the factory sector is retrenching,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at  Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. ""We are not convinced is what the numbers are telling us.""A third report showed homebuilder sentiment ebbed in December, though builders remained more optimistic than in the first half of the year. BROAD GAINS  The reports came a day before Federal Reserve officials gather for a two-day meeting to assess the economy's health and deliberate on monetary policy.Economists expect the U.S. central bank to open the door a bit wider to interest rate hikes next year after the recent run of bullish data.U.S. financial markets were little moved by the mixed data as investors kept a wary eye on oil prices, which hit fresh 5-1/2 year lows. Manufacturing output in November was led by a 5.1 percent jump in automobile production after three straight months of decline. There were also solid gains in machinery, apparel and leather, and petroleum and coal products. Mining output slipped 0.1 percent. Utilities production jumped 5.1 percent as a cold snap boosted demand for utilities, prompting forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers to raise its fourth-quarter growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 2.6 percent annual rate. Strong manufacturing and utilities output combined to lift  overall industrial production by 1.3 percent in November, the largest increase since May 2010. The amount of manufacturing capacity in use last month rose to its highest since December 2007. Overall industrial capacity use hit its highest level in more than 6-1/2 years.""This could be seen as an indication of accelerating resource slack absorption in the U.S. economy,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.Officials at the Fed tend to look at capacity use as a signal of how much ""slack"" remains in the economy and how much room there is for growth to run before it becomes inflationary.

A reading above 50 signals expansion in economic activity.The December output subindex fell to 54.7, also the lowest since January, from last month's 55.6 final reading. The employment subindex dipped to 52.8 from 55.1. It was the lowest since July but also the 18th straight month of readings indicating growth in jobs.""Softer output and employment numbers merely represent a cooling in the pace of expansion from unusually strong rates earlier in the year,"" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, in a statement. He said, however, the data ""also send a warning light to policymakers that the fourth quarter is likely to see a weakening in the pace of economic growth.""Markit's ""flash"" reading is based on replies from about 85 percent of the U.S. manufacturers surveyed.

484,"  GENK, Belgium Ford Motor Company (F.N) produced the last car at its plant in Genk, Belgium, on Thursday, closing the site which produced some 14 million vehicles over the past 50 years.The company decided in late 2012 to shut the factory which employed some 4,000 people and to relocate production of new models to Valencia, Spain.""It seems so unreal. I think I'll only notice after the holidays. It's winter time, you're at home and have no idea what to do. That's when it will hit,"" said 60-year-old Rudi Beys on his way to one of his final shifts, adding he felt too young to retire.According to a study carried out by the nearby University of Hasselt, the closure of the plant will cost some 11,800 jobs in the greater region, as suppliers to Ford also have to make cuts. The final car to roll off the production line on Thursday was set to be a white Galaxy van, which will be emblazoned with the signatures of factory staff and will be donated to a charity.

The company decided in late 2012 to shut the factory which employed some 4,000 people and to relocate production of new models to Valencia, Spain.""It seems so unreal. I think I'll only notice after the holidays. It's winter time, you're at home and have no idea what to do. That's when it will hit,"" said 60-year-old Rudi Beys on his way to one of his final shifts, adding he felt too young to retire. According to a study carried out by the nearby University of Hasselt, the closure of the plant will cost some 11,800 jobs in the greater region, as suppliers to Ford also have to make cuts. The final car to roll off the production line on Thursday was set to be a white Galaxy van, which will be emblazoned with the signatures of factory staff and will be donated to a charity.After the final shift ended at 1400 CET (1300 GMT), the company will keep a few hundred of its staff over the coming months to dismantle assembly lines.Following the Genk closure and that of an Opel factory in Antwerp in 2010, Belgium now just has two vehicle assembly plants: Audi in Brussels and Volvo Cars in Ghent.

488,"  (Adds Toyota results; analyst comment)By Allison MartellTORONTO Jan 5 Major automakers reported their best ever Canadian sales performance last year, with Ford Motor Co holding on to the top sales spot for 2014, despite a late surge by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's Canadian unit.Chrysler Canada sold 21,613 cars and trucks in December, 40 percent more than a year earlier and wrapped up the best unit sales year in its 90-year history. Chrysler's sales beat Ford's in October and November.Even so, Ford was the country's top-selling automaker for the fifth straight year. Its sales jumped 40 percent to 22,640 for December and rose 3 percent to 291,951 for the full year. Chrysler's 2014 sales increased 12 percent to 290,004. ""The battle for best-selling vehicle company remained tight all year,"" DesRosiers Automotive Consultants said in a note to clients. ""Ford moved into the number one position in September and didn't look back.""DesRosiers said the 1.85 million vehicles sold in Canada topped the previous record from 2013 by more than 100,000.The news came as automakers reported strong U.S. sales for December, boosted by falling gasoline prices, but executives cautioned that growth could slow in 2015 after five years of recovery from the recession. General Motors Co's Canadian unit sold 13 percent more vehicles in December than a year earlier, and full-year sales rose 6.3 percent to take third spot.Toyota Motor Corp's Canadian unit was fourth, up 2.8 percent at 200,851. In December, it barely improved on a year ago, notching truck sales gains that offset a slip in car sales. Seven manufacturers - Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, Toyota, Honda Motor Co Ltd, Hyundai Motor Co  and Nissan Motor Co Ltd - sold more than 100,000 vehicles in Canada in 2014.GM Canada sold 19,247 vehicles in December and 249,800 over the full year. Car sales jumped 22.9 percent in December, and truck sales rose 9.1 percent. The full-year sales gains were more evenly split, with a 6.5 percent increase for cars and 6.2 percent for trucks.Sales of Ford's popular F-Series pickup trucks rose 37 percent for December as the 2015 F-150 went on sale. Trucks made up nearly 80 percent of Ford's Canadian sales in 2014.Chrysler's full-year results benefited in part from the Jeep Cherokee SUV, whose sales rose more than 600 percent from 2013. The key model started shipping in October 2013, replacing the discontinued Liberty. Overall, Jeep sales rose more than 50 percent.

489,"  (Adds total U.S. industry sales for full year, BMW ranking as No. 1 luxury brand in U.S., other details)By Bernie Woodall and Ben KlaymanDETROIT Jan 5 Automakers reported strong December U.S. sales on Monday, boosted by falling gasoline prices, but industry executives and analysts cautioned that growth would slow in 2015 after five years of rapid recovery from the recession.General Motors Co easily beat analysts' expectations, logging a 19 percent gain to 274,483 vehicles, the best December for the No. 1 U.S. automaker in seven years. Ford Motor Co's   December sales of 220,671 were up just 1.2 percent, missing expectations.""U.S. auto sales are dancing to a very different (and we believe unsustainable) beat,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note.He suggested U.S. auto demand has outpaced economic, wage and housing growth rates, thanks largely to easy credit access for consumers.Even as the pace of sales growth is expected to slow this year, modest growth to the 16.7 million to 17 million vehicles seen by analysts is still encouraging, several company executives have recently said. Any deceleration in U.S. growth could be damaging at a time when other global markets are slowing. On Monday, Jeff Bracken, head of Toyota Motor Corp's  Lexus brand in the United States, said of 2015, ""Any way you slice it, whether it's 16.7 (million vehicles) or slightly below or above, it's still a very healthy industry.""Toyota executives said they conservatively expect 2015 sales of 16.7 million vehicles, while others, including LMC Automotive, expect this year's sales to hit 17 million.In December, sales of pickup trucks and large SUVs surged, spurred by low gasoline prices.Sales of GM pickup trucks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra surged 35 percent to 81,273, outpacing the F-Series pickups from Ford, which were flat at 74,355 vehicles. Ford's F-150 pickup truck sales remain limited due to the rollout of a new version. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles'  Ram Truck brand pickup sales soared 32 percent to 44,222 vehicles.Auto sales are an early indicator each month of consumer spending. Sales in December rose almost 11 percent to more than 1.5 million vehicles, according to research firm Autodata, finishing in line with analysts' expectations.U.S. average gasoline prices are 34 percent lower than a year ago, and in much of the country are less than $2 per gallon. Full-year sales for 2014 finished just above 16.5 million vehicles, matching the tally in 2006. Rising demand has allowed automakers to boost prices for their vehicles, however.Kelley Blue Book, an industry source for vehicle valuations, said Monday the average transaction price for a new vehicle sold in the U.S. market in December was a record $34,367, up 2.5 percent from a year ago.GM's December transaction prices grew 4 percent from a year earlier to $38,816, KBB said.Fiat Chrysler's U.S. sales jumped 20 percent in December on strong Jeep SUV and pickup truck sales, but still missed analysts' expectations. FCA's sales of 193,261 for the month were the highest since 2006 for the company once known as Chrysler.Nissan Motor Co said on Monday its December U.S. sales grew 7 percent, stronger than expected, while Honda Motor Co's 1.5 percent increase fell short of expectations.In addition, Germany's BMW reclaimed the U.S. luxury crown last year, topping Daimler's Mercedes brand by more than 9,000 vehicles.

493,"  (Adds union crowd estimate, comment from Ford)By Brad HaynesSAO PAULO Jan 12 Thousands of Brazilian metalworkers marched on a highway outside of Sao Paulo on Monday to protest layoffs by carmakers, adding to a mounting crisis in a politically sensitive industry.State police said about 7,000 workers from Volkswagen AG , Ford Motor Co and the Mercedes-Benz truck unit of Germany's Daimler AG occupied a lane of the highway linking Brazil's biggest city and biggest port.The union organizing the protest estimated that total participation was close to 30,000, based on the number of workers at three auto plants shut down for the march. Last week Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz confirmed more than 1,000 job cuts, accelerating a drop in auto industry payrolls that dwindled nearly 9 percent last year.VW and Mercedes workers have already responded with strikes and the participation of Ford employees bolstered labor leaders' assertion that the resistance to layoffs will be industrywide.Auto industry groups in Brazil are forecasting little or no recovery from a sharp downturn in 2014, as rising interest rates and expiring tax breaks contribute to weak consumer confidence. Carmakers have responded by cutting costs, ending an agreement with Brazil's government to avoid layoffs. The labor standoff is testing the mettle of President Dilma Rousseff's new economic team, which took charge this month promising to end the cheap credit and tax incentives that have propped up key industries but wrecked government accounts.The auto industry contributes a quarter of Brazil's industrial production and its powerful labor unions helped to found the ruling Worker's Party. A Mercedes-Benz representative confirmed its workers were involved in the demonstration, adding that the company recognized their right to protest. She said production at its local truck factory was stopped for the day.Volkswagen reiterated a recent statement that the company urgently needs to reduce costs at its local plant, known as Anchieta. Workers there have halted production since Tuesday.Ford representatives confirmed a one-day stoppage at the company's factory outside of Sao Paulo as workers participated in the demonstration in what they described as an act of ""solidarity.""Unlike many major automakers in Brazil, Ford has not announced substantial layoffs in response to the downturn.

494,"   By Ben Klayman | DETROIT  DETROIT General Motors Co on Monday will unveil its next-generation Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid and is expected to restate a commitment to build an affordable long-range electric car, doubling down in a segment with scant sales and even skimpier profits.Electric cars and plug-ins like the Volt account for less than 1 percent of the global vehicle market, and falling oil prices are widening the cost gap between electrified cars and petroleum-fueled internal combustion engine vehicles. GM's current Volt has sold well below initial company projections and is a money loser, analysts say. The company doesn't disclose profits by model line. Last year, U.S. sales of the Volt fell almost 19 percent to fewer than 19,000 vehicles.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne last May asked consumers to steer clear of his company’s Fiat 500e.""I hope you don't buy it because every time I sell one it costs me $14,000,"" he said.Still, GM and its major rivals persist in their efforts because without “zero-emission” vehicles and ultra-high mileage hybrids, they could fall short of meeting government demands to more than double fuel efficiency by 2025. In addition, California has set its own quotas for zero-emission vehicle sales, and China is pushing the industry for more battery-powered vehicles.“We’re in for the long haul,” GM CEO Mary Barra told reporters last week at the company’s downtown Detroit headquarters. “I’m very excited about the new Volt.” The new Volt, which will be unveiled ahead of the Detroit auto show this week, will offer customers an electric driving range of 50 miles, up from about 40 in the current model. Steve Marjoros, director of Chevy car marketing, said GM will spend more to market the new car, which will launch in the second half of the year, and emphasize a fun-to-drive message more.Barra’s predecessor, Dan Akerson, said in 2013 that he thought GM could cut Volt’s price - currently $34,345 - by up to $10,000 while making the car profitable. GM did not say how much the new Volt will cost. Forecaster LMC Automotive expects U.S. sales of EVs and plug-in hybrids to almost triple to more than 339,000 in 2020 from last year. But that's still fewer sales - from dozens of competing battery-powered models - than Toyota Motor Corp realizes in a year from sales of its Camry or Ford Motor Co from its F-150 pickup truck. Barclays only sees the global share of such vehicles hitting about 3 percent by the end of the decade. “The driver at this point would be more regulatory push than consumer pull,” Barclays analyst Brian Johnson said.GM also plans to offer a new EV called the Chevy Bolt that would include a 200-mile electric driving range, something Akerson said in 2013 might “radically change the calculus” for EVs.GM will get competition from Tesla Motors Inc, which is building a $5 billion electric battery plant in Nevada to meet what it expects will be heavy demand for its Model S sedan and for its forthcoming Model X SUV and Model 3 sedan that will be sold for about $35,000.German luxury car maker BMW, has spent almost $3 billion to develop its i-Series of electric cars. The company has hinted at the scope of its plans by getting trademarks to number i9 for the series. Nissan Motor Co, maker of the all-electric Leaf, is the leading seller of mass-market electric cars, and CEO Carlos Ghosn has stood by his bet on battery-electric vehicles, even with gas prices falling. The Leaf, however, can travel only 84 miles between charges, according to government ratings. That distance is too short for many U.S. drivers.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas doesn’t see EVs becoming anything more than a “rounding error” in the market, especially with low gasoline prices. He sees the vehicles as more goodwill PR than money maker.“It’s just science lab stuff now,” Jonas said. “It’s not really for immediate commercial benefit.”He believes that EVs will only succeed as fun-to-drive luxury vehicles, something that bodes well for BMW and Tesla’s higher-end models. More mainstream models like the Volt and Leaf, and even Tesla’s $35,000 car have less potential.

495,"   By Paul Lienert  While General Motors Co's Chevrolet on Monday pulled the wraps off a tiny, environmentally friendly electric car called the Bolt, rival Ford Motor Co was showing off a 400-plus-horsepower pickup truck better suited to burning rubber than hauling hay.The new F-150 Raptor has racing shock absorbers, a 10-speed transmission and the word FORD splayed across the grill. A few steps away, Nissan Motor Co touted its redesigned Titan pickup, which will be equipped this fall with a brawny Cummins V8 diesel rated at 310 horsepower and 555 pound-feet of torque.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is scheduled on Tuesday to reveal updated versions of its popular Ram 1500 truck, far and away the company's best-selling U.S. vehicle.  Cheap gas is rekindling American consumers’ love affair with big trucks, and automakers are eagerly expanding their truck lineups to squeeze more money out of one of the most profitable segments anywhere in the global auto industry.""Follow the money,"" said Kelley Blue Book analyst Matt DeLorenzo, who said the Detroit show is focused this year on ""those vehicles that are hot in the market with large margins.""And there are no hotter, higher-margin models than pickups, which fueled much of the growth in U.S. vehicle sales last year. Three of the four top-selling models in 2014 were full-size trucks: Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado and Ram 1500.Pickups drive profits at the Detroit Three, accounting for 90 percent and more of global pretax margins at GM, Ford and Chrysler, according to analysts. Easy credit allows many buyers to buy higher-end trucks with more features, which in turn has goosed average transaction prices well above $40,000.""That's where the money is going - into F-150 Titaniums,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. ""Who buys a big Cadillac any more over a four-door pickup?""AMBITIOUS REDESIGNS  The redesigned F-150 Raptor is still at least 18 months away from showrooms, but Ford is eager to promote the truck’s  lighter body – the new model sheds 500 pounds compared to the old one – and new technology. The new Raptor swaps the old model’s monster V8 for a smaller, more efficient yet more powerful EcoBoost V6.The 2014 Raptor is one of Detroit's most expensive full-size pickups, topping out at just under $50,000. The 2017 model that's on view at the Detroit show goes on sale in fall 2016, likely with an even higher sticker price.Nissan has big ambitions for its redesigned 2016 Titan, which was largely designed and engineered, and will be built in the United States.	Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn told Reuters the new Titan should be able to capture about 5% of the pickup segment, or more than 100,000 vehicles a year after its introduction, up from sales of fewer than 13,000 Titans in 2014. Nissan has borrowed some moves from the Detroit truckmakers, offering the Titan in three cab configurations and five trim levels, as well as a choice of three engines, including gas and diesel V8s and a V6.As big pickups get larger, pricier and more luxurious, some manufacturers also see opportunity in a long-dormant sector: mid-size trucks.That label is relative. GM's new mid-size Chevrolet Colorado Crew Cab is actually seven inches longer than the ""full-size"" 2005 Silverado standard cab of 10 years ago.GM’s recently launched Colorado and GMC Canyon are  challenging Toyota Motor Corp's dominance in the mid-size truck market, where the Tacoma has been one of the last survivors.Toyota answered GM Monday at the Detroit show, unveiling a redesigned 2016 Tacoma, which was designed and developed in the U.S., and will be built in Texas and Mexico. Prices will start at about $21,000.A surprise entry at the Detroit show is the Santa Cruz ""crossover truck"" concept from Korean automaker Hyundai Motor Co, which currently does not sell pickups in North America.

The U.S. carmaker will raise output of its Fiesta hatchback at Cologne, its main European plant, by 300 vehicles a day starting in February to 1,850.Six extra shifts will be added at Cologne on weekends during the first two months of 2015 to underpin the move, Ford said.

Ford will also increase production of the Focus, C-Max and Grand C-Max models assembled at a plant in Saarlouis by 240 vehicles per day from next week to 1,770, it said.EU car sales may keep growing this year by as much as 5 percent after a 5.7 percent increase in 2014, Hanover-based NordLB analyst Frank Schwope said, citing demand from Germany, France and Italy.Ford, which is incurring losses in Europe, cut production of the Fiesta at Cologne during the final quarter of 2014 when it applied for subsidies under the German government's ""Kurzarbeit"" short-work program, affecting about 4,000 of the plant's 17,300 employees.

501,"   By Bernie Woodall  Ford Motor Co (F.N) said on Friday it was taking a charge related to its Venezuelan operations that will cut fourth-quarter net profit by $700 million, as companies scramble to shield their bottom lines from the country's volatile currency.    For more than a year Ford has said its ability to get auto parts for its operations in Venezuela have been hampered by the valuation of the Venezuelan bolivar, and made the accounting change effective Dec. 31.The move will cause a one-time pre-tax special item charge in the quarter of $800 million. Still, Ford said its estimate for 2014 full-year pre-tax profit was unchanged at about $6 billion. Ford's announcement came on the same day that Kimberly-Clark Corp said it took a $462 million charge in the quarter due to changes in the Venezuelan exchange rate. General Motors Co (GM.N), Clorox (CLX.N), Procter & Gamble (PG.N), Baker Hughes (BHI.N) and Brink's (BCO.N) have also taken hits to their respective bottom lines in the past year because of the bolivar. The accounting change ""does not have an impact on Ford's Venezuelan operations or ownership,"" Ford said. Ford shares fell 0.8 percent to $14.91, in line with session's move by the Dow Jones industrial average.      Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday shook up complex currency controls in the socialist-run country, where a dollar can fetch more than 180 bolivars on the black market instead of the country's three-tiered exchange rate system that has ranged from 6.3 bolivars to about 50 bolivars to the dollar. Beginning with the first quarter of this year, Venezuela will become the only wholly owned Ford unit that will not include operating results in financial results, Ford said. Instead, the company said it ""will record cash and recognize income"" of its Venezuelan operations.The $800 million charge is an accounting change and does not include any losses in Venezuela which will be reported as part of the company's South American business next Thursday, a Ford spokeswoman said. Ford said its Venezuela operations had a cash balance at the end of 2014 of about $500 million, compared with about $765 million at end-2013.Citi analyst Itay Michaeli called the move a ""modest positive"" because it eliminates the foreign exchange volatility that undercut Ford's 2014 results. Michaeli also speculated whether rival General Motors Co (GM.N) would make a similar move, saying it could curb the company's exposure to the volatile Venezuelan market and currency.Ford did not disclose sales and production figures in Venezuela, which are small compared to sales in Brazil and Argentina.Auto sales in Venezuela fell 76 percent in 2014 to 23,707 vehicles, and the country's auto production fell 72.5 percent to 19,759 vehicles, a national automakers organization said last week.

On Thursday, however, it backed away from that forecast, saying the loss would narrow from $1 billion in 2014 but would be wider than previously thought.""We're seeing a much bigger impact from Russia,"" Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said.The company's earnings beat Wall Street's expectations but fell from the prior year, mainly due to charges for a previously announced accounting change for its Venezuela operations. Ford also maintained its 2015 profit forecast.Shanks said the introduction of the latest version of Ford's F-150 pickup truck was going ""extremely well"" in North America, where 2014 pretax earnings of $6.9 billion were greater than the overall profit of $6.3 billion. The truck is the major force behind Ford's earnings. The profit margin in North America was 8.4 percent last year. Ford had said last fall that figure would finish at the low end of a range of 8 percent to 9 percent.In the fourth quarter, Ford's pretax profit fell in North America and Asia.Ford's loss in Europe was $443 million, compared with $529 million a year earlier. Net income was $52 million, or 1 cent per share, a decline from $3.07 billion a year earlier, when results were boosted by a one-time $2.1 billion special tax item.    This year, Ford took a one-time charge of $800 million in the fourth quarter for an accounting change in Venezuela that also shields its future earnings from the volatile currency and operations there.Excluding special items, earnings were 26 cents per share, 3 cents higher than the expectations of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue of $35.9 billion topped analysts' estimates of $34.54 billion. In North America, Ford made a pretax profit of $6.9 billion in 2014, which will yield an annual bonus for about 50,000 union-represented workers of $6,900 per person, down from $8,800 in 2013.

Just four months ago, Ford told investors it would lose $250 million in Europe in 2015. It lost money in the region last year despite boosting revenue by $2.2 billion and selling more cars than the previous year. Ford lost $121 million in Russia in the fourth quarter.Ford's troubles in Europe stand out because rivals General Motors Co (GM.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI) are gaining traction in a market that has been down since the global recession.FCA this week posted its first quarterly profit in Europe since 2007, in part because it has no major investments in the stumbling Russian market. GM affirmed its forecast for a profitable European auto business next year.""Obviously, the situation in Russia is going to continue to impact us and will be a drag on our earnings for a period of time,"" Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said Thursday. FCA CEO Sergio Marchionne said Wednesday he expects a profitable year for its European operations. He steered clear of big investments in Russia earlier in this decade when rivals were jumping in.""Europe remains a big question mark that's going to overhang both Ford and GM for the foreseeable future,"" John Brager, senior credit analyst with Hermes Investment Management, said in London on Thursday.In North America, Ford's 2014 profit margins fell to 8.4 percent from 10.2 percent the previous year. In the fourth quarter, North American margins were 7.4 percent, down from 8.2 percent a year before, in large part because of an expensive remaking and launch of an aluminum body F-150 pickup truck, company executives said. The F-series truck line drives Ford's performance in North America, the region that in 2014 contributed $6.9 billion in pretax profit, more than the company's total pretax profit after losses elsewhere. Ford told investors last fall that North American margins this year would range from 8 to 9 percent, down from more than 9 percent on average from 2010 to 2013. Ford executives warned that consumers may not pay the full costs of technology to cut greenhouse gas emissions because gasoline is cheap. Gasoline prices have fallen sharply since then.

""We would like to invest in production facilities so we are waiting,"" Masuko added.

512,"  FRANKFURT The finance chief of Ford Motor Co (F.N) expects ongoing problems in Russia where the decline of the rouble and the struggling economy was weighing on its market share, according to German newspaper Handelsblatt.Russia's currency and economic woes were cited last week by Ford as major reasons the company lowered expectations for its European business in 2015. Other carmakers have incurred losses and closed production plants in Russia for the same reason.  ""2015 does not look good,"" Ford's Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks was quoted as saying about Russia in an interview to be published on Monday. Shanks told the financial daily that Ford has lost market share in Russia as ""a number of competitors have aggressively cut their prices.""Japanese car makers were able to cut prices on the back of the weak yen and Korean car makers had followed, he said. Shanks said that Ford was looking at measures to cope with the Russian crisis. ""All options are on the table,"" he was quoted as saying.A market exit was not an option, Shank said. Ford spokespeople in Europe could not immediately be reached for comment outside office hours.Ford had previously estimated losses from Europe at about $250 million in 2015. On Thursday, however, it backed away from that forecast, saying the loss would narrow from $1 billion in 2014 but would be wider than previously thought. General Motors Co (GM.N) said last week it will suspend production at its St. Petersburg auto assembly plant in Russia from mid-March to mid-May and is raising prices for its products because of the weak and volatile Russian rouble.In addition, Volkswagen AG's (VOWG_p.DE) labor chief said on Thursday the company lost hundreds of millions of euros in Russia because of the decline of the rouble.

514,"  (Repeating to additional subscribers)By Tim McLaughlinFeb 2 At least 40 major U.S. companies have substantial exposure to Venezuela's deepening economic crisis, and could collectively be forced to take billions of dollars of write downs, a Reuters analysis shows.The companies, all members of the S&P 500, and including some of the biggest names in Corporate America such as autos giant General Motors and drug maker Merck & Co Inc , together carry at least $11 billion of monetary assets in the Venezuelan currency, the bolivar, on their books.The official rate is at 6.3 bolivars to the dollar and there are two other rates in the government system - known as SICAD 1 and SICAD 2 - at about 12 and 50. The black market rate, though, was at about 190 bolivars to the dollar on Sunday, according to the website dolartoday.com.The problem is that the dollar value of the assets as disclosed in many of the companies' accounts is based on either the rates at 6.3 or 12 and only a limited number of transactions are allowed at those rates. The assets would be worth a lot fewer dollars at the 50 rate in the government system and the dollar value would almost be wiped out at the black market rate.The currency system is also about to be shaken up following an announcement by Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro on Jan. 21, leading to fears of a further devaluation.American companies will also have additional exposure to the bolivar that isn't disclosed because they don't see the size of that exposure as material to their results. The Reuters analysis also doesn't look at the thousands of publicly traded and private American companies that aren't in the S&P 500 and will in some cases have bolivar assets.BLACK MARKET RATE  Some leading American companies have already decided that the stronger exchange rates - the official rate at 6.3 and the SICAD 1 exchange market at 12 - are not reflective of the currency conditions they face in the South American country.Diaper and tissue maker Kimberly-Clark Corp recently announced a charge of $462 million for its Venezuelan business, leading to a fourth-quarter loss for the company, after it concluded that the appropriate exchange rate was the SICAD 2 exchange rate at 50 rather than the 6.3 it had previously used.Using the stronger exchange rates is unrealistic because of how hard it is to repatriate profits earned in Venezuela back to the United States at any rate, let alone those rates, securities analysts say. Citigroup Inc says it has not been able to buy U.S. dollars from the Venezuelan government since 2008.Companies can seek dollars at the official rate if they are using those dollars to import raw materials for production of priority goods such as food and medicine, and some can buy dollars at the SICAD 1 rate at around 12 bolivars to the dollar through auctions that are typically held several times per month but are only targeted at specific sectors. As tumbling oil prices have left Venezuela with fewer dollars, its currency board has steadily reduced approval for repatriation of dividends at the official rate - leaving companies with growing quantities of bolivars trapped by currency controls.""It's a huge deal and companies will get hit big,"" said Ali Dibadji, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co Inc. ""Take a look at what Kimberly-Clark did last week and what Clorox did a few months ago by getting out of Venezuela.""Cleaning and household products maker Clorox last year decided to exit Venezuela altogether. Its CEO Don Knauss said at the time: ""We saw no hope that we could create a sustaining business in that country."" The currency issues are hurting many U.S. companies much more than their sales might suggest. Many of the companies in the analysis have been getting between 1-3 percent of their global revenue from Venezuela.Ford Motor Co and oil services company Schlumberger NV   took big-ticket hits to their quarterly profits because of their Venezuelan operations. Ford took a fourth-quarter charge of $800 million and Schlumberger $472 million.A Ford spokeswoman said that it still values its Venezuela assets at about 12 bolivars per US dollar. But for Ford, the currency system and other conditions are so tough in the South American country that it has made an accounting change that will allow it to ring fence its Venezuela business so that it doesn't have a direct impact on the company's operating results.Schlumberger, which previously used the 6.3 rate, said it is now using the SICAD 2 rate of 50 as it ""best represents the economics of Schlumberger's business activity in Venezuela.""Another S&P 500 company to switch to the 50 rate from 6.3 in recent weeks was industrial gases producer Praxair Inc, which took a fourth-quarter charge of $131 million as a result. It also said the switch will hurt its revenue and earnings in 2015. ANOTHER DEVALUATION? Those changes don't reflect the prospect of another currency devaluation in Venezuela, as recently telegraphed by Maduro, who is struggling to keep a lid on consumer prices amid a 64 percent inflation rate and a plunge in oil revenue. The official rate was last devalued by 32 percent to the current 6.3 from 4.3 in February 2013, at that time the fifth devaluation in a decade.Maduro said in the Jan 21 announcement he would merge the two existing SICAD rates (the ones at 12 and 50 per U.S. dollar). He also would introduce another new rate to offer dollars via private brokers to vie with the black market rate. There has yet to be a further announcement providing details of the new system and the rates.Currency uncertainties aside, foreign companies face a myriad of other problems in Venezuela, from weak demand to shortages of many goods, difficulty in importing parts and products, and relying on the government to approve price increases to keep pace with hyperinflation.Most of the S&P 500 bolivar exposure is concentrated among 10 companies that have disclosed about $7.3 billion in assets linked to the country's currency system, according to the Reuters analysis of their latest quarterly financial statements.But if those companies used Venezuela's SICAD 2 currency rate, the one at about 50 bolivars to the dollar, their assets would decline by as much as $5.8 billion. All of these companies currently either use the rates at 6.3 and 12.It would be far worse if they used Venezuela's black market rate of about 190 for the currency. The companies' bolivar assets would be worth only a tiny fraction of their current estimated value if they used that rate.GM, which ranked No. 1 out of the group analyzed, with $1.5 billion in Venezuela exposure, said it is closely monitoring conditions there. ""We have nothing to announce at this time,"" spokesman Tom Henderson said.Some U.S. companies, such as Merck, justify valuing their Venezuela assets at the most preferential rate because they are providing essential services and goods, like medicine, to the country. They report some success in translating bolivars into dollars at the 6.3 rate. Merck did not respond to a message seeking comment.Still, some of these same companies have prepared their investors for a currency hit in their latest round of quarterly disclosures. PepsiCo Inc said it would take an after-tax charge of up to $440 million if it revalued its Venezuela assets at the 50 rate. As of early September, the company disclosed $505 million in bolivar-denominated net monetary assets.""I do think that more companies may consider exiting Venezuela if the inability to remove cash or take prices to offset devaluations persist,"" said Dibadji, the Sanford Bernstein analyst.

517,"   By Paul Lienert | DETROIT  DETROIT January U.S. car sales by the three Detroit-based automakers topped analysts' expectations, as low gasoline prices and easy credit terms helped fuel sales of utility vehicles and big pickups.Full-size trucks and SUVs are among the industry's most profitable vehicles. But some companies were having trouble supplying dealers with enough of those high-margin models in January.Sales of trucks and SUVs accounted for 69 percent of January sales at General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI), compared with 66 percent a year ago, according to a Reuters analysis.GM said on Tuesday that January sales rose 18 percent to 202,786 vehicles, while Ford said sales were up 15 percent to 178,351. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected 201,436 and 173,431, respectively.Fiat Chrysler's U.S. arm said January sales rose 14 percent to 145,007 vehicles, against analysts' expectations of 144,476.""As the price of gasoline goes down, people want to buy bigger vehicles that go faster,"" said Mike Jackson, chief executive officer of AutoNation Inc (AN.N). ""That's just human nature."" Ford sold a record 54,370 F-series pickups in January and said the redesigned 2015 F-150 remained in short supply, particularly high-end versions including the King Ranch and Platinum editions.GM said combined sales of its full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups were up 22 percent to 48,727. Sales of the automaker's new mid-size Colorado and Canyon pickups totaled 8,147.At Fiat Chrysler, Jeep sales climbed 23 percent and Ram trucks rose 21 percent. January sales topped expectations at Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T), but lagged at Honda Motor Co (7267.T).Toyota sales of 169,194 were up 16 percent, including record sales by its premium Lexus brand.Sales at Nissan jumped 15 percent to 104,107. Nissan's performance was driven in part by strong results of its Rogue, Pathfinder and Murano utility vehicles, as well as its Versa, Sentra and Altima sedans. Honda said record January sales of 102,184 were up 12 percent from a year ago, narrowly missing analysts' expectations. Sales of the Civic and Accord were down, but the best-selling CR-V crossover jumped 22 percent.Chrysler's U.S. industry sales in January were projected at an annual rate of 17.0 million, including about 300,000 medium and heavy trucks.A Reuters survey of 47 analysts estimated an annual rate of 16.6 million, which does not include the larger trucks.

521,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it is adding 1,550 workers at four plants to build the new aluminum body F-150 pickup truck.The company also said that for the first time it is promoting union-represented workers from the lower entry-level wage to the pay veteran plant workers make. Between 300 and 500 workers will have been promoted by the end of the first quarter, Ford said.In 2007, the United Auto Workers union and the three major U.S. automakers including Ford agreed that new hires would be paid at a rate less than veteran UAW workers. This was done to allow the U.S. automakers to be more competitive with foreign automakers with U.S. assembly plants.The union and Ford agreed that 20 percent of its plant workers could be entry-level, also called second-tier, employees, with exemptions for a parts plant and an axle plant near Detroit, and for new work ""in-sourced"" to Ford because of the lower labor costs. By January, Ford had exceeded the 20-percent level.Of the 1,550 jobs, 900 are allocated for Ford's truck plant in Kansas City and the rest at three stamping, auto parts and axle plants near Detroit.Ford did not say how many of the jobs are being added because of the brisk initial sales of the new F-150, which went on sale several months ago. In January, the new aluminum-bodied F-150 accounted for 18 percent of overall F-150 retail sales.

522,"  (Adds details on promotions, F-150 jobs)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT Feb 4 Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it is adding 1,550 workers at four plants to build the new aluminum body F-150 pickup truck.The company also said that for the first time it is promoting union-represented workers from the lower entry-level wage to the pay veteran plant workers make. Between 300 and 500 workers will have been promoted by the end of the first quarter, Ford said.In 2007, the United Auto Workers union and the three major U.S. automakers including Ford agreed that new hires would be paid at a rate less than veteran UAW workers. This was done to allow the U.S. automakers to be more competitive with foreign automakers with U.S. assembly plants. The union and Ford agreed that 20 percent of its plant workers could be entry-level, also called second-tier, employees, with exemptions for a parts plant and an axle plant near Detroit, and for new work ""in-sourced"" to Ford because of the lower labor costs.By January, Ford had exceeded the 20-percent level. Of the 1,550 jobs, 900 are allocated for Ford's truck plant in Kansas City and the rest at three stamping, auto parts and axle plants near Detroit.Ford did not say how many of the jobs are being added because of the brisk initial sales of the new F-150, which went on sale several months ago. In January, the new aluminum-bodied F-150 accounted for 18 percent of overall F-150 retail sales. The F-150 is the primary truck in the F-Series pickup trucks that are the top-selling vehicles in North America and are also key profit makers for the company.The new workers will be paid the entry-level, also called second-tier, wage of $15.78 per hour, and under current contract terms, will receive 5 percent wage increases per year until they reach $19.28 per hour.The workers promoted to a higher employment status were hired in 2010 and have been receiving $19.28.

524,"   By Sonya Dowsett and Joe White | MADRID/DETROIT  MADRID/DETROIT U.S. car manufacturer Ford (F.N) announced on Thursday the final part of a 2.3 billion euro ($2.6 billion) expansion of its operations in Spain, in what it called the biggest ever investment in the country's auto industry.The investment consists of an initial 1.1 billion euros announced in 2011, followed by another 1.2 billion euros since 2013, Ford said. The investment in the Spanish plant continues a trend of auto production moving south in Europe, where wages tend to be lower. Ford closed a factory in Belgium last year as part of a restructuring of its loss-making European operations.Just as Mexico has a thriving motor industry making vehicles for much of the Americas, its Spanish counterpart is prospering by keeping labor costs down and targeting markets abroad. Around 80 percent of the Ford plant's production is for export. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy visited the Ford plant in the eastern region of Valencia on Thursday and said the auto industry had played a key part in the recuperation of the Spanish economy. The European Commission has sharply increased its forecasts for Spanish economic growth this year.The investments will allow Ford to build six different model lines, up from four currently, and expand exports to markets outside of Europe, including shipments of Transit Connect compact vans to the United States, a company spokesman said.   Once the expansions are complete, the Valencia plant will have capacity to build 450,000 vehicles a year. That will make Valencia one of the two largest assembly operations in Ford's global manufacturing system, along with the automaker's factory in Chongqing, China.Ford employs around 8,000 people at the facility, the company said, up from just below 5,000 in early 2013. Spain's car industry, including auto parts manufacturers which spring up around factories to supply production lines, created 26,800 jobs in 2014, according to Spanish car producers' association ANFAC.  With Spanish unemployment at 24 percent, unions keen to protect jobs have accepted flexible work practices and salary freezes, which together with close links to a world-class domestic car parts industry have helped attract the orders.

534,"   By Allison Martell and Euan Rocha | TORONTO  TORONTO Feb 17 A strong Canadian dollar has wounded the country's auto manufacturing sector over the last decade, but the currency's recent drop to a near six-year low is unlikely to spur a rush of new investment, say senior industry executives.Canada has struggled in recent years to win new investment from automakers, losing out to both the United States and lower-cost Mexico. While some major automakers have announced new investments in Canada in recent months, they are expected to preserve jobs rather than significantly increase employment.Reid Bigland, chief executive of Fiat Chrysler's  Canada arm, said the currency was not a major factor in the company's recent plan to invest some $2 billion to build its next generation minivan in Windsor, Ontario, as the choice was made before Canadian dollar's recent slide.""Under normal circumstances, when it comes to Canadian manufacturing, when the Canadian dollar goes down it's really an opportunity to strike up the band,"" Bigland told Reuters on the sidelines of the Canadian International Auto Show in Toronto. ""Unfortunately the (Canadian) dollar has been strong for so long that a lot of the band has left.""In 2014, car makers announced over $10 billion in investments in the United States, some $7 billion in Mexico, and only about $750 million in Canada, according to the Center for Automotive Research. Bigland said Chrysler has lost local suppliers to the strong Canadian dollar, to the point where only 25 to 30 percent of those serving its Windsor operation are Canadian. He noted that in the last few years, Canada has also lost former Caterpillar, Daimler, Ford and Navistar plants, among others.In 2013 the Canadian Automotive Partnership Council, an industry group, looked at challenges facing the industry. Exchange rates made the first page of their report.""Canadian auto assembly labor costs have been reduced significantly in own-currency terms in recent years,"" they wrote. ""But the appreciation of the Canadian dollar has more than offset those savings when expressed in U.S. dollar terms."" 'PERMANENT PRICE' But Bigland said the weakening currency's impact would be more limited ""for the simple reason that there aren't as many Canadian manufacturers around as there were 10 years ago."" Even union economist Jim Stanford, who sees the weaker currency enhancing the business case for investment in Canada, said the damage done when the Canadian dollar appreciated will not be fully or automatically repaired by its recent weakness.""There's going to be a permanent price to pay,"" said Stanford, who is with Unifor, a union representing Canadian employees at Chrysler, Ford Motor Co and General Motors  as well as parts suppliers.Executives at other automakers such as GM and Honda Motor Co Ltd, which have also outlined new investments in their Canadian facilities, say there are numerous factors on top of  currency movements that go into their investment plans. They include labor and benefit costs, logistics and infrastructure, taxation and government subsidies.""We don't believe making a strategy, or a business strategy based on exchange rates is sound business logic,"" Jerry Chenkin, CEO of Honda Canada, said in a phone interview, adding that the currency's move was not a driver in Honda's plan to invest C$857 million ($692.47 million) in its Allison, Ontario operation.

538,"   By Bernie Woodall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK United Auto Workers President Dennis Williams told Reuters it would be an ""injustice"" if workers at the Detroit Three automakers don’t get a raise in contracts this year, but he said the union must also ensure the companies remain competitive.Williams, in an interview on Thursday with the Reuters editorial board in New York, gave a glimpse of the union’s approach to this summer’s contract talks with General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.The union wants to sharply narrow the roughly $12-an-hour gap in pay between newly hired and veteran workers, and secure the first increase in hourly base wages for veteran workers in about a decade.Williams left the door open to various ways to address the pay issue, including more variable pay linked to profits. The UAW and the automakers have a lot at stake in this new round of talks. The companies will be punished by investors if they are seen as striking uncompetitive deals in the wake of their near-death just six years ago. Williams must balance the wishes of his members for a big raise, and his concern for the automakers’ long-term viability.The UAW has not conducted a substantial strike against any of the Detroit automakers since the 1990s, and was prohibited from striking GM and Chrysler under the terms of the 2009 federal bailout. This time around, Williams said the union is prepared to call for walkouts, if necessary. Other U.S. unions, including workers at oil refineries and West Coast ports, have been emboldened by the strengthening economy to stage strikes or slowdowns as leverage in contract talks. “We’re ... mature organizations that have been through a hell of a lot together to survive,” Williams said. “None of us want to blow it.”    Williams, 61, became the head of the richest U.S. union last June, and has said he will serve only a single four-year term.   A former U.S. Marine he got his start on the factory floor at farm equipment make J.I. Case in Rock Island, Ill. “I'm just a welder,” Williams said, before launching into an  analysis of corporate balance sheets and the impact of automation on factory workers. Williams serves on the board of commercial truck maker Navistar International Corp, an appointment he says he took reluctantly, reflecting traditional union concerns about getting too close to management. Williams says his views have changed, and he now supports UAW representation on boards. The union has a representative on GM’s board.     The U.S. government bailouts of GM and Chrysler and Ford’s self-funded restructuring have put the UAW in an unusual position. As GM’s largest shareholder, and a significant beneficiary of the bailouts, the UAW has a political and institutional stake in promoting the long-term health of the companies. It is still GM’s largest shareholder through its retiree healthcare trusts.But the UAW is also under pressure to get the most for its members, especially at a time when more of them, including thousands of auto workers in Michigan, live in “right to work” states where paying union dues is voluntary.The hottest issue in this year’s contract talks will be the two-tier pay system that the UAW agreed to in 2007 as the Detroit Three skidded toward crisis.  Veteran workers make just over $28 per hour, with slight variations at the three automakers, while entry-level workers make $15.78 to start. Annual raises bring them to a cap of $19.28 per hour.As the U.S. auto market has rebounded since 2009, the Detroit Three have increased the number of hourly jobs by 20 percent to 136,350 UAW workers – growth the companies and analysts attribute in part to reduced UAW labor costs.But there are significant differences in how the two-tier wage policy operates at each of the three U.S. automakers. Ford recently overtook GM in the number of UAW-represented workers for the first time since the 1930s, and about 28 percent of Ford's 50,700 UAW-represented workers earn the lower base wage rate. GM has 49,900 UAW-represented workers, and slightly less than 20 percent are in the second tier. But at Fiat Chrysler, 42 percent of the company’s 35,720 UAW workers are paid at the entry rate.“We’ve got to be creative,” Williams said, referring to any overhaul of the two-tier wage system. “Wages are not the only way to stay competitive. It’s about productivity. It’s about engineering, it’s about a lot of things.” (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)",2015-02-20,F,"Fri Feb 20, 2015 | 12:00pm EST","UAW chief: Raise worker pay, keep companies competitive",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-autos-uaw-idUSKBN0LO1IK20150220?type=companyNews

540,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 25 German automaker Daimler AG  plans to offset higher costs for technology to cut carbon dioxide emissions with material cost savings for at least the next several years, Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber said on Wednesday.The cost of fuel-efficiency technology is a challenge for big automakers, particularly as tumbling energy prices encourage consumers to buy larger, less-efficient models.Ford Motor Co has warned investors that U.S. consumers may not pay the full costs of technology to cut greenhouse gas emissions because gasoline is cheap. ""Already in 2014, we could offset the burdens in variable cost for all these CO2-related measures with material cost efficiencies,"" Uebber told reporters in New York. ""I think so it will be the same in '15 and '16 and '17.""A key source of cost reduction for the maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury vehicles is creating more commonality among its different car lines, which would allow Daimler to negotiate higher volume with fewer suppliers. For example, the new Mercedes E-Class shares components with the C-Class, Uebber said.""You have higher volume because you share now components between the C and E and you are talking with the supplier about the whole volume,"" Uebber said. ""That of course gives you leverage and gives you possibilities to decrease your material cost base."" Daimler's flagship Mercedes-Benz division posted a 14.5 percent sales increase in Europe in January. Uebber said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" about rebounding market growth for the continent but warned that one month's results were ""not a confirmation.""While the overall U.S. market has eclipsed sales from 2008, Western Europe remains about 15 percent lower than levels from that year, the company said.January sales added up to ""a nice number in Europe,"" Uebber said. ""If it goes further in the next five months, I'm happy, and maybe the low fuel price will support it.""

543,"  (Adds final sales totals, comments by auto executive and analyst)By Paul Lienert and Ben KlaymanDETROIT, March 3 For the second year in a row, ferocious winter weather slowed U.S. vehicle sales in February, causing the major automakers to miss analysts' bullish projections.Six of the top seven manufacturers on Tuesday reported year-to-year sales increases in February, but all fell short of expectations.""Mother Nature was just not nice to us,"" said Fred Diaz, U.S. chief for the Nissan brand. He expects the industry to recoup lost sales as the weather improves.Total U.S. sales in February rose 5.3 percent to 1,257,619 vehicles, according to research firm Autodata. Analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected an increase of 7.1 percent.The industry finished with an annualized sales rate in February of 16.23 million vehicles, far below the 16.7 million that economists polled by Thomson Reuters had expected. Most companies blamed extreme weather conditions in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest, and some pointed to a spike in fuel prices toward the end of the month.""There was definitely a slowdown"" in sales after February 20,"" said Mark LaNeve, Ford Motor Co's U.S. sales vice president. LaNeve said Ford's fleet sales fell, while retail sales were flat.John Krafcik, president of research firm TrueCar, said the extreme weather likely had a greater impact on sales of cars than trucks.General Motors Co said U.S. February sales climbed 4 percent from a year ago to 231,378 cars and trucks, while Ford's sales dropped 2 percent to 180,383. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles   posted an increase of 6 percent to 163,586 vehicles. Toyota Motor Corp said sales were up 13 percent to 180,467 cars and trucks. Nissan Motor Co's sales were up 3 percent to 118,436 vehicles, and Honda Motor Co  reported an increase of 5 percent to 105,466.Tempering analysts' bullish expectations for car sales, U.S. consumer sentiment fell from an 11-year high in February, weighed down by the unusually severe winter, according to a monthly survey released on Friday by the University of Michigan.Despite the weakening of sentiment, ""my clients aren't holding their hand over the panic button,"" said Mark Wakefield, managing director at AlixPartners. The average vehicle transaction price in February fell slightly from a month ago to $33,299, according to industry researcher Kelley Blue Book, but the average price is still $1,145 higher than a year ago.Average per-vehicle incentive spending by carmakers remained steady at $2,623, according to TrueCar.Domestic luxury brands took a beating in February, with GM's Cadillac down 13 percent and Ford's Lincoln off 7 percent.Continued low fuel prices dented sales of electrified vehicles, with the Chevrolet Volt hybrid sliding 43 percent, the Ford C-Max hybrid off 26 percent and the Nissan Leaf down 16 percent.Sales of small cars and family sedans slid last month, while big trucks continued to show strength. GM's full-size Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups were up 24 percent and 6 percent, respectively.The two GM trucks outsold Ford's F-series pickup, which is ramping up to full production and had a modest decline of 1 percent.

551,"  (Adds days for UAW bargaining convention)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT, March 23 General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co have much higher labor costs than their cross-town rival Fiat Chrysler, according to a new study released just ahead of a meeting of United Auto Workers officials as they prepare for contract talks with the Detroit Three.GM's U.S. auto workers on average earn about 21 percent more in wages and benefits than their counterparts at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , reflecting the much higher percentage of lower-paid, entry-level workers at FCA, according to a study of 2014 labor costs by the Center for Automotive Research (CAR).Ford Motor Co's hourly labor costs were $57, just behind GM's at $58. FCA's U.S. workers averaged $48 per hour. The two-tiered pay scale implemented as part of the United Auto Workers 2007 labor agreement allows GM, Fiat Chrysler and Ford to pay their newer ""entry-level"" workers less than veteran ones. UAW leaders have said that narrowing the gap between new hires and veterans will be a top issue when negotiations begin with the Detroit automakers this summer.The UAW leadership hears from the union's local leaders on Tuesday and Wednesday at a convention hall in Detroit. Germany's Daimler AG, for its Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama, its only U.S. plant, has the highest U.S. auto labor costs, at an average of $65 an hour. Workers at the U.S. plants of Volkswagen AG and BMW earn the least, at $38 and $39 per hour, respectively, according to estimates by CAR.GM, Ford and Fiat Chrysler are the only automakers in the CAR report whose U.S. workers are represented by the UAW. Despite major restructuring since the 2009 recession, GM and Ford still have higher labor costs than their major competitors. The $10 per hour labor cost gap between GM and Toyota Motor Corp  translates to roughly $250 a car in additional labor costs for GM, according to data in the report.Some 43 percent of Fiat Chrysler's U.S. auto workers earn the lower entry-level wage, almost double the percentage of such workers at Ford and GM.Among other automakers operating in the United States, Honda Motor Co workers earned on average $49 per hour, Toyota Motor Corp $48, Nissan Motor Co $42, Hyundai Motor Co and its corporate stablemate Kia Motors Corp $41.Per hour labor cost averages include pay for ""temporary"" workers who are formally employed by outside agencies such as Kelly Services Inc but mainly work full-time alongside workers employed directly by the automakers. Japanese automakers have the highest percentages of temporary workers, which cut labor costs, CAR analysts have said.

554,"   By Andrew Chung  A U.S. jury has found that Ford Motor Co did not infringe four patents owned by a Washington state company in its onboard computer systems, clearing the No. 2 U.S. automaker in a $240 million lawsuit, Ford said on Friday. The jury in federal court in Tacoma, Washington, also found in Ford's favor on its claim that the patents' owner, Eagle Harbor Holdings, stole Ford's trade secrets, according to Ford.The jury verdict was not publicly available on the court's docket on Friday. The trial, which began on March 10, involved four patents on inventions Eagle Harbor Holdings said Ford used without permission in technology the carmaker has introduced in its vehicles in recent years, such as the Sync dashboard communication system and its assisted parking controls. Eagle Harbor Holdings was seeking at least $240 million in damages. The company, based on an island in Puget Sound, sued Ford in 2011. It was founded by inventor Dan Preston, who, with his son Joseph, previously developed technology that was used for General Motors Co's OnStar communications system, according to its website.  Eagle Harbor Holdings said in its complaint that between 2002 and 2008, it communicated details of its technology to both Ford and Volvo - then owned by Ford - but Ford refused to license its patents. Ford countersued, accusing Eagle Harbor of stealing its confidential documents related to Sync in order to obtain its own patents, which it then used to sue Ford or extract licensing fees from the carmaker. Ford's countersuit said Preston initially sought to develop products for in-vehicle communication systems, but later ""abandoned"" the effort and focused on accumulating patents. It alleged Preston obtained Ford's secret documents through an employee of a Ford supplier.""We are pleased with the results of this case and the company will continue to defend itself against meritless claims,"" Ford said in a statement.  A representative for Eagle Harbor could not immediately be reached on Friday. The case is Eagle Harbor Holdings Llc and Mediustech Llc v.

562,"   By Joseph White | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Ford Motor Co (F.N) will resurrect the Lincoln Continental as its top-of-the line luxury sedan, betting the classic name will help rebuild the brand's image in the United States and China. Ford's Lincoln will unveil a prototype of the future Continental sedan on Monday ahead of the April 3-12 New York auto show, which will feature many of the Continental's future rivals, including the Cadillac CT6 sedan from General Motors Co (GM.N), a new Jaguar XF sedan from Jaguar Land Rover and a bevy of super-premium models from Daimler AG’s (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes Benz.Ford retired the Continental name in 2002, and joined its rivals in using letter and number codes for most models. But memories lived on in China, where Continentals had been the car of political leaders and celebrities. China now is the main market for premium sedans such as the Audi A6 or A8, the Mercedes S-class or the BMW 7-series.Ford executives say they were surprised to learn that the Continental name also had legs in the United States, where grandly-proportioned Continentals from the 1960s had prominent cameo roles in movies such as the popular “Matrix” science fiction series. What clinched it, said Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields, was that early designs for the next large Lincoln sedan “weren’t as good as we wanted them to be.” About 18 months ago, Fields said he and other senior executives decided to call the car the Continental based on the positive research.“Immediately, people’s eyes lit up,” Fields said. The show car debuts a new look for Lincoln, with a grille and stance that lean more toward Jaguar or Maserati than Cadillac or BMW. When it launches next year, the production Continental will be the latest salvo in a $2.5 billion renovation of Lincoln. In the United States, the brand lags well behind BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Cadillac and Lexus. Lincoln’s U.S. sales are up 1.2 percent for the first two months of 2015, lagging the 9.2 percent increase in the overall market.By 2020, Ford wants to expand Lincoln sales globally to 300,000 vehicles a year, about triple current sales, Fields said.  Ford is in the early stages of relaunching Lincoln in China, with 11 dealerships and 25 planned by the end of 2015. Ford has not announced plans to build Lincoln vehicles there. GM says it plans to build the CT6 in China and at its factory in Hamtramck, Michigan.

563,"  (Adds VW statement, sales data)SAO PAULO, March 30 Volkswagen AG  has furloughed 4,200 workers at its second largest factory in Brazil for three weeks, a local union said on Monday, as disappearing demand forces carmakers in the country to manage excess capacity.A representative of the metalworkers union of Taubate, about 90 miles (150 kilometers) northeast of Sao Paulo, said the move had stopped production at the plant, which made the top-selling Gol hatchback, the Voyage sedan and the Up city car.VW representatives declined to comment on the situation at the factory, but issued a brief statement saying ""Volkswagen has made use of flexible methods to adjust production volume to the demands of the market.""As exports to Argentina have plunged and demand in Brazil hits its worst downturn in over a decade, VW is cutting a shift at the Taubate plant and sending workers home for three weeks as part of the transition, according to the union official. Just over a year ago, VW announced an investment of 1.2 billion reais ($370 million) at the plant to produce the Up, but the new model has struggled to catch on in a weak market.The Up was the ninth most sold car in Brazil in January and February, selling at about half the pace of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' market-leading Palio. Volkswagen's weak start to the year has seen it slip into third place in Brazil by sales, behind Fiat and now General Motors Co. ""If the Up were selling well, Volkswagen would be suffering a little less. It would dampen the critical situation for the industry this year,"" said automotive market analyst Raphael Galante of Oikonomia Consultants.VW is one of many automakers working to cut costs in Brazil, where sales and output are down over 20 percent in the first two months of 2015. Jobs in the auto industry have fallen 8 percent in the 12 months through February. Workers at a Mercedes-Benz truck factory outside of Sao Paulo voted on Wednesday to stop work for 24 hours in a protest over 244 colleagues who were fired by the heavy truck unit Germany's Daimler AG.Last week, Ford Motor Co struck a deal with workers at a nearby factory to open a voluntary buyout program aimed at reducing the 400 to 600 excess workers at the plant, in the company's estimates, according to a local union spokeswoman.VW's efforts to cut jobs at another plant near Sao Paulo in January triggered a 10-day strike, forcing the company to reverse layoffs of 800 workers and negotiate a new labor deal through 2019.($1 = 3.26 reais)   (Reporting by Alberto Alerigi Jr.; Writing by Brad Haynes; Editing by Christian Plumb, Bernard Orr)",2015-03-30,F,"Mon Mar 30, 2015 | 3:01pm EDT",UPDATE 1-VW halts production for three weeks at Brazil plant - union,http://www.reuters.com//article/volkswagen-brazil-idUSL2N0WW1VV20150330?type=companyNews

It also credited organizing gains in the gaming and auto supplier sectors as well as higher education.

Automakers had one fewer day and one fewer weekend in which to sell than during the year-ago month.Among the strong performers were Toyota Motor Corp, Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and Audi.While dealership traffic began to pick up last month, ""the second quarter looks to be even more favorable"" because of pent-up demand after a harsh winter, according to Eric Lyman, vice president of industry insights for research firm TrueCar Inc. The annualized sales rate rebounded sharply in March, to 17.15 million vehicles, from 16.2 million in February.Last month's sales were driven in part by German and Japanese luxury brands, as well as by a strong appetite for big trucks and SUVs from Detroit manufacturers.Results varied by company, with only three of the top six automakers beating analysts' expectations and only two exceeding their year-earlier sales.Only Toyota managed to do both. Its sales rose 4.9 percent, to 225,959 vehicles. Analysts had expected 223,280. March was a strong month, said Bob Carter, senior vice president of automotive operations at Toyota's U.S. sales arm.

GM was down 2.4 percent, to 249,875, and Honda fell 5.3 percent to 126,293.Domestic luxury vehicle sales were soft in March, with the notable exception of the full-size Lincoln Navigator and Cadillac Escalade sport utility vehicles.Most foreign luxury brands saw year-to-year gains of 1 to 20 percent in March.Ford and Chevrolet amped up the stakes in full-size pickups, with dealers offering discounts of up to $9,000 on 2015 models and $12,000 or more on leftover 2014 models.Despite the hefty price rollbacks, sales of Ford's best-selling F-Series pickup dropped nearly 5 percent in March. At GM, Chevrolet Silverado sales were up 7 percent.Analysts said rising consumer sentiment in March was reflected in higher vehicle transaction prices. TrueCar estimated the average price of a new vehicle in March rose to $32,201, up 2.1 percent from a year earlier.GM shares dipped 2 percent to close at $36.74, and Ford shares slipped 1.4 percent to $15.91.

Automakers had one fewer day and one fewer weekend in which to sell than during the year-ago month.Among the strong performers were Toyota Motor Corp, Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and Audi. While dealership traffic began to pick up last month, ""the second quarter looks to be even more favorable"" because of pent-up demand after a harsh winter, according to Eric Lyman, vice president of industry insights for research firm TrueCar Inc.The annualized sales rate rebounded sharply in March, to 17.15 million vehicles, from 16.2 million in February.Last month's sales were driven in part by German and Japanese luxury brands, as well as by a strong appetite for big trucks and SUVs from Detroit manufacturers.Results varied by company, with only three of the top six automakers beating analysts' expectations and only two exceeding their year-earlier sales. Only Toyota managed to do both. Its sales rose 4.9 percent, to 225,959 vehicles. Analysts had expected 223,280.March was a strong month, said Bob Carter, senior vice president of automotive operations at Toyota's U.S. sales arm.

Health care was the strongest sector in the first quarter, appreciating 6.2 percent. Shares of automakers also declined after reporting March sales. Shares of General Motors were down 2 percent at $36.74 while Ford was down 1.4 percent at $15.91 as sales dipped at both companies.U.S. private employers added the smallest number of workers in more than a year in March and factory activity hit a near two-year low, fresh signs that economic growth slowed significantly in the first quarter.The reports precede Friday's jobs data, the most widely watched indicator of the week, though that arrives on Good Friday when the stock market will be closed. Investors also are anxious ahead of the start of first-quarter earnings, which strategists say could be hurt by the rising dollar's impact on multinational companies. Estimates for first-quarter earnings have fallen sharply since Jan. 1, Thomson Reuters data showed.""People continue to have concerns about earnings weakness and economic weakness,"" said Stephen Massocca, chief investment officer at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 77.94 points, or 0.44 percent, to 17,698.18, the S&P 500 lost 8.2 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,059.69 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 20.66 points, or 0.42 percent, to 4,880.23.

Truck sales rose 11.7 percent. GM said the gain reflected a market shift from cars to trucks and crossovers. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Canadian unit sold 25,060 vehicles, up 1.7 percent from a year earlier. Sales of its Ram truck brand jumped 24 percent, more than offsetting a decline in car sales.""The Ram brand continues to be one of the key determinants in our sales growth,"" Fiat Chrysler Canada Chief Operating Officer Dave Buckingham said in a release. Ram sales rose to 10,008 trucks from 8,075, while car sales slipped 5.5 percent to 3,279 vehicles.Ford Motor Co's Canadian sales fell 4.6 percent to 21,380 vehicles, as car sales dropped 7.9 percent and truck sales fell 3.6 percent. The company said a shortage of inventory for some popular vehicles hurt sales. Toyota Canada sold 16,805 cars and trucks in March, down from 17,397 in March 2013. Sales of Toyota-brand passenger car fell to 6,736 from 7,809.In contrast to Canada, Toyota was a strong performer last month in the United States, where demand for new vehicles rose 0.6 percent to 1.55 million.Honda Canada's sales fell 4 percent to 14,749 vehicles.""Traffic to our Canadian dealer network was below what we would expect in March,"" senior vice president Dave Gardner said in a release.

Ford hasn't said whether or when it will replace the current Taurus in the U.S. In China, Ford will aim the new Taurus at business people and entrepreneurs who want a car with a spacious back seat and a more conservative design, says spokesman Craig von Essen. Ford will assemble the car in Hangzhou, China with local partner Chongqing Changan Automobile (000625.SZ).""Large sedans being sold in China today are luxuries and there is a gap there between luxury brands and popular brands. That's where we're aiming this car at,"" Ford China Chairman and CEO John Lawler told Reuters on the sidelines of the Shanghai show.The Taurus is not going to be a volume leader in China for the Dearborn, Mich. automaker. ""But Ford needs a premium, flagship car like the Taurus ... because in China there is growing demand for such cars from consumers trading up from run-of-the-mill midsize sedans,"" said James Chao, IHS Automotive's Asia-Pacific managing director. For Ford and other large sedan makers, the future looks to be outside the United States. Large sedans account for about 3 percent of the total U.S. car and light truck market, says Ford sales analyst Erich Merkle, down from 12 percent in 2000. Taurus sales in the U.S. slid by more than a fifth last year, and are down nearly 28 percent through the first three months of this year, according to Autodata figures. Ford is betting the Taurus can benefit in China from the legacy of the original 1985 American Taurus - which jolted the U.S. auto business with its aerodynamic styling. Initially derided by rivals, the Taurus proved a hit and pushed General Motors (GM.N) and Chrysler (FCHA.MI) to play catch-up by rounding off the corners of their boxy sedans.For several years in the mid-1990s, the Taurus was the best-selling car in the U.S., before being overhauled in 1997 by Toyota Motor's (7203.T) Camry. Ford's F-series pickups were then, and are still, the best-selling model-line in the U.S.Ford retired the Taurus name in the United States in 2006 as sales declined, but incoming CEO Alan Mulally revived the name a year later.

593,"  (Adds Nissan, Ford exec comments in paras 4 and 7; changes date)By Jake SpringSHANGHAI, April 20 Foreign automakers continue to plough money into factories in China, the world's largest car market, even as the biggest economic slowdown in a quarter of a century crimps sales growth.Market leaders Volkswagen AG and General Motors  show no sign of letting up on their planned investments, while Toyota Motor and Ford Motor are also pursuing new China expansion plans.That's in spite of the economic slowdown  further depressing the car market in January-March, when sales grew only 3.9 percent, compared to 9.2 percent a year ago and way below the 7 percent growth that the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) predicts for this year.""It's still one of the markets with the highest growth in the world so we're not disappointed in this,"" Carlos Ghosn, CEO of both Nissan Motor and Renault, said at the Shanghai autoshow on Monday. ""We are investing in China and we are going to continue investing in China.""Foreign automakers, many of which will unveil new products for China at this week's Shanghai show, including Ford's redesigned Taurus sedan, aren't fretting over the first quarter slowdown. But if the fallout from the broader economic slowdown bleeds into the rest of the year, global automakers may need to reconsider their China expansion plans, said James Chao, Asia chief of IHS Automotive. A handful of foreign automakers are still outperforming the market, with Ford, for example, posting 9 percent sales growth in the first quarter.""We're very conscious that part of what we do is we match demand with supply. We deal with reality, and if the reality tells us to slow down production, we'll slow down production,"" Ford's executive chairman Bill Ford told Reuters on Monday, noting that growth in China was still ""quite robust"".IHS's Chao added the market was still divided into two segments, with domestic manufacturers hovering around 60 percent capacity and the international joint ventures at 80-85 percent.Anthony Lau, Shanghai-based research director for consultancy TNS Sinotrust, said even strong single-digit growth in car sales in China is much better than in markets elsewhere. China accounted for more than half the total industry spending on new or expanded capacity last year, with plant investments worth $12.7 billion, according to an annual Canadian study of automakers' outlays.ADDING CAPACITY  Foreign automakers are likely to hoover up more idle capacity from smaller domestic firms, said Chao at IHS, as Ford did in acquiring a factory from Harbin Hafei Automobile that will add 200,000 vehicle per year capacity when upgrades are finished in 2016.That follows Ford's launch last month of a new factory in eastern China's Hangzhou, with annual capacity for 250,000 vehicles. ID:nS8N0T100V]Even Toyota, whose first-quarter sales slipped 0.1 percent, is ending a years-long expansion freeze, spending $440 million to add a new facility and a third line at a factory in Guangzhou, which could start production in 2017 with capacity to make about 100,000 cars a year.Volkswagen is targeting China capacity of 5 million vehicles a year by 2019, up from 3.5 million in 2014, as part of a 22 billion euro ($23.3 billion) investment push, a company spokeswoman said, and GM has its sights on hitting that 5 million number a year earlier.By the time these expansions come on-line, the years of breakneck double-digit growth will likely be long gone: economists predict 7 percent GDP growth this year and a further notching down to 6.8 percent in 2016.($1 = 0.9432 euros)   (Editing by Norihiko Shirouzu and Ian Geoghegan)",2015-04-20,F,"Mon Apr 20, 2015 | 12:34am EDT",UPDATE 1-Foreign automakers double down on China bets despite slowing growth,http://www.reuters.com//article/autoshow-shanghai-investment-idUSL4N0XH1NA20150420?type=companyNews
594,"  DETROIT Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it will lay off about 700 workers at a Detroit-area plant making compact and compact hybrid cars, responding to a dip in demand for such vehicles amid lower gasoline prices.Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan is cutting a shift and will run on two shifts beginning June 22, said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski.The plant makes three versions of the Ford Focus compact car and the C-Max compact hybrid and C-Max plug-in hybrid car. Sales of hybrid and gasoline-powered small cars have taken a hit in recent months as tumbling crude oil prices sent gasoline prices lower.Focus U.S. sales in March were down 14.5 percent and for the first three months of the year sales of about 53,000 units were up only 2 percent compared with last year's first quarter. C-Max U.S. sales of about 4,300 through March were down 23 percent from last year's first quarter. Ford said it would offer summer replacement jobs to some of the Michigan Assembly workers and work to find all of them full-time employment at the company's plants.

595,"  DETROIT, April 23 Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it will lay off about 700 workers at a Detroit-area plant making compact and compact hybrid cars, responding to a dip in demand for such vehicles amid lower gasoline prices.Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan is cutting a shift and will run on two shifts beginning June 22, said Ford spokeswoman Kristina Adamski.The plant makes three versions of the Ford Focus compact car and the C-Max compact hybrid and C-Max plug-in hybrid car. Sales of hybrid and gasoline-powered small cars have taken a hit in recent months as tumbling crude oil prices sent gasoline prices lower. Focus U.S. sales in March were down 14.5 percent and for the first three months of the year sales of about 53,000 units were up only 2 percent compared with last year's first quarter. C-Max U.S. sales of about 4,300 through March were down 23 percent from last year's first quarter. Ford said it would offer summer replacement jobs to some of the Michigan Assembly workers and work to find all of them full-time employment at the company's plants. Ford said it has ""high confidence"" it can find new jobs for all laid off workers within a year. The layoffs will affect 675 hourly and 25 salaried workers.

""In China, we have to look into this, and we are not decided.""

Geely is expected to start producing a sport-utility vehicle based on CMA underpinnings at the new Luqiao plant towards the end of 2016, but it was not clear when Volvo would start producing its own CMA cars in China.Samuelsson said it was a ""good guess"" that Volvo's first CMA-based car would be a fully-fledged redesign of the Volvo V40 hatchback, since it is the only small car Volvo markets around the world now. He said, however, that Volvo was also interested in using common platform and powertrain technologies with Geely to come up with a small SUV.""SUVs are growing in the world, so that is a good guess that something in that segment will be worth taking a look at,"" Samuelsson told Reuters.

612,"  (Autodata corrected the annualized selling rate to 16.5 million from 16.45 million in 5th paragraph)By Bernie Woodall and Ben KlaymanDETROIT May 1 U.S. auto industry sales in April came in below expectations as Asia's major carmakers' results disappointed, offsetting strong gains for trucks and SUVs made by General Motors and Ford.Sales reported on Friday by Japan's Nissan, Toyota  and Honda, as well as the combined results for South Korea's Hyundai and its Kia  affiliate, all missed expectations. Fiat Chrysler   also disappointed.Industry sales in April finished at 1,454,951 vehicles, up 4.6 percent according to research firm Autodata. That was below the gain of 6 percent analysts had expected as consumer appetite for trucks and SUVs favored the ""Big Three"" Detroit automakers.""When demand for crossovers, SUVs and trucks is strong, the Asian automakers don't do so well,"" said Jesse Toprak, an independent consultant.The industry's annual sales rate for the month was 16.50 million vehicles, below the 16.7 million to 16.8 million many analysts had expected. Nevertheless, industry executives said demand remains strong and the industry was headed toward its best year in almost a decade.""Consumer and commercial customer demand for pickups and utility vehicles has been building since last fall,"" said Kurt McNeil, GM's U.S. vice president of sales operations. ""The auto industry continues to be on track to have its best sales year since 2006.""U.S. industry sales slipped to 16.5 million vehicles in 2006 from almost 17 million the prior year, and fell as low as 10.4 million in 2009 during the recession, before beginning to climb. VEHICLE PRICES RISING Ford officials said average vehicle prices in the industry were up $1,000 from last year to $31,200 per vehicle, and dismissed concerns about longer loan rates, with some now at 84 months. Ford's U.S. sales chief Mark LaNeve said the increase in duration has been driven by buyers with good credit scores stretching to buy more premium vehicles, rather than by consumers with high-risk credit.The other side of hot truck demand is weaker car sales, which has led to production cuts and layoffs by some automakers. Ford previously said it would lay off 700 people and reduce production at the Michigan plant building the Focus, which saw sales in April fall 5 percent. LaNeve vowed Ford would not create ""unnatural demand"" for cars through higher incentives.GM's April sales rose 6 percent to 269,056 vehicles as truck and crossover sales jumped 13 percent and 25 percent, respectively.Ford's sales increased 5.4 percent to 222,498 vehicles as sales of Ford-brand SUVs jumped 12 percent. Retail sales of the new F-Series pickup truck increased 8 percent, and its average sales prices hit an all-time high of $42,600 per vehicle.Fiat Chrysler's sales rose 5.8 percent to 189,027 vehicles as Jeep brand sales jumped 20 percent.Nissan sales increased 5.7 percent to 109,848 vehicles as demand for Nissan crossovers, trucks and SUVs rose 23.7 percent. Toyota was up 1.8 percent, while Honda sales fell by the same amount. Hyundai sales rose 2.9 percent, while Kia's slipped almost 1 percent.

613,"  (Recasts with final auto sales data)* Manufacturing activity muted, strong dollar cited* Auto sales slow in April after March's robust pace* Consumer sentiment rises in April from March* Construction spending hits six-month low in MarchBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, May 1 U.S. factory activity failed to gain steam in April after slowing for five straight months and demand for automobiles softened, suggesting the economy was struggling to find momentum after growth almost stalled in the first quarter.Other data on Friday showed construction spending hit a six-month low in March, also indicating that the anticipated acceleration in growth in the second quarter could disappoint.   That could see the Federal Reserve delaying raising interest rates until later this year.The economy expanded at a 0.2 percent annual pace in the first three months of the year, slammed by bad weather, a strong dollar and a now-resolved labor dispute at the West Coast ports, as well as lower oil prices, which have undercut domestic energy production.""The reacceleration in growth will not come fast enough for many, especially those looking for a liftoff by the Fed to happen sooner,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in New York. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity was at 51.5 in April, matching the March reading, which had been the lowest since May 2013.The index had declined since November and economists had expected it to rise to 52 in April. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector.While new orders rose last month, a gauge of factory employment contracted for the first time since May 2013 and recorded its lowest reading since September 2009.Manufacturing has been hit by the dollar's 12 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June.The buoyant currency has hurt export growth and profits of multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co , the world's largest household products maker, and prompted Colgate-Palmolive and healthcare conglomerate  Johnson & Johnson to cut their profit forecasts for the full year. Whirlpool Corp, the world's largest maker of home appliances, lowered its profit forecast and sales outlook for 2015.Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is also being pressured by the lower oil prices, which have caused oil-field companies to slash spending on exploration and well drilling.Caterpillar Inc has warned the dollar and weak oil prices will hurt profits this year.U.S. stocks closed higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury debt prices fell. REGAINING FOOTING Separately, auto sales fell to an annualized pace of 16.45 million vehicles last month from a 17.15 million-unit rate in March. However, General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co  reported stronger-than-expected U.S. auto sales in April on robust demand for trucks, and crossover and sports utility vehicles.Demand for autos is likely to pick up in the months ahead. In another report, the University of Michigan said its overall index on consumer sentiment rose to 95.9 this month, the second highest level since 2007, from 93.0 in March.Consumers were upbeat about both current conditions and expectations for the future. More consumers said it was a good time to buy a major household item and a vehicle. There was also an increase in consumers saying it was a good time to buy and sell a house, which should support home sales.""This suggests that there may be some upside risk for durable goods spending in the second quarter ... and that perhaps housing market activity will pick up in the months ahead,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.In a fourth report, the Commerce Department said construction spending slipped 0.6 percent to an annual rate of $966.6 billion in March, the lowest level since September.Construction spending was weighed down by a 1.6 percent decline in private residential construction spending, the biggest such decline since June. Public construction outlays were also weak.""We think the outlook for residential construction is positive in 2015 as household formation appears to have picked up and as house price gains have remained firm,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao and Andrea Ricci)",2015-05-01,F,"Fri May 1, 2015 | 4:50pm EDT",WRAPUP 3-Anemic U.S. factory data points to moderate growth bounce,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0XS0V820150501?type=companyNews

620,"   By Eyanir Chinea | CARACAS  CARACAS The Venezuela division of Ford Motor Co (F.N) will begin selling vehicles only in dollars in the coming months, two sources familiar with the situation said on Friday, as currency controls leave the automaker unable to recover revenue from local sales.A lack of parts for assembly in April led Ford de Venezuela to halt operations as it was unable to obtain dollars for import through the exchange control system. The controls have also left Ford unable to turn the local bolivar currency into greenbacks. ""We will begin sales in hard currency toward the end of June; things are very advanced,"" said a source linked to the Venezuelan network of Ford retailers, who is unauthorized to speak publicly about the issue and requested anonymity.""It has been very secretive. The government has asked that Ford be very discrete about this."" The source said retailers had put in their own dollars to import parts from Ford headquarters, which ""deconsolidated"" Venezuela operations because it could neither ensure supplies of parts nor repatriate dividends. The agreement also requires that Ford be allowed to export part of its output to other Latin American countries to ensure further supplies of hard currency, the source added. Ford de Venezuela did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Communication Ministry did not answer an email seeking comment.The measure is unlikely to be well-received by Venezuelan consumers, who have limited access to dollars. Cars are already difficult to obtain due to the production problems. A second source in the auto retail business, who is also unauthorized to speak publicly about the issue, said the remaining assembly plants are evaluating similar actions, adding that cars are already being sold in dollars by some retailers through ""under the table"" transactions. Selling goods and real estate in hard currency is not uncommon in Venezuela, but was outlawed for years and is seen as a legal gray area. The 12-year-old currency control system created by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez has steadily reduced disbursement of dollars as last year's tumble in oil prices slashed the country's hard currency revenue from exports.General Motors Co (GM.N) in April fired 450 workers and Ford is preparing to lay off 267, a union leader said in April.He added that plants that assemble Toyota (7203.T), Chrysler (FCHA.MI), Iveco, Mack, and Mitsubishi (7211.T) vehicles are also working at minimum capacity.

621,"  * U.S. manufacturing: Big promises, small gains* Factory jobs have increased but are below 1990s peak* Economists say ""reshoring"" adds few U.S. jobs* China's losses are Mexico's gainsBy Joseph White, Howard Schneider and Nick CareyDETROIT, May 8 Nike Inc's announcement that it could create up to 10,000 manufacturing jobs in the United States will spark further debate on whether the country is starting to see an industrial renaissance after many years of job losses.Evidence from government and private data suggests it is too early for U.S. workers, or politicians, to celebrate. Any boost in U.S. manufacturing appears so far to be, at best, modest and fragile.The athletic shoemaker Nike on Friday joined Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Apple Inc, General Electric Co and Ford Motor Co among U.S. businesses promising to invest in manufacturing jobs in the United States.There were 12.3 million U.S. manufacturing jobs in April, up 1.5 percent from a year earlier but well below 1990, when there were almost 18 million jobs, the government reported Friday.How best to expand manufacturing employment will be a prominent question in the 2016 election cycle, especially in Midwestern states such as Ohio and Michigan. But economists and analysts say that excitement over ""reshoring,"" or shifting jobs back to the United States from overseas, is overdone. ""Instead of hundreds of jobs at a time, manufacturers are hiring five or 10 people at a time,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago.Other measures of manufacturing activity suggest that U.S. companies are relying on more imported parts for goods they produce.The share of U.S. intermediate goods imported from Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe grew from about 2 percent in the late 1990s to almost 5 percent in 2011, only dipping briefly during the recession, according to an analysis published in November by University of Munich economist Dalia Marin.MEXICO GAINS  There are cases that counter the trends seen in the broader measures of job creation.Tailor Made Products Inc, which makes kitchen utensils, shifted production of spatulas, slotted spoons and other utensils to China about a decade ago. It was ""highly likely"" the company would have gone out of business otherwise, said chief financial officer Mike Retzer.But the company had problems with its Chinese suppliers, from delays at the U.S. West Coast ports to contaminants in the plastics used to make them. In April, as part of Wal-Mart's reshoring effort, Tailor Made opened a new production line in its home town of Elroy, Wisconsin. The company has invested $600,000 in the new line, adding up to 10 jobs to its work force of 65 to start with. More new jobs are expected if production expands. Many of the company's other kitchen products are still made in China.""We would love to move all of our production back here if we could."" Retzer said. ""But we work in an ultra-competitive environment where a penny or two on a product can make all the difference.""Michelle Gloeckler, executive vice president for U.S. manufacturing at Wal-Mart, said the retailer is on track with its plan to buy an estimated $250 billion in U.S. made goods from 2013 to 2023. In the auto industry, which accounts for about 750,000 U.S. factory jobs, vehicle makers and their parts suppliers are shifting some production out of Asia, in part to reduce the risks posed by delays at U.S. ports or natural disasters such as the 2011 tsunami in Japan.But Mexico is landing many of those jobs, says Sean McAlinden, chief economist for the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. U.S. auto industry manufacturing employment will grow to about 760,000 workers and then stay at that plateau until the next cyclical downturn, he said.Average pay for U.S. auto workers has stagnated or fallen in recent years, McAlinden said. However, U.S. workers get paid far more than their Mexican counterparts.""Mexican workers are cheaper than Chinese,"" he said. ""So why not go near-shore rather than far-shore?""In Nike's case, the company linked its promise to create U.S. jobs to relief from tariffs on imported shoes. Those levies average around 25 percent to 35 percent, depending on the materials used and the type of shoe, according to the Footwear Distributors and Retailers of America.U.S. firms paid about $400 million in tariffs in 2014 for shoes imported from countries that would be included in a Trans-Pacific trade pact, notably Vietnam, according to the trade group. The proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership would reduce tariffs. Nike manufactured 43 percent of its Nike brand shoes in Vietnam in the 2014 fiscal year, according to its disclosures.(Reporting by Joseph White and Jason Lange; Editing by Ted Botha and John Pickering)",2015-05-08,F,"Fri May 8, 2015 | 5:22pm EDT",U.S. factory job gains come slowly despite corporate vows,http://www.reuters.com//article/trade-obama-reshoring-idUSL1N0XZ1YJ20150508?type=companyNews
622,"   By Eyanir Chinea | CARACAS  CARACAS May 8 The Venezuela division of Ford Motor Co will begin selling vehicles only in dollars in the coming months, two sources familiar with the situation said on Friday, as currency controls leave the automaker unable to recover revenue from local sales.A lack of parts for assembly in April led Ford de Venezuela to halt operations as it was unable to obtain dollars for import through the exchange control system. The controls have also left Ford unable to turn the local bolivar currency into greenbacks.""We will begin sales in hard currency toward the end of June; things are very advanced,"" said a source linked to the Venezuelan network of Ford retailers, who is unauthorized to speak publicly about the issue and requested anonymity.""It has been very secretive. The government has asked that Ford be very discrete about this."" The source said retailers had put in their own dollars to import parts from Ford headquarters, which ""deconsolidated"" Venezuela operations because it could neither ensure supplies of parts nor repatriate dividends.The agreement also requires that Ford be allowed to export part of its output to other Latin American countries to ensure further supplies of hard currency, the source added.Ford de Venezuela did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Communication Ministry did not answer an email seeking comment. The measure is unlikely to be well-received by Venezuelan consumers, who have limited access to dollars. Cars are already difficult to obtain due to the production problems.A second source in the auto retail business, who is also unauthorized to speak publicly about the issue, said the remaining assembly plants are evaluating similar actions, adding that cars are already being sold in dollars by some retailers through ""under the table"" transactions. Selling goods and real estate in hard currency is not uncommon in Venezuela, but was outlawed for years and is seen as a legal gray area.The 12-year-old currency control system created by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez has steadily reduced disbursement of dollars as last year's tumble in oil prices slashed the country's hard currency revenue from exports.General Motors Co in April fired 450 workers and Ford is preparing to lay off 267, a union leader said in April.He added that plants that assemble Toyota, Chrysler , Iveco, Mack, and Mitsubishi vehicles are also working at minimum capacity.

623,"  (Repeats May 3 story for additional subscribers)By Paul Lienert and Joseph WhiteDETROIT May 3 Detroit's automakers, on track for their best sales year since 2006, may want to brace themselves for rockier times ahead.Auto executives say the industry is as healthy as it's been since being restructured in 2009. But judging by the recent stock performance of General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automotive, investors have a less robust view.Over the past year, GM and Ford share prices have lagged the overall market, in spite of moves by those two companies to give more cash back to shareholders. Fiat Chrysler prices plunged last week as Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne made increasingly overt efforts to drum up interest in a merger with one of his rivals.""The party may be starting to wind down,"" said Charles Chesbrough, senior principal economist for IHS Automotive. ""We're still looking at a good couple years of strong demand, but the days of big sales increases are behind us.""Optimists include Kurt McNeil, head of GM's U.S. sales operations, who said Friday that the industry is on track to have its best sales year since 2006. U.S. sales of cars and light trucks are estimated to reach 17 million in 2015, compared with about 10 million in 2009. U.S. consumer confidence is up, house prices are recovering and gasoline costs less than $4 a gallon in most parts of the country, supporting sales of the big trucks and SUVs that drive profits for the Detroit Three, just as they did before the financial crisis crash in 2008-2009.But there are warning signals. Sales growth is slowing in the home market, demand for small cars and family sedans is falling, revenues have declined, profits outside North America and China are virtually nonexistent and share prices have flattened.All three Detroit automakers missed analysts' expectations for first-quarter earnings. After reporting healthy April U.S. car sales on Friday, stocks fell again at all three. U.S. sales growth this year has slowed to 6 percent from double digits in 2010-2012. As demand slows, and more companies add production capacity in North America, competition from Asian and European rivals using cheap currencies will intensify. GM's share of the North American market in the first quarter slipped to 16.4 percent in the first quarter from 16.5 percent a year earlier.""Over the next couple years, we expect to see the industry cycle down - not next year, but 2017,"" said John Hoffecker, managing director and global vice chairman of operations at AlixPartners. Detroit automakers have had ""a good strong, long run,"" but ""there will be a correction from where we are today.""Before the next downturn, the U.S. carmakers ""need to find long-term solutions to sustainable profitability and cost competitiveness,"" said Xavier Mosquet, global automotive practice leader for the Boston Consulting Group. ""That may be their biggest challenge."" Part of that solution may be to reduce their dependence on the U.S. market.The companies need to reduce excess production capacity overseas, especially in Europe and South America, said Matthew Stover, auto analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group. And as U.S. demand slows, they need to generate a higher return on their overseas investments.Ford and GM are losing money in Europe even after restructuring efforts that included plant shutdowns. GM has said it expects to return to profitability in Europe in 2016. In Latin America, GM and Ford are losing money as the Brazilian economy slows and economic turmoil wracks Venezuela, where Ford earlier this year took an $800 million pre-tax writedown. GM has signaled it could stop Venezuelan production in July. In China, GM's profit margins fell to 9.9 percent in the first quarter from 11.2 percent a year earlier.""GM and Ford earn terrific rates of return in North America, but they're getting killed in Europe and South America,"" Stover said.(Reporting by Paul Lienert and Joseph White in Detroit.

624,"   By Eyanir Chinea | VALENCIA, Venezuela  VALENCIA, Venezuela The Venezuela division of Ford Motor Co (F.N) will sell pickups and sport utility vehicles in dollars, a union leader said on Wednesday, part of a deal with the government to restart operations stalled for lack of hard currency to import parts.The country's auto assembly has tumbled as companies struggle to obtain greenbacks through the 12-year-old currency controls, which have also left companies unable to repatriate revenue from their Venezuela operations.""We're doing this to avoid closing the plant,"" said Gilberto Troya, president of the United Socialist Victorious Union of Ford workers, at a press conference. Critics have pounced on the dollarized sales of cars as a sign of the economy's decay, noting that the vast majority of Venezuelans have no access to greenbacks. Government leaders dismiss the idea that a dollarization campaign is under way.  Ford dealerships will sell the Explorer Limited and Ecosport SUVs, the Lariat Pickup and three models of cargo trucks in dollars, Troya said. Economy cars such as the Ford Fiesta will continue to be priced in local bolivar currency, he added, but suggested consumers may struggle to find those models.""Some would say this is only benefiting a privileged few, but it's better than nothing,"" he said, noting that few Venezuelans have access to dollars. Ford de Venezuela did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Explorer Limited would be priced at $69,000 including sales and luxury tax, according to figures provided by the union, the equivalent of 170 years of minimum wage using the weakest official exchange rate.Dealerships will receive dollars from clients and use them to finance the import of assembly kits, because Ford no longer wants to continue putting in money.  ""Headquarters doesn't want to have anything to do with this after years of not being able to generate profit,"" Troya said.

627,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. industrial production unexpectedly fell for a fifth straight month in April due in part to a further decline in oil and gas drilling, suggesting that the economy is growing at only a modest pace in the second quarter.The economy's struggle to pick up steam after a dismal first quarter was underscored by other data on Friday showing a drop in consumer confidence to a seven-month low in early May and only a mild rebound in factory activity in New York state. Coming on the heels of weak retail sales and producer inflation data this week, the reports suggest the Federal Reserve will probably not raise interest rates anytime soon. ""It means in the next month or so we are unlikely to see a massive rebound in growth momentum. These are not the numbers that would inspire confidence in the Fed to tighten policy,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.Industrial output slipped 0.3 percent after a similar decline in March, the Fed said. Economists had expected a 0.1 percent gain. A plunge of 14.5 percent in oil and gas well drilling pushed mining production down 0.8 percent last month. It was the fourth straight monthly decline in mining output. Crude oil prices have fallen by about 50 percent since last June, resulting in a sharp drop in well drilling activity.  Companies like Schlumberger (SLB.N), the world's No. 1 oilfield services provider, and Halliburton (HAL.N) have slashed their capital spending budgets for this year. Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) has cut its 2015 profit outlook and warned that lower oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business.Oil and gas drilling is down 46.5 percent over the year and there is no relief in sight despite the recent stabilization of crude oil prices. Oil rig counts continued to decline early in the second quarter. ""We see a further drop in mining investment over the next few quarters and are not convinced that business investment ex-mining will be strong enough to sufficiently offset this drag,"" said Michelle Meyer, a senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.SENTIMENT SOURS	 In a separate report, the University of Michigan said its consumer sentiment index fell to 88.6 early this month, the lowest reading since October, from 95.9 in April.There were slight declines in consumers' attitudes toward purchases of motor vehicles and homes. While economists noted the weak relationship between consumer confidence and consumer spending, they nevertheless saw May's decline as unfavorable. Many of them believe that consumer spending will accelerate in the second quarter as households start drawing on their savings from relatively cheap gasoline prices. ""All things considered, the decline in confidence means that the potential for a pick-up in consumption growth over the next few months is probably smaller than we previously anticipated,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.The economy was slammed earlier in the year by bad weather, port disruptions, a strong dollar and deep spending cuts by energy firms. The government reported last month that GDP expanded at a 0.2 percent annual pace in the first quarter. But trade and inventory data published after the GDP snapshot suggested the economy actually contracted. Second-quarter growth estimates are currently hovering around a 2.5 percent pace, well below the 4.6 percent pace in the same period last year. U.S. stocks were marginally weaker, while prices for longer-dated U.S. government bonds rose. The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies.Last month, utilities production tumbled 1.3 percent, also contributing to the weakness in industrial output. Manufacturing production was unchanged after gaining 0.3 percent in March. Itwas restrained by a 0.9 percent drop in machinery, though motor vehicle production rose. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been dampened by the dollar. Even as the greenback rally fades, factory activity is unlikely to rebound strongly. In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index rose to 3.09 in May from -1.19 in April. A reading above zero indicates expansion.While new orders rebounded this month, order books remained depressed and inventories swelled. Labor market indicators also weakened a bit.""They suggest any pick-up in manufacturing activity will be muted, at best,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.

On Friday, the dispute spread to a Tofas plant. Tofas, owned by Italy's Fiat and local conglomerate Koc Holding , said it had halted production until the labour action was resolved, adding it did not expect the stoppage to affect sales.

632,"  (Recasts, adds background)ISTANBUL May 22 Production resumed at the Turkish operations of Ford and Fiat Chrysler on Friday after a labour dispute disrupted output for about a week and embarrassed the government ahead of a parliamentary election.But assembly lines remained stalled at Renault's local operations, while tractor maker Turk Traktor said on Friday it was forced to halt production because of the dispute.The dispute over working conditions and pay started late last week at factories in the northwest city of Bursa and  spread to a number of parts suppliers in the area, where Turkey's auto industry in centred. Ford Otosan said operations had restarted at its Golcuk and Yenikoy plants in the northwest.Tofas, a joint venture between Fiat and Koc Holding, said its production had restarted, adding it had no problems in getting parts from suppliers. Renault has said it might reconsider investment in Turkey if the labour dispute brings instability. Workers said the dispute was sparked after union Turk Metal last month negotiated a 60 percent wage hike for workers at a plant run by parts maker Bosch Fren, but failed to secure a similar deal elsewhere.The protests highlight what critics call one of the contradictions of Turkey's economic progress - that years of rapid growth have not been accompanied by a significant improvement in working conditions.Around 40 percent of Turkish employees work 50 or more hours a week, the highest among the more than 30 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

633,"  * Three Keydata bosses fined nearly 80 million pounds* Individuals are appealing against the decision* Three Keydata bosses banned from financial services* Ford to file 650 mln stg claim against FCA, PwC   (Adds Keydata CEO's claim against FCA, PwC)By Matt ScuffhamLONDON, May 26 The boss of a firm which sold so-called ""death bonds"" was hit with a 75 million pounds ($116 million) fine on Tuesday by Britain's financial regulator, the biggest penalty it has ever handed to an individual.The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said it would impose the fine on Stewart Ford, former chief executive of Keydata Investment Services. In response, Ford said he would file a claim against the FCA and accountancy firm PwC, Keydata's administrator, seeking damages in the order of 650 million pounds.Some 30,000 people, mainly pensioners, ploughed more than 450 million pounds into Keydata. Death bonds are second-hand life insurance policies whose value depends in part on the death of the original insurance holders, often wealthy former professionals living in the United States. Partly because of the longevity of the rich, actual returns often fell far short of those promised by sales staff to often elderly investors.Keydata was shut by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the FCA's predecessor, in 2009 and many investors lost much of their life savings.The FCA also handed fines of 4 million pounds and 200,000 pounds respectively to Mark Owen, former sales director, and Peter Johnson, former compliance officer. It said the individuals would be banned from roles in the regulated financial services market. Neither could be reached for comment. DUE DILIGENCE The FCA said Ford, Owen and Johnson failed to act with integrity and misled the FSA on a number of occasions in relation to the performance of the products.The regulator said the products were sold to customers as if they were eligible for inclusion in Britain's tax-free individual savings accounts (ISAs), but this was not the case. It said the three were aware it was highly likely the products did not comply with ISA regulations and the products were promoted in a misleading way, while the due diligence on them was inadequate.In an e-mail, Ford said the FSA ""knowingly exceeded its statutory authority in order to bring down Keydata as a blatant attempt to prove it could be effective after its disastrous handling of bank regulation in the lead-up to the 2008/9 financial crisis"".The FCA declined comment. PwC said: ""We have had no contact from Mr Ford, so are unable to comment on his alleged claims. We do not believe he has any grounds to bring an action.""The decisions are pending an appeal by the three to the Upper Tribunal, an independent judicial body. ""I welcome the fact that this matter is at last going to be properly considered by the High Court and by the Upper Tribunal who will be able to finally see the truth,"" said Ford.The regulator said Ford and his family had received 72.4 million pounds in fees and commissions following the sale of the products and Owen received commissions worth 2.5 million.($1 = 0.6491 pounds)   (Editing by Jason Neely and David Holmes)",2015-05-26,F,"Tue May 26, 2015 | 10:50am EDT",UPDATE 3-UK regulator fines 'death bonds' boss $116 million,http://www.reuters.com//article/britain-deathbonds-idUSL5N0YH1R420150526?type=companyNews

635,"  * Automakers announce additional models covered by last week's expanded recall* FCA recall expands to 5.22 mln vehicles worldwide* Air bags can explode with too much force, spewing shrapnel* U.S. House subcommittee sets hearing for June 2   (Adds Ford, Mitsubishi recall expansions; adds Nissan not expanding recall)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT, May 28 Five automakers on Thursday widened recalls of cars and trucks with Takata Corp air bags and the U.S. Congress set a hearing next week on the safety issue that has been linked to six deaths.Takata last week complied with demands of U.S. safety regulators and doubled the vehicles to be involved in air bag recalls to 34 million, making it the largest recall in American history. The total number globally is more than 53 million vehicles.The air bags are at risk of exploding with too much force and spewing metal fragments inside the car, regulators say. All six deaths linked to the problem were in Honda Motor Co Ltd  vehicles. The recalls announced on Thursday by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , Honda, BMW, Ford Motor Co and Mitsubishi Motors Corp are included in the figures issued last week by Takata and U.S. regulator the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.Automakers, regulators and Takata have yet to identify the root cause of the problem.A hearing billed as an update on the Takata safety issue will be held next Tuesday afternoon by the U.S. House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade. U.S. Representative Fred Upton, a Michigan Republican, said on Thursday:  ""When an air bag - a device built to enhance motorist safety - is actually putting families in peril, we can't wait years for a fix.""U.S. lawmakers have complained that both Takata and NHTSA were mishandling the air bag safety issue. NHTSA has tried to show its bite under new head Mark Rosekind, who took the helm in January.Rosekind will appear before the subcommittee next week. The panel will also hear from Takata Executive Vice President Kevin Kennedy, two leaders of automaker lobbying groups and the director of an independent testing organization.Fiat Chrysler on Thursday expanded its recalls of vehicles with Takata air bags to about 5.22 million worldwide, involving the 2003 to 2011 model years. About 4.5 million of those vehicles are in the United States. Most of the vehicles have been involved in previous recall campaigns, FCA said. Ford widened its recall of vehicles with Takata air bags to 1.51 million vehicles globally, including 1.38 million in the United States. The worldwide figure is up from 543,031 before last week's announcements by NHTSA and Takata, Ford said.Honda expanded its recall of vehicles with Takata air bag inflators by 350,000 in the United States and 340,000 in Japan.Since 2008, Honda has recalled about 20 million vehicles worldwide with Takata air bag parts.BMW said it is widening U.S. recalls of models with Takata air bags to 420,661 vehicles from 140,696.Mitsubishi Motors Corp widened its recall of vehicles with Takata air bags to 82,784 in the U.S. market.Nissan Motor Co told NHTSA that it will not expand its recall of U.S. recalls equipped with Takata air bags.

636,"  (Adds details on EV plans from Tesla, Ford, GM, Nissan, VW)May 28 Ford Motor Co said it would give other automakers access to its electrified vehicle technologies for a fee to accelerate research and development of such vehicles.Ford's offer comes nearly a year after a move by Tesla Motors Inc, the California electric car maker, to share its patents with other companies, though at no charge.Despite billions of dollars of investment by automakers and suppliers, and thousands of dollars per car of federal and state tax incentives, consumer demand for electrified vehicles has fallen far short of government and industry projections.Indeed, the sale of electric vehicles, including gas-electric hybrids and pure battery EVs, made up a fraction of total U.S. vehicle sales this year and last.One of the biggest obstacles to wider acceptance of electric cars is the driving range between charges. Automakers and suppliers are addressing this ""range anxiety"" in several ways, including installation of more battery charging stations and development of new batteries that will enable EVs to travel up to 200 miles or more between charges.At least four major automakers, Ford, General Motors Co , Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Volkswagen AG , plan to join Tesla in offering such extended-range EVs in the next two to three years. Ford is developing a new family of electrified compact cars for 2018-2019 that could include plug-in hybrid and pure battery versions, suppliers told Reuters in March.Ford said on Thursday that providing access to its patents ""will promote faster development of future inventions.""The company said it has more than 650 EV patents and about 1,000 pending patent applications on EV technologies. It has six hybrid or fully electrified vehicles in the market: The Ford Focus electric, the Ford Fusion hybrid, the Ford Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid, the Ford C-MAX hybrid, the Ford C-MAX Energi plug-in hybrid and the Lincoln MKZ hybrid.Ford filed for more than 400 patents for EV technologies in 2014. This represents over 20 percent of the total patents the automaker applied for last year.Companies can access Ford's patents and published patent applications through its technology commercialization and licensing office or through AutoHarvest, an online platform for automakers to collaborate.Ford also said it would hire 200 EV engineers this year.

638,"   By Ryan Vlastelica and Sinead Carew | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Shares of U.S. automakers may finally be able to accelerate.Investors are closely awaiting next week's May sales data, expected to come in near record levels. Meeting those forecasts could be enough to lift the sector - among the cheapest in the market - putting the sting of product recalls and tepid recent growth in the rear view mirror.Estimated sales of 1.6 million new cars and trucks in May would make for a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 17.4 million vehicles, according to Edmunds.com, a car buying platform. ""This is going to be one of the best months ever,"" said David Kudla, chief investment strategist of Mainstay Capital Management in Grand Blanc, Michigan. Kudla sees May sales approaching $40 billion, not far from the $40.3 billion record in August 2014.Weak auto results contributed to flat overall retail sales in April, but May is expected to represent a rebound. Lower gas prices could boost demand for sports utility vehicles and trucks, which have higher price tags and better margins.There is also pent-up demand for new vehicles as consumers have been holding on to their cars for longer since the financial crisis. The average age of U.S. cars is now between 10 and 11 years, Kudla said. The timing of the Memorial Day holiday also helped May sales, according to Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst at Edmunds.com in Santa Monica, California. “Because there was a full week of May after the holiday weekend, shoppers had plenty of time to take advantage of the deals being widely communicated in dealer and automaker marketing messages,” Caldwell said.Credit for auto loans is expanding, a positive sign for the sector, noted Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank in Chicago. ""The strong dollar created a headwind, and GM had some high-profile product recalls, but given current trends, I would expect sales growth to continue.""Both GM and Ford appear undervalued at current levels. GM's forward price-to-earnings ratio is 7.62, well below the S&P 500's 17.4 ratio, while Ford's P/E is 8.77, according to Thomson Reuters data.Both also rank among the cheapest S&P 500 stocks per StarMine's intrinsic value, which looks at anticipated growth over the next decade. GM is the fourth-cheapest stock in the S&P by this metric, with StarMine estimating that shares should trade at $81.69, more than twice its Thursday closing price of $36.39. StarMine calculates that Ford is the 10th cheapest stock in the S&P, and that it would need to rise 79 percent to meet its intrinsic value.

Year-to-date, sales were up 3 percent at 755,582 units.""The Canadian new vehicle market remains to be on track for the best selling year ever as the industry reported the highest monthly sales in history last month,"" DesRosiers Automotive Consultants wrote in a note to clients.The automotive market research firm also noted the ""luxury vehicle market continues to gain momentum,"" citing double-digit percentage gains for Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Land Rover, Infiniti, BMW and Lexus. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' Canadian sales edged up by 119 vehicles from a year earlier to 31,617 cars and trucks in May, as a rise in Jeep and passenger car sales helped offset lower minivan sales.The company's Windsor, Ontario, van plant was shut for retooling from Feb. 16 to May 25, reducing supplies of some of the Canadian unit's top-selling vehicles. Sales of the Grand Caravan slid 45 percent in May to 3,285 vehicles. Ford's Canadian sales dropped 8.5 percent from a year earlier, to 29,052 cars and trucks, as car sales fell 7.1 percent, and truck sales dropped 9 percent.GM Canada reported the largest sales gain for May among the Detroit automakers, with 27,462 cars and trucks sold in the month, up 3.8 percent from a year ago.

643,"  (Adds final auto sales figure, analyst comment, updates market)* Factory orders fall 0.4 percent in April* Orders excluding transportation flat for second month* April core capital goods orders revised down to show drop* Auto sales rise strongly in May, could boost consumer spendingBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, June 2 New orders for U.S. factory goods fell in April on weak demand for transportation equipment and other goods, suggesting that manufacturing remained constrained by a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector.The outlook for manufacturing and the broader economy, however, got a lift from another report on Tuesday showing automobile sales in May rising at their briskest pace in a decade.""The outlook for manufacturing is modestly positive. Demand from consumers and businesses is growing slowly. Households are gradually boosting their spending on manufactured goods,"" said Gus Faucher, a senior economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh.New orders for manufactured goods slipped 0.4 percent after increasing 2.2 percent in March. Factory orders have declined in eight of the last nine months. Economists had forecast orders to be unchanged in April. Excluding the volatile transport component, orders were flat for a second straight month.Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been hit by the dollar and lower crude oil prices, which are pressuring the profits of multinational corporations and oil-field firms. Orders for transportation equipment fell 2.4 percent in April. There also were declines in orders for information technology equipment, computers and related products, and consumer goods.Separately, auto sales last month rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 17.79 million units, the strongest since  summer 2005, up from a 16.50 million-unit pace in April.General Motors Co reported a 3 percent increase. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  said sales rose 4 percent. Ford Motor Co's sales, however, fell 1 percent as demand for its F-Series pickup trucks slackened.Strong auto sales could buoy May consumer spending, which was flat in April after households cut back on purchases of motor vehicles. A rebound in consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, is being eyed after slowing down sharply in the first quarter.Consumer spending was sluggish even as households got a boost from cheaper gasoline and steadily rising wages. CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC ""We have been looking for a bounce back in consumption growth following the puzzlingly weak April data and today's sales reports from auto manufacturers suggest these gains are starting to materialize,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.The dollar fell sharply against the euro on hopes that Greece would reach a deal with its creditors. Prices for U.S. government also dropped, while U.S. stocks rose marginally.There is cautious hope that consumer spending will offset the drag on growth from continued cutbacks in business spending. Gross domestic product contracted at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year.Federal Reserve board member Lael Brainard warned on Tuesday the economic weakness at the start of the year could be more than transitory, citing the dollar and sluggish business investment.The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, which are seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans, fell 0.3 percent in April instead of the 1.0 percent advance reported last month.Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, were revised down to show only a 0.5 percent gain in April instead of the previously reported 0.8 percent rise.Lower oil prices prompted Schlumberger, the world's top oil-field services provider, and rival Halliburton  to slash their capital expenditure for this year.Multinational corporations including Procter & Gamble Co , the world's largest household products maker, and Whirlpool Corp, the global home appliances giant, have warned that the dollar will hurt profits this year.But there are signs the downturn could be nearing its end as the dollar rally fades, the supply chain normalizes after being disrupted by a labor dispute at West Coast ports and business spending outside the energy sector picks up.A report on Monday showed factory activity rising for the first time in seven months in May and new orders increasing solidly.""We are moving past the weakest period for energy-related capex ... which should be a positive development for the manufacturing sector,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao and Chizu Nomiyama)",2015-06-02,F,"Tue Jun 2, 2015 | 4:21pm EDT",WRAPUP 3-U.S. factory orders weak; robust auto sales a bright spot,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0YO0Z620150602?type=companyNews

Six assembly plants and 10 plants that feed into them will be affected, it said on Tuesday.The assembly plants produce some of Ford's top-selling models, including the highly profitable F-150 pickup truck as well as sports utilities Explorer, Edge and Escape. The F-150 has been the top-selling model in North America since the 1970s. The plants affected include one each in Chicago; Dearborn, Michigan; Kansas City, Missouri; two in Louisville, Kentucky; and one in Oakville, Ontario. Ford also said Tuesday it will launch the new version of its Sync infotainment system, Sync 3, as an option on 2016 Ford Escape compact sport utilities and Fiesta small cars that go on sale this summer.Ford said in December that it planned to replace the current Sync, based on software developed by Microsoft Corp  with a new system based on smartphone maker Blackberry Ltd's  QNX software.Pricing for the new system will vary. On the Escape SE model, Sync 3 will be part of a package of features with a list price of $1,395, Ford said. It will be standard on the higher priced Titanium Escape models.

651,"  (Adds background including auto worker labor costs and percentages of second-tier workers by company)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT, June 9 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles   said its North American labor chief Al Iacobelli has retired less than two months before company negotiations with the United Auto Workers union.Iacobelli, 55, will be replaced by Glenn Shagena, 52, FCA's former head of human resources in Mexico, effective immediately, the company said on Tuesday.A spokesman for the UAW, which represents about 35,700 Fiat Chrysler workers in the United States, declined to comment. Fiat Chrysler is one of three U.S. automakers that will enter what many expect to be difficult contract talks next month with the UAW, due to the issue of a two-tiered pay and benefit structure for UAW-represented workers.In 2007, the UAW agreed to a lower pay and benefit scale for newly hired auto workers as all three companies were losing money. After the 2011 round of talks, the automakers began hiring a significant number of new workers at the lower tier of pay and benefits. Entry-level, or second-tier workers are paid $15.78 to $19.28 per hour, less than the $28 to $28.50 for veteran UAW assembly line workers. The latter also have richer benefits.UAW President Dennis Williams has said the union wants to ""bridge the gap"" between the two tiers in the upcoming talks. About 45 percent of FCA's UAW-represented workers are in the second tier, more than the 29 percent of second-tier workers for Ford Motor Co and 20 percent for GM. Ford has a 20 percent cap for second-tier workers, but its numbers are higher because of exemptions allowed.A recent labor cost study by the Center for Automotive Research showed that FCA's costs for wages and benefits for auto workers were lower, at $48 per hour, than those of GM, at $58 per hour, and Ford, at $55 per hour.FCA Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne has spoken out against the two-tiered system in the United States and said he wants to peg more worker compensation to company profits.(Reporting by Bernie Woodall; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Richard Chang)",2015-06-09,F,"Tue Jun 9, 2015 | 1:43pm EDT",UPDATE 2-Fiat Chrysler North American labor chief retires ahead of talks,http://www.reuters.com//article/fiat-chrysler-labor-idUSL1N0YV1FQ20150609?type=companyNews

Such systems, the precursors of fully autonomous vehicles, enable hands-free operation of cars under certain conditions by automating such basic functions as steering, braking and throttle.Ford has lagged behind competitors, notably General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG's (VOWG_p.DE) Audi, Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz and Tesla Motors Inc, which have all announced plans to begin offering semi-automated driving systems over the next 18 months. On Tuesday, Ford said it had created a global team to develop self-driving vehicles, with 29-year company veteran Randy Visintainer as director.The move elevates a low-key research effort to a higher-profile advanced engineering project, and signals Chief Executive Mark Fields' intent to accelerate Ford's presence in the area.""During the next five years, we will move to migrate driver-assist technologies across our product lineup (and) continue to increase automated driving capability,"" Raj Nair, Ford's global product development chief, said Tuesday in Palo Alto, California.

It will generate $1,500 more profit per car than the old model, GM estimated.Cool technology features are aimed at young buyers, including Android Auto and Apple CarPlay to link smartphone screens to the car's dashboard screen. GM sells the Cruze in 40 markets, including the United States, China, Brazil and India.The more high-tech Cruze is part of a broader product strategy that GM Chief Executive Mary Barra points to when making her case that GM can thrive without taking on a partner, such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. GM's revamped compact sedan will drive into a crowd of competitors with similar performance, features and functionality in the same price range - about $16,000 to $26,000 in the United States.GM touted the 40 miles per gallon the car's new four cylinder engine should deliver on the highway. This would match the fuel economy rating for Ford Motor Co's competing Focus model on sale now. Sales of the current Cruze in the United States, Chevrolet's largest market, lag those of the small car leaders, Toyota Motor Corp's Corolla and Honda Motor Co Ltd's Civic.Toyota has sold 159,486 Corollas in the United States through May 31 this year, while GM has sold 105,291 Cruzes.

669,"  BEIJING, July 1 Toyota Motor Corp  posted its fastest monthly sales growth for China in more than a year in June, keeping the Japanese automaker on track to meet its full-year sales target for the world's largest auto maker.The company and its two local joint-venture partners sold about 100,600 cars in the world's largest auto market last month, a 41.7 percent increase year-on-year and the fastest sales growth since February 2014, when sales grew 43.1 percent.Spokesman Takanori Yokoi said on Wednesday the rise was due in part to ""technical"" reasons, as the automaker's sales dipped in the same month last year while it phased out the older version of its Corolla compact in preparation for the newer model.The gain, however, is a positive sign for the auto industry in China which has suffered a major slowdown in sales this year as the economy grows at its slackest pace in 25 years. Overall passenger and commercial vehicle sales for the industry fell 0.4 percent year-on-year in May to 1.9 million vehicles, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). During the first six months of this year, Toyota sold about 512,800 cars, up 10.1 percent from the same period a year earlier, putting it on track to meet its 2015 growth target for China, where it aims to sell 1.1 million vehicles.Weak sales have spurred General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Volkswagen AG to slash prices and offer discounts in China in recent months.

""The deal became necessary because of the crisis -- our debt was in roubles but a lot of our equipment is imported,"" he told Vedomosti.

681,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) on Tuesday will launch a new luxury version of its F-150 pickup truck that could command prices above $60,000, answering growing demand from U.S. consumers for trucks that could substitute for a higher end German sedan.   The 2016 Ford F-150 Limited will go on sale later this year, and will be a step up from the automaker's current top-of-the-line pickup, the F-150 Platinum.Low gasoline prices along with better fuel economy have boosted demand for feature-laden duty trucks and large SUVs which are helping the bottom lines for the three Detroit automakers.One of the features that comes standard on the new F-150 Limited will be ""multicontour massaging seats.""

686,"   By Chris Knight, NASCAR Wire Service  Bell slings to dramatic win at Eldora SpeedwayBy Chris Knight, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeIn one of the most anticipated races of the year, Christopher Bell scored a dramatic win in the third annual 1-800-CAR-CASH Mud Summer Classic on the famed Eldora Speedway dirt.It was the first victory for Bell in just his third career start. Bell's triumph marked back-to-back victories for Kyle Busch Motorsports in the No. 54 Toyota Tundra at Eldora.""It's just unbelievable,"" said Bell in Victory Lane. ""I've been coming here quite a few times and if you would have told me two years ago that my first win at Eldora was going to be in a truck, I would have told you you're crazy. This is just fantastic. I'm just thrilled to be here.""Veteran dirt late model ace Bobby Pierce scored the Keystone Light Pole Award earlier in the day, giving MB Motorsports, one of the longest running teams in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, its first-ever pole. Pierce lost the lead on Lap 1 to John Hunter Nemechek, but took it back on Lap 2.Pierce maintained control of the race, until a Lap 42 restart when Bell, also a dirt veteran, swiped the lead from Pierce in Turn 1. Bell led through Lap 60.When Spencer Gallagher spun on lap 53, NASCAR utilized the yellow flag to serve as the competition caution originally scheduled for Lap 60, allowing teams to come in for tires and fuel. Brad Keselowski elected to stay out during the caution, inheriting the lead alongside Bell for the Lap 61 restart.Bell quickly slid by Keselowski a lap later and stretched his advantage by 1.5 seconds until a debris caution on Lap 72 brought the field to his bumper.Through the race's then-longest green flag stretch, Bell increased his lead on Pierce, but when Chris Fontaine spun on Lap 94, it once again bunched up the field.On the restart, Pierce attacked Bell and stole the lead on the backstretch and kept it through a yellow for John Wes Townley on Lap 94. Bell slid in front of Pierce two laps after the restart and held the point until the end of segment two for the second competition caution of the night.Under the yellow, most of the field elected to stay out, setting up for the start of segment three, a 40-lap dash.Showcasing his dirt track skills, Bell checked out from the field with Pierce, Ty Dillon, Austin Dillon and Tyler Reddick chasing. The opportunity to pull away would be denied when the 11th caution flag of the night waved.Chasing his first career win in his truck series debut, Pierce stalking Bell for the lead, made contact with the Turn 4 wall with about 15 laps remaining, causing significant rear-end damage. Even with a battered truck, Pierce stayed on the throttle. The challenge for the lead would be slowed with 11 laps remaining when Timothy Peters went for a solo spin in Turn 2.A five-lap sprint to the finish set up for the winner of the 1-800-CAR-CASH Mud Summer Classic with Bell and Pierce up front on the restart.Bell would accelerate hard, while a slow restart for Pierce put him in the clutches of Austin Dillon and Tyler Reddick. Pierce escaped them and set his sights on Bell.When Korbin Forrister spun with two laps to go, the drama meter pegged even more, setting up for a green-white-checkered finish.On the final restart of the night, Bell refused to give up the race lead and withstood an attempted pass by Pierce on the last lap to earn the win.""I'll tell you that's pretty awesome that Bobby and I could come here and run 1-2,"" added Bell. ""I never heard of him until I was at a sprint car race last year and he was running his late model. It's pretty cool that a couple of dirt guys could run 1-2 at a dirt race track.""Tyler Reddick finished third ahead of Erik Jones and Daniel Hemric. Inaugural Eldora winner Austin Dillon was sixth followed by Nemechek, Cameron Hayley, Matt Crafton and Ty Dillon.The NASCAR Camping World Truck Series returns to action on Aug. 1 at Pocono (Pa.)

687,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Victims of apartheid in South Africa cannot pursue lawsuits seeking to hold Ford Motor Co and IBM Corp liable for conducting business that helped perpetuate the practice decades ago, a U.S. appeals court ruled on Monday.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said black South Africans did not show that Ford and International Business Machines Corp engaged in enough wrongdoing in the United States from the 1970s to early 1990s to justify lawsuits over their alleged roles in killings, torture and other human rights abuses.Ford was accused of providing military vehicles for South African security forces and sharing information about anti-apartheid and union activists.

Upholding that dismissal, Circuit Judge José Cabranes wrote for a 3-0 appeals court panel that Ford could not be held directly responsible for alleged improper actions by its South African unit.He also found no showing that ""by developing hardware and software to collect innocuous population data,"" IBM purposefully contributed to apartheid-era abuses.""Knowledge of or complicity in the perpetration of a crime under the law of nations (customary international law) - absent evidence that a defendant purposefully facilitated the commission of that crime - is insufficient to establish a claim of aiding and abetting liability under the ATS,"" Cabranes wrote.

Upholding Scheindlin's ruling, Circuit Judge José Cabranes wrote for a 3-0 appeals court panel that Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford could not be held directly responsible for alleged improper actions by its South African unit.He also found no showing that ""by developing hardware and software to collect innocuous population data,"" Armonk, New York-based IBM purposefully contributed to apartheid-era abuses. ""Knowledge of or complicity in the perpetration of a crime under the law of nations (customary international law )- absent evidence that a defendant purposefully facilitated the commission of that crime-is insufficient to establish a claim of aiding and abetting liability under the ATS,"" Cabranes wrote.Diane Sammons, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, argued that Ford's U.S. conduct justified liability, and called it ""astounding"" that IBM's conduct was not deemed purposeful.""We certainly will consider an appeal to the Supreme Court,"" she said. Ford and IBM did not immediately respond to requests for comment. IBM's full name is International Business Machines Corp.Germany's Daimler AG and Rheinmetall AG  were dismissed as defendants from the case in December 2013. Dozens of companies were previously dismissed.Apartheid ended in 1994 when South Africa held its first all-race elections, bringing Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress to power.The case is In re: South African Apartheid Litigation, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-4104.

Chief Executive Dianne Craig said sales are ""on track with the overall business strategy.""GM Canada sales dropped 4.8 percent to 22,826 vehicles as car sales dropped 12.4 percent and truck sales declined 1.9 percent.

The car's powerful and fuel-efficient engine will also be fitted into other vehicles Ford plans to export to Africa and Southeast Asia, executives say. ""We are being challenged to find engineering solutions at lower costs than we have traditionally been able to do,"" John Lonsdale, head of Ford's B-car program in Asia Pacific, told Reuters in a recent interview in the western city of Udaipur.""This market, probably even more than Brazil, is demanding cost strategies and cost structures that are lower than anywhere else,"" he said.B-cars, loosely defined as compact cars, are key to the growth of automakers like Ford in India and beyond: global sales of such cars are expected to rise by more than a third to 11.4 million by 2020, according to analysts at IHS Automotive. India is expected to become the world's third largest market by 2020, when sales of B-cars are expected to double to around 1.73 million, IHS Automotive added.Ford did not say how much the Aspire would cost ahead of its launch, but executives said that 80 percent of the car had been made locally to keep the price low.

The 37-year-old food company executive lost nearly $6,500 when shares tumbled in June and July, and can't now afford the new Volkswagen Tiguan sport-utility vehicle he had his eye on. ""I can't draw money,"" Zhang said, ""I'll wait until (the market) goes up.""Auto sales in China fell 7.1 percent in July from a year earlier as many more who lost out in a trillion-dollar share slump joined Zhang in delaying purchases. The monthly drop, the biggest in two and a half years, was the fourth in a row and marked China's longest streak of sales declines since at least the 2008 global financial crisis.    Sales for January to July grew only 0.4 percent, the slowest first seven months of the year since at least 2009, and global brands from Ford Motor Co (F.N) to Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) are bracing for a sustained period of dwindling demand and depressed prices. That will squeeze profit, create an inventory burden for dealers and ramp up already-fierce competition.    China-based managers and executives at major global automakers say that leaves companies now pushing staff hard to meet targets despite the bleak outlook. Gloom over China's economy was highlighted on Tuesday when it devalued the yuan after a run of poor economic data.At Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), China's best-selling car brand, a regional manager at a sales subsidiary said the automaker is pressing for staff to continue to meet targeted sales numbers to protect its market share, forcing inventory on dealers that will bite into their profit.  ""The dealers are the first to cry,"" the manager said, referring to tensions with the automaker.A Volkswagen spokeswoman said financially healthy dealers are part of the company's strategy as ""only satisfied dealers guarantee satisfied customers."" LIMITED OPTIMISM At Ford, sixth-largest by sales in China, officials are working to find ways to match uncertainty over the future of sales trends with the necessity to plan production. Last Friday the automaker said it sold 6 percent fewer cars in July than in the same month last year, doubling the year-on-year decline from June.""The next two to four months will be the most important and also the most difficult,"" said one person close to Ford with knowledge of production plans. Short-term production adjustments are growing more frequent, he said, leading suppliers to incur greater costs.  ""Any changes to the manufacturing plan of finished cars will effect thousands of parts, thereby influencing hundreds of suppliers,"" he said. A Ford spokeswoman said production adjustments are normal even with only a few days and weeks of lead time. Any adjustments are in accordance with supplier contracts, she said.While optimism is in short supply, Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) have shown one way forward, hoisting sales thanks to recent launches of new, ever-popular SUVs.Some analysts even predict a return to sales growth later this year as the stock market stabilizes. They see expansion in high-single digit percentages next year, the strongest sales since 2013, bearing in mind that China still has low levels of car ownership compared with mature markets in the United States and Europe.

713,"  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) on Wednesday will start building its medium-duty F-650 and F-750 commercial trucks at a Cleveland-area plant, moving production out of Mexico for the first time.The shift to the 41-year-old plant in Avon Lake, Ohio means that about 1,000 workers represented by the United Auto Workers union will keep their jobs, Jimmy Settles, UAW vice president, said in a statement issued by the company. There are about 1,400 workers at the Avon Lake complex.Ford is currently in negotiations with the UAW for a new national contract affecting about 52,300 workers. Just before those talks began last month, Ford announced it would move production of small cars Focus and C-Max from a plant in Wayne, Michigan. Ford has not confirmed UAW comments that the production is shifting to Mexico.""Working with our partners in the UAW, we found a way to make the costs competitive enough to bring production of a whole new generation of work trucks to Ohio,” said Joe Hinrichs, Ford president of North America and South America. The commercial trucks from 2000 until earlier this year were built by a joint venture of Ford and Navistar International Corp (NAV.N) called Blue Diamond in Escobedo, Mexico.   The trucks are often sold as cab-and-chassis skeletons and customized by purchasers to serve a wide range of uses from beverage delivery to ambulances to oilfield services.The 2016 model year trucks go on sale later this summer, which is a few months later than Ford had announced when it first announced the shift of production to Ohio in March 2014. For every F-650 or F-750 truck sold to a fleet buyer, another six Ford trucks are also sold to the same customer, said Mike Levine, Ford truck spokesman. He said that in 2014, the company sold 9,627 F-650 and F-750 models, which was 11 percent more than the previous year.The trucks will sell from $56,705 for a gasoline-powered regular cab F-650 to $76,690 for a diesel-powered tractor crew cab. Prices include delivery charges. The Avon Lake plant was where Ford for years built Econoline vans. In recent years, the name was changed to E-Series vans, which are no longer produced.

""This market, probably even more than Brazil, is demanding cost strategies and cost structures that are lower than anywhere else,"" he said.B-cars, loosely defined as compact cars, are key to the growth of automakers like Ford in India and beyond: global sales of such cars are expected to rise by more than a third to 11.4 million by 2020, according to IHS Automotive.India is expected to become the world's third-largest market by 2020, when sales of B-cars are expected to double to around 1.73 million, IHS added.Analysts, however, said that despite selling cars in India for more than two decades, Ford faced an uphill battle against more established Asian rivals in the compact car segment.""Ford is following a tried and tested approach... but it is late in implementing it,"" said Puneet Gupta, senior associate at IHS.

721,"  * Toyota says facilities near blast site damaged* VW, Ford, others assessing damage to cars parked nearby* Tianjin is China's largest auto import hub   (Recasts, adds details from automakers)By Jake Spring and Maki ShirakiBEIJING/TOKYO, Aug 14 Global automakers including Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp  scrambled on Friday to assess damage to cars and facilities after two massive explosions in the port city of Tianjin, China's largest auto import hub.The blasts that ripped through a warehouse storing volatile chemicals in the northeastern city late on Wednesday were so strong that they damaged buildings a few kilometres away.French carmaker Renault SA said nearly 1,500 of its imported cars stored in a warehouse at the port had been burned while Toyota said the blasts broke windows at its car assembly, logistics, and research buildings, which are jointly run with China FAW Group Corporation. Operations at the Toyota facilities had been closed for a week-long summer holiday and no one was injured, but a spokesman at Japan's biggest carmaker declined to say whether it could resume production as normal from Monday.""In our current view, the damage isn't that severe,"" a China-based Toyota spokesman said.Roughly 40 percent of cars imported to China pass through Tianjin's port, or more than half a million units in 2014, according to the official Xinhua news agency. China imported 372.4 billion yuan ($60.8 billion) in cars last year, official data shows.The blasts tore through an industrial area in the broader Tianjin port, killing at least 54 people, including a dozen fire fighters, state media said. About 700 people were injured. Subaru maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd said more than 100 cars that were imported from Japan and were awaiting customs clearance in a warehouse had been damaged by broken windows. The warehouse, which does not belong to Fuji Heavy, is about 2 km (1.2 miles) from the blast site, it said.Volkswagen said that some of its imported cars were damaged but did not know exactly how many had been affected. Photographs from the scene showed rows of Beetles and other VW brand cars badly scorched by the explosion.""We have a task force in the area to find out more and which is primarily concerned with the wellbeing of our employees,"" a VW spokeswoman said. Ford Motor Co, Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Toyota also said they were checking their cars parked around the port.South Korea's Hyundai Motor Corp and Kia Motors Corp had a total of 4,000 cars near the blast site but did not have specific details on the extent of damage, the companies said.BMW AG said it has two vehicle distribution centres near the port but the damage was unknown given the area had been cordoned off by authorities.Mazda Motor Corp said over 50 cars imported from Japan were also damaged, with peeling paint and scratches. One nearby showroom was shut on Thursday after its windows shattered, it said.Other Japanese businesses with a presence in Tianjin including a mall owned by Aeon Co and an Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd department store sustained minor damage. Otsuka Holdings Co said a factory that makes the Pocari Sweat sports drink would be closed on Friday and Saturday as it assesses the site's safety.Shipping giant Nippon Yusen KK said it could not assess damage at a terminal it operates in Tianjin because the area was off-limits, adding that a few workers sustained minor injuries at an affiliated car distribution company, which was also closed off.

724,"   By Paul Lienert and Julia Love | DETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO  DETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO Aug 21 Consumer electronics company Apple Inc has hired a senior engineer from electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc, according to a LinkedIn posting, as part of Apple's effort to build a team of experts in automated driving.A LinkedIn profile for Jamie Carlson shows that he has left Tesla and moved to Apple. At least six others with experience developing self-driving technology and systems have joined Apple, according to their LinkedIn profiles.Attempts to reach all seven people were unsuccessful and Apple declined to comment.Sources have said that Apple is developing a car and studying self-driving technology, but it is unclear if the iPhone maker is designing a vehicle that could drive itself. Since January, Apple has hired Megan McClain, a former Volkswagen AG engineer with expertise in automated driving, and Vinay Palakkode, a graduate researcher at Carnegie Mellon University, a hub of automated driving research.In August, Apple hired Xianqiao Tong, an engineer who developed computer vision software for driver assistance systems at microchip maker Nvidia Corp. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Apple hired Paul Furgale, former deputy director of the Autonomous Systems Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, earlier this year.So-called advanced driver assistance systems, or ADAS, handle tasks such as keeping a vehicle in a lane or driving by itself in stop-and-go traffic, and they are considered the building blocks for self-driving cars. According to Carlson's LinkedIn profile, he joined Apple in August in an unnamed position in a special projects group.Through July, Carlson was an engineer on Tesla's Autopilot self-driving car program, and before that he worked on automotive vision systems for Michigan-based supplier Gentex Corp.Other Apple hires since September 2014 with similar experience have worked at automakers BMW AG, Volkswagen and Ford Motor Co, automotive suppliers Delphi Automotive, Robert Bosch GmbH and TRW, now a part of ZF Friedrichshafen AG, according to their LinkedIn profiles.Among those hired last fall were Sanjai Massey, an engineer with experience in developing connected and automated vehicles at Ford and several suppliers; Stefan Weber, a former Bosch engineer with experience in video-based driver assistance systems, and Lech Szumilas, a former Delphi research scientist with expertise in computer vision and object detection.

725,"   By Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire Service  Kyle Busch grabs overtime Xfinity win at BristolBy Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed by The Sports XchangeBRISTOL, Tenn. -- When Chris Buescher's Ford faltered on a green-white-checkered restart on Friday night at Bristol Motor Speedway, Kyle Busch took full advantage, as is his custom.In a Food City 300 that went to two laps of overtime at the .533-mile short track, Busch finished .427 of a second ahead of Kyle Larson, as Buescher faded to 11th after his car failed to pick up fuel off Turn 2 of the next-to-last lap.The victory was Busch's third of the season in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, his eighth at Bristol and the 73rd of his career, extending his own series record.""This is home -- this is where I'm supposed to be,"" Busch said, standing outside the car in Victory Lane. ""I wish I was here Wednesday night (after the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series race), so we could continue the sweep lookout for (Saturday), but that was a second place. Oh, well.""Pole-sitter Denny Hamlin ran third, followed by Ty Dillon and Daniel Suarez, who got a bonus for his top-five run. As the highest finishing eligible driver in the Xfinity Dash 4 Cash program, Suarez picked up an extra $100,000.Pit strategy put Buescher at the front of the field under the fourth caution of the race, caused by Cale Conley's spin in Turn 4. On older tires, Buescher nevertheless pulled away from Busch during a succession of restarts, as Busch saved his equipment for what he thought would be the inevitable late-race caution.""I let the 60 (Buescher) go,"" Busch said. ""He ran out there to about a straightaway on us, and I was just trying to save and do what I could to keep my tires underneath me. I knew we were going to get some cautions at the end to bunch us back up, and fortunately we did.""I wasn't sure they were going to make it on fuel (having pitted on lap 131 of 302), and obviously they cut it close -- a little too close.""Busch got the yellow he needed just in time. Brad Teague's wreck on the frontstretch with five laps left set up the green-white-checkered and gave Busch the chance he needed.Buescher, who saw his series lead shrink to 19 points over Ty Dillon, knew he could have made it to the end on fuel had the race not gone to overtime.NASCAR Xfinity Series Race - Food City 300Bristol Motor SpeedwayBristol, TennesseeFriday, August 21, 20151.

726,"   By Aditi Shah | NEW DELHI  NEW DELHI Leading global carmakers are reviewing their blueprint for India to boost sales and avoid more painful cutbacks, after struggling to win over consumers even as the market swings to growth and dominant local players begin to raise prices.    Automakers like General Motors (GM.N), Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) and Renault SA (RENA.PA) have over the past weeks announced hundreds of job losses. Some have already reduced output, and industry analysts expect more to come.Others, like Skoda Auto, part of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), are retreating to their roots - for Skoda, ""premium"" cars.""India is not the most easy market in the world to crack,"" Guillaume Sicard, president of Nissan India told Reuters after the company said it would cut ""hundreds"" of jobs at the Renault-Nissan alliance plant in south India.    The Indian market is showing signs of recovery. After a return to growth in the year to March 2015, this year every month has seen sales improving.But the benefit is being felt mainly by India's dominant players like Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MRTI.NS). Maruti in July reported its market share was once again above 50 percent, its highest in more than a decade.Passenger car sales in India rose 5 percent in the year to end-March, but global carmakers Renault, GM, Volkswagen, Skoda and Ford reported a double-digit decline, industry data showed. In contrast, Maruti and Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) sales rose 11 percent.Now Maruti and Hyundai, India's two best selling brands, are turning up the competitive heat - entering the one segment companies like Renault, Nissan and Ford Motor Co (F.N) had dominated: sport-utility vehicles (SUVs). Maruti recently launched a sedan-SUV crossover and Hyundai, the Creta SUV.NO SALES SURGE Lured by a large customer base and low car penetration, automakers built large capacity in India expecting a surge in sales: India will be the world's No. 3 car market by 2020. Instead, they were undone by their lack of small models, a sparse dealer network and steep aftersales service costs. Nissan introduced its inexpensive Datsun-branded cars last year but failed to ramp up sales given a lack of dealerships in smaller cities, where demand for such cars is high.And consumers' hesitance to make big purchases during a sluggish recovery has made a bad situation worse.""They looked at India as one of the markets they need to be in, but India is a very different kind of market,"" said Abdul Majeed, automotive head at consultant Pwc.""They thought if they bring the car at a good price, people will buy. It is not just about the initial price, it is also fuel efficiency and the whole cost of ownership,"" he said. Nissan and Renault say they will compete with new models, especially small cars, and by growing their dealer network.GM, which announced plans to stop production at one of two plants in the country last month, is betting on 10 new locally-made models over five years.GM will ramp up exports as well, joining Volkswagen and Ford, which are also targeting the domestic market with new compact cars.For Skoda, plans revolve around launching three premium sedans in India next year and increasing the proportion of local engineering to drive down costs.""Multinational companies tend to operate the same way worldwide,"" said Skoda India Chairman Sudhir Rao.""We are trying to develop more of a hybrid approach between Asian engineering and European quality.""

NO SALES SURGE Lured by a large customer base and low car penetration, automakers built large capacity in India expecting a surge in sales: India will be the world's No. 3 car market by 2020.Instead, they were undone by their lack of small models, a sparse dealer network and steep aftersales service costs.Nissan introduced its inexpensive Datsun-branded cars last year but failed to ramp up sales given a lack of dealerships in smaller cities, where demand for such cars is high.And consumers' hesitance to make big purchases during a sluggish recovery has made a bad situation worse. ""They looked at India as one of the markets they need to be in, but India is a very different kind of market,"" said Abdul Majeed, automotive head at consultant Pwc.""They thought if they bring the car at a good price, people will buy. It is not just about the initial price, it is also fuel efficiency and the whole cost of ownership,"" he said.Nissan and Renault say they will compete with new models, especially small cars, and by growing their dealer network.GM, which announced plans to stop production at one of two plants in the country last month, is betting on 10 new locally-made models over five years.GM will ramp up exports as well, joining Volkswagen and Ford, which are also targetting the domestic market with new compact cars.For Skoda, plans revolve around launching three premium sedans in India next year and increasing the proportion of local engineering to drive down costs.""Multinational companies tend to operate the same way worldwide,"" said Skoda India Chairman Sudhir Rao.""We are trying to develop more of a hybrid approach between Asian engineering and European quality.""

728,"   By Jessica Dye  A federal judge in California has dismissed several claims for fraud, breach of contract and breach of warranty from a proposed class action alleging that Ford Motor Co failed to fix defects in vehicle touch-screen control systems, creating a safety hazard for drivers. Monday's ruling is the second time U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in the Northern District of California has partly granted and partly denied Ford's attempts to narrow the scope of the litigation, which seeks to certify nationwide and 12 multi-state classes of Ford customers whose vehicles contained the allegedly defective MyFord Touch systems, as well as variations such as MyLincoln Touch.

729,"  (Adds DesRosiers comment, overall sales data, Toyota numbers)TORONTO, Sept 1 A healthy appetite for light trucks pushed auto sales in Canada to a monthly record in August, with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles nudging out Ford Motor Co as the top seller, according to data released on Thursday.Fiat Chrysler Canadian sales edged up 0.4 percent to take the No.1 spot by 349 units, while Ford's sales fell 5 percent. General Motors Co's sales, meanwhile, jumped a healthy 12 percent.Overall sales nudged 2.2 percent higher to 175,512 cars and light trucks, making it the strongest August on record. Year-to-date sales were up 2.3 percent at 1,285,959 vehicles.The mixed performance came as new data showed the Canadian economy shrank in the second quarter, putting the country in recession as a plunge in oil prices cut investment. But growth picked up in June, underscoring expectations the recession will be short-lived. ""Despite warnings and indeed some recent news stating that the Canadian economy may cool, the appetite for new light vehicles continued to set records in August,"" DesRosiers Automotive Consultants wrote in a note to clients.Light truck sales were up 10 percent, accounting for 60.9 percent of the market in August, with passenger cars making up the remaining 39.1 percent. GM sold 24,653 cars and trucks in Canada, up from 22,111 a year earlier, as truck sales jumped 14.6 percent, and car sales rose 3.2 percent.Ford's Canadian sales fell to 26,581 vehicles, down from 27,969 a year earlier, hurt by declines in both car and truck sales. Fiat Chrysler sold 26,928 cars and trucks in August, up from 26,825 a year earlier. Jeep sales rose 9.2 percent, while Dodge brand truck sales were up 10.1 percent, but Fiat Chrysler's total car sales dropped 19 percent to 2,036 vehicles.U.S. auto sales were stronger than expected in August, boosted by pickup truck and SUV sales. Analysts had expected sales to decline.Toyota Canada, a division of Toyota Motor Corp, said sales were down 1.1 percent at 18,292 vehicles, with lower Toyota and Scion sales outweighing record Lexus sales.Honda Canada, part of Honda Motor Co Ltd, reported an 11 percent increase in sales, to 17,277 vehicles, helped in part by its CR-V crossover utility vehicle.

730,"  MOSCOW U.S. carmaker Ford's (F.N) Russian venture, Ford Sollers, opened a $275 million engine plant on Thursday, which will help make its Russian-produced vehicles less dependent on imported components and currency fluctuations.Ford aims to spend 60 percent of the cost of producing cars for the Russian market in the country itself by 2020, to qualify for benefits such as lower import duties on car components.The new plant, in the republic of Tatarstan, has the capacity to produce up to 105,000 engines a year, with the possibility of expansion to up to 200,000, Ford Sollers said in a statement.At least 30 percent of Russian-built Ford vehicles, including Ford Fiesta, Ford Focus, and Ford EcoSport models, will be equipped with locally built engines, the company said without providing a timeframe.

A Ford representative said the automaker had to reduce its workforce at the factory due to excess capacity in the face of slumping demand, but the company did not confirm the extent of the layoffs. New passenger vehicle sales have fallen more than 20 percent so far this year and heavy truck sales are down nearly 45 percent due to tighter credit, relentless inflation and a sharp economic recession.

734,"   By Zeba Siddiqui | PUNE, India  PUNE, India Automaker Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (MAHM.NS) launched its first new sport utility vehicle (SUV) in three years on Thursday to regain lost market share in a fast-growing but fiercely competitive segment.Mahindra's new compact SUV, named TUV300, is likely to face competition from Renault SA's (RENA.PA) Duster, Ford Motor Co's EcoSport and the Hyundai Motor Co's Creta that have gained popularity, especially in urban India.Annual compact SUV sales in India are likely to rise to 970,000 vehicles by 2020, a four-fold jump from their level a decade ago, as per consultant IHS Automotive, which expects 550,000 such vehicles to be sold in the country in 2015.Mahindra has been losing out on this boom, and now it hopes to reverse the trend with the new vehicle, which was unveiled in the western city of Pune on Thursday, combined with one more compact SUV launch expected later this year.""The total SUV industry in India right now is about 45,000 to 50,000 a  month roughly,"" Pawan Goenka, executive director at Mahindra, said at the launch. ""If this gives us a volume of additional 4,000 to 5,000 per month…then that is 8-10 percent of market share gained.""The starting price for the new vehicle would be 690,000 rupees ($10,379), the company said.The automaker's passenger vehicle sales, dominated by SUVs, fell 12 percent in the year to end March while the industry's passenger vehicle sales rose 4 percent. In the first five months of the current fiscal year that started on April 1, Mahindra's sales fell 8 percent, while industry's passenger vehicle sales rose 7 percent. With more urban Indians choosing global SUV brands for the new technologies and features they offer, Mahindra will need to launch new vehicles and look at pushing deeper into rural areas where it has a stronger hold, analysts said. ""It (TUV300) may help in incremental volumes but regaining market share of the past looks difficult,"" said Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst at IHS. ""They lost it and they may not regain it in near term."" In the year to end-March Mahindra's share of the utility vehicles market fell to 37 percent from 42 percent a year ago, according to industry group Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.In the first three months of the current fiscal year, its share of the utility vehicles market fell 200 basis points from the same period a year ago to 38.5 percent, industry data showed.

735,"  GOTHENBURG, Sweden Geely's Volvo Car Group expects the Chinese roll-out of its new XC90 and, next year, the S90, to drive sales through a slowdown in demand in the world's biggest auto market, its top executive said.Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said Volvo would not join in any price war to prop up volumes as the company tries to make inroads into a high-end car market dominated by German rivals, although some analysts said he may be tempted to cut prices.Samuelsson said Volvo's second model on its new platform, the S90 sedan, which targets a bigger segment of the Chinese market than the XC90 sports utility vehicle, would be launched at the Detroit auto show early 2016.Car sales in China have tumbled in recent months, hit by a slowing economy and slumping equities, highlighting the need among automakers of a fresh model line-up to remain winners in a market unaccustomed to decline. Samuelsson said sales in China would grow in line with a market he expected to be flat or grow only a couple of percent this year. But he said the Swedish carmaker would not participate in increasingly aggressive price competition.""There is a lot of capacity and there will be a lot of people who are tempted to use that capacity and keep their volumes growing,"" said Samuelsson, who also said he had extended his contract as CEO by three years. ""We don't want to take market share just using the price as a weapon ... That will of course also influence exactly what growth rate we will see.""    Chinese sales of Volvos fell 4.1 percent in the year through August. But the XC90 has only now begun reaching dealers there, leaving the carmaker anticipating a boost in its biggest market.

737,"  (Adds analyst comments, context on pressure from non-union U.S. auto plants, background on the two-tier wage issue.)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT, Sept 13 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles   will get the first shot at setting a pattern for wages and benefits for more than 140,000 unionized factory workers at the Detroit Three automakers, the company and the United Auto Workers union said Sunday.The UAW did not elaborate on its decision to choose FCA to set the pattern for new master contracts it will later negotiate with General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.FCA Executive Sergio Marchionne has been the most vocal among Detroit CEOs in calling for an end to the current wage system under which recently-hired UAW workers earn about 40 percent less per hour than union veterans on the assembly line.UAW leaders have called for narrowing or eliminating the pay gap, pointing to the robust profits rolling in from sales of the trucks and sport utility vehicles UAW members build.If FCA and the UAW cannot come to terms, the union could order strikes, potentially hobbling FCA's production of its highest-profit U.S. models. The UAW's lead negotiator at Chrysler, Norwood Jewell, has said in messages to members that job security and pay increases are his top priorities.Looming over the UAW's negotiations with FCA, GM and Ford are the growing number of U.S. auto plant workers who are not members of the union and work for European and Asian automakers in the southern United States.The more flexible work rules at non-union factories, and in certain cases lower wages and benefits, could put limits on the UAW's aspirations, analysts said.Contracts for all three Detroit automakers expire late Monday night. ""All three companies are working hard toward a collective bargaining agreement. At this time, the UAW has selected FCA US LLC (the U.S. unit of Fiat Chrysler) to be the lead bargaining company,"" Dennis Williams, president of the UAW, said in an emailed statement.FCA officials had no comment other than to confirm the company is the lead in ongoing talks. Ford and GM said Sunday they will continue their negotiations.The selection of FCA is a setback for GM and Ford, but Kristin Dziczek, labor analyst at Center for Automotive Research, said the two larger companies ""are not going to choke on a Fiat Chrysler pattern."" The two-tier pay system is one of several, interlocking issues on the table between the UAW and FCA. Currently, veteran UAW workers make about $28 per hour, while newly-hired workers make between $15.78 and $19.28 per hour.Marchionne has said he would consider a deal that lets current top-tier workers keep their higher pay rates during a transition to a new system under which all workers would make the same basic hourly wage. Marchionne has indicated he would set that base rate below the current top tier, but offer the potential for larger profit-sharing checks when times are good.""I firmly believe in wealth distribution,"" Marchionne said in July when the talks formally started.About 45 percent of FCA's hourly U.S. workforce of about 36,000 earn second-tier pay, while at Ford lower-paid workers account for 28 percent and at GM 20 percent.The automakers and the union have said they are discussing a cost-saving healthcare collective that would pool all 142,000 active UAW members at the Detroit Three into a single plan. Adding UAW retirees to the pool would mean a collective about 1 million strong with considerable bargaining power.Ford, GM and FCA say they must protect against a downturn in a cyclical industry. But the cost of labor is less and less important to a vehicle's overall cost, according to economist Sean McAlinden of the Center for Automotive Research. Labor's share of vehicle price for the Detroit Three last year was 6.7 percent, down from 15 percent in 2008, he said.

738,"   By Reid Spencer  Field set for Chase for CupBy Reid SpencerNASCAR Wire ServiceDistributed for The Sports XchangeRICHMOND, Va. -- Joe Gibbs Racing brought guns to a knife fight on Saturday night at Richmond International Raceway.But JGR's Matt Kenseth did his teammates one better -- he brought a howitzer.Leading 352 of 400 laps in a race he owned from the outset, Kenseth pulled away from Kyle Busch after a restart with 18 laps left and won the Federated Auto Parts 400 by .951 seconds over his teammate.Kenseth's fourth victory of the season, tying him for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series lead with Jimmie Johnson and Busch, meant the 16 drivers who started the race in playoff-eligible positions stayed there.Jamie McMurray (13th-place finisher), Jeff Gordon (seventh), Ryan Newman (20th), Clint Bowyer (10th) and Paul Menard (26th) all earned berths in the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup based on position in the standings - without a victory between them.Joey Logano ran third on Saturday night, followed by Aric Almirola, whose gallant bid to crack the Chase grid fell 17 points short of the final position claimed by Menard.Dale Earnhardt Jr. came home fifth.The victory was Kenseth's second at Richmond and the 35th of his career. Joe Gibbs Racing has won seven of the last nine NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races, with Logano the only other driver to score a win during that stretch.""Man, these guys gave me a great car,"" Kenseth said. ""Thanks to (crew chief) Jason (Ratcliff) and all these guys standing behind me. They had the pit stops we needed, held serve every time and kept us out in front.""We were really superb in the long run. I had to work for it pretty hard in the short run. I was disappointed to see that last caution (called for debris on the backstretch on Lap 375). I knew it was going to be tough, but we were able to get the jump to get out front.""Emblematic of JGR's dominance at Richmond was a restart on Lap 126.Hamlin surged from fourth to first on the restart lap, pulling his three teammates with him. The four Gibbs cars quickly separated from fifth-place Kyle Larson, establishing a gap of two seconds back to the No. 42.Kenseth overtook Hamlin for the top spot on Lap 139, but for 60 straight laps the JGR teammates ran 1-2-3-4, until McMurray (who had qualified for the Chase simply by taking the green flag to start the race) passed Carl Edwards for the fourth position on Lap 186.The only suspense during that stretch came when Kenseth and Edwards rubbed fenders while fighting for position early in the run.That brief fracas gave team owner Joe Gibbs an anxious moment.""That's the most nervous that I get in a race,"" Gibbs said. ""Tonight I saw them up there. I saw some beating and banging there. I saw a hand come out the window, and I wasn't sure what it was showing for a minute or two. I got a little nervous there.""I think that's when I'm always the most nervous, when you got your cars up front and having a good night. Our guys, though, I think they all handled it the right way, it seems like. I know Matt came over the mic there and said his situation there with Carl, he kind of straightened that out, so I thought that was good.""Logano was the only non-JGR driver who could stay within hailing distance of Kenseth, but the ultimate third-place finisher stayed out on old tires for that restart on Lap 126 and did a creditable job holding the 10th spot before the fourth caution on Lap 209 gave him a chance to pit for fresh rubber.Almirola posted his best finish of the year, but it wasn't enough.""I'm really proud of all my guys,"" Almirola said. ""We worked our guts out all year long, and tonight was no different. I feel we've overachieved this year and really maximized our results week in and week out.""I'm disappointed to come up a few spots short, but we gave it all we had, and that is all we can do. We'll go race these last 10 races and try to get a victory.""Notes: Roush Fenway Racing failed to place a car in the Chase for the first time in the organization's history. ... McMurray and Menard earned Chase positions for the first time in their careers. ... Newman made the Chase without a victory for the second straight year. ... In his final season as a full-time Sprint Cup driver, Gordon qualified for his 11th Chase in 12 tries. ... The most bizarre moment of the race went to Michael McDowell, who grazed a safety truck in Turn 3 as the cars circulated under caution and ripped the right rear quarter panel off his car.NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Race -- Federated Auto Parts 400 Richmond International RacewayRichmond, VirginiaSaturday, Sept. 12, 20151.

739,"  (Adds details of Danieli Group licensing agreement, company comments)By Nick CareyCHICAGO, Sept 14 Ford Motor Co will begin in the fourth quarter to use multiple components in its high-selling F-150 pickup model made from an advanced Alcoa Inc  aluminum alloy that is tough enough to replace steel parts yet significantly lighter, both companies said on Monday.The two corporations also announced a joint development agreement to collaborate on using next-generation aluminum produced through Alcoa's new ""Micromill"" process in other vehicles.The deal with the automaker is a high-profile first for Alcoa's Micromill - Ford's F-Series pickup trucks have been the best-selling model in the United States since 1982. The full-size pickup truck is a key profit generator for the No. 2 U.S. automaker. Automakers have turned to lighter aluminum alloys instead of high-strength steel, which is far heavier, to build more fuel-efficient vehicles that still meet safety standards.Last year, Ford rolled out its 2015 F-150 with an aluminum alloy body that made it 700 pounds (320 kg)lighter than earlier models, boosting fuel efficiency.""The fact that is one of the crown jewels of the company shows our faith in the (Micromill) technology,"" Ford chief technology officer Raj Nair told Reuters. The first components using the new aluminum alloy will appear in the 2016 year model F-150, including for the tailgate and the bed of the pickup truck, adding to the vehicle's towing and hauling capabilities, Nair said. Micromill will be used to make more parts in more Ford vehicle platforms in years to come.The alloy is part of New York-based Alcoa's strategy of investing in more advanced aerospace and automotive products while selling off some of its more traditional yet costly smelting facilities. The metals firm is in talks with eight other automakers on using Micromill technology. Unveiled by Alcoa in December, Micromill produces high-strength aluminum alloy that goes from molten metal to cooled, coiled metal in 20 minutes versus the 20 days it takes to roll conventional aluminum.The alloy is 30 percent stronger that regular aluminum and 40 percent more formable, meaning it can be shaped into more intricate forms, including inside car door panels or fenders.In a separate announcement, Alcoa said it had agreed to license intellectual property associated with Micromill's alloys and process technology to Italy's Danieli Group.Alcoa will also grant Danieli exclusive rights to sell Micromill equipment for a limited period, targeting potential customers in Europe, South America and Southeast Asia.

743,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) will get the first shot at setting a pattern for wages and benefits for more than 140,000 unionized factory workers at the Detroit Three automakers, the company and the United Auto Workers union said Sunday.The UAW did not elaborate on its decision to choose FCA to set the pattern for new master contracts it will later negotiate with General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N). FCA Executive Sergio Marchionne has been the most vocal among Detroit CEOs in calling for an end to the current wage system under which recently-hired UAW workers earn about 40 percent less per hour than union veterans on the assembly line. UAW leaders have called for narrowing or eliminating the pay gap, pointing to the robust profits rolling in from sales of the trucks and sport utility vehicles UAW members build.If FCA and the UAW cannot come to terms, the union could order strikes, potentially hobbling FCA's production of its highest-profit U.S. models. The UAW's lead negotiator at Chrysler, Norwood Jewell, has said in messages to members that job security and pay increases are his top priorities.Looming over the UAW's negotiations with FCA, GM and Ford are the growing number of U.S. auto plant workers who are not members of the union and work for European and Asian automakers in the southern United States.  The more flexible work rules at non-union factories, and in certain cases lower wages and benefits, could put limits on the UAW's aspirations, analysts said. Contracts for all three Detroit automakers expire late Monday night.“All three companies are working hard toward a collective bargaining agreement. At this time, the UAW has selected FCA US LLC (the U.S. unit of Fiat Chrysler) to be the lead bargaining company,” Dennis Williams, president of the UAW, said in an emailed statement.FCA officials had no comment other than to confirm the company is the lead in ongoing talks. Ford and GM said Sunday they will continue their negotiations. The selection of FCA is a setback for GM and Ford, but Kristin Dziczek, labor analyst at Center for Automotive Research, said the two larger companies ""are not going to choke on a Fiat Chrysler pattern.""The two-tier pay system is one of several, interlocking issues on the table between the UAW and FCA. Currently, veteran UAW workers make about $28 per hour, while newly-hired workers make between $15.78 and $19.28 per hour.Marchionne has said he would consider a deal that lets current top-tier workers keep their higher pay rates during a transition to a new system under which all workers would make the same basic hourly wage. Marchionne has indicated he would set that base rate below the current top tier, but offer the potential for larger profit-sharing checks when times are good. ""I firmly believe in wealth distribution,"" Marchionne said in July when the talks formally started. About 45 percent of FCA's hourly U.S. workforce of about 36,000 earn second-tier pay, while at Ford lower-paid workers account for 28 percent and at GM 20 percent.The automakers and the union have said they are discussing a cost-saving healthcare collective that would pool all 142,000 active UAW members at the Detroit Three into a single plan. Adding UAW retirees to the pool would mean a collective about 1 million strong with considerable bargaining power.Ford, GM and FCA say they must protect against a downturn in a cyclical industry. But the cost of labor is less and less important to a vehicle's overall cost, according to economist Sean McAlinden of the Center for Automotive Research. Labor's share of vehicle price for the Detroit Three last year was 6.7 percent, down from 15 percent in 2008, he said.

Veteran UAW workers, who make about $28 per hour, have not had a wage hike in a decade.

Those workers have pushed UAW leaders to narrow that gap or set a clear path to eliminating it. At FCA, about 45 percent of the hourly UAW workers earn lower-tier wages. The surge in profits for the once-struggling Detroit automakers, FCA, Ford Motor Co (F.N) and General Motors Co (GM.N) has also fed pressure from rank-and-file UAW members for substantial raises. FCA’s North American operating profit in the second quarter reported on July 30 was $1.35 billion, up 37 percent from the previous year.If the UAW secured significant pay hikes it could help the union's efforts to organize non-union auto plants in the southern United States, and possibly embolden workers in other industries where pay has stagnated in the face of economic uncertainty and global competition.“The stakes go well beyond Detroit and the automotive industry,"" said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the University of California-Berkeley. Williams had also pushed publicly for the automakers to consider a proposal to pool their respective company health plans into a single group to curb rising costs.

748,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT, Sept 28  DETROIT, Sept 28 United Auto Workers union members at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's   U.S. factories are increasingly rejecting a proposed national labor agreement recommended by union leaders, expressing discontent with a compromise that sacrificed larger wage hikes for future investment in U.S. operations.By Monday, two large UAW locals in Kokomo, Indiana, and Detroit had resoundingly rejected the tentative agreement, joining the wave against the deal in previous votes by workers at several Michigan plants. The latest rejection was by 77 percent of production workers in Kokomo and 64 percent at the Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Detroit.Even if the contract is ratified, UAW and company leaders will have to work with a sizable cohort of workers who believe they are not getting a fair deal.Labor experts say they cannot remember a full national contract ever being rejected. If the proposed contract is rejected, the union could renew talks with Fiat Chrysler, strike at the company's plants, or turn attention to General Motors Co or Ford Motor Co .The proposed deal reached on Sept. 15 by UAW and Fiat Chrysler negotiators would narrow but not close a pay gap between first-tier workers who currently make about $28 per hour and second-tier workers who now top out around $19 per hour. Fiat Chrysler has the highest share of second-tier workers, 45 percent of its production workforce, and therefore has lower labor costs. Ford and GM negotiators will want to narrow if not eliminate this labor cost advantage for Fiat Chrysler. About 28 percent of workers are Ford and 20 percent at GM are in the lower tier.Union workers voting Monday through Wednesday include those at Fiat Chrysler plants in Toledo, Ohio, in Sterling Heights and Warren in Michigan and in Belvidere, Illinois. There is uncertainty about product plans at those plants, which raises questions about job security. A UAW spokesman declined to comment until all plants had voted. A Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman also declined to comment.Bill Parker, a 41-year production worker at Fiat Chrysler, said workers had expected the company and the union to adhere to an agreement made in 2009 that a 25 percent cap on the number of second-tier workers would be enacted in 2015. Doing so would have increased wages dramatically for 20 percent of Fiat Chrysler's workers.Arthur Schwartz, a labor consultant, said: ""If the reason for the rejection is the cap, then we are going back to Square One. It really behooves the UAW to get this deal ratified.""

753,"   By Sweta Singh  U.S. auto sales surged in September to their strongest in more than a decade, with the Detroit Three clocking double-digit growth as cheap gasoline and ultra-low interest rates drove demand for sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks.Sales also got a boost from the calendar, with the entire Labor Day weekend falling in September for the first time since 2012. The holiday weekend is traditionally important for sales.Total vehicle sales for the month shot up 15.8 percent from a year earlier to 1.44 million cars and light trucks, equal to a seasonally adjusted annual rate, or SAAR, of 18.17 million, according to research firm Autodata Corp.That topped estimates for a SAAR of 17.6 million and was the highest since the 20.6 million clocked in July 2005.At this pace, the U.S. auto industry is on track to challenge the record for full-year sales of 17.8 million vehicles set in 2000.The big three U.S. automakers - General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and the U.S. operations of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU.N) - all reported strong sales at a time when automakers are struggling with slowing demand in China and other markets.Car sales in China, until recently the profit engine for automakers around the world, have been hit by a cooling economy and a plunging stock market.GM, the largest U.S. automaker, said its total sales in September rose about 12 percent to 251,310 vehicles compared with the same month last year.

Ford Motor Co said on Thursday its U.S. sales rose 23 percent in September, the best level since 2004, while General Motors said its total sales rose 12 percent.Palladium is chiefly used in autocatalysts for gasoline engines, while platinum is mainly used in autocatalysts for diesel engines.The strong car demand is seen as bullish for palladium, though platinum is still suffering after Volkswagen's  emissions scandal last week raised concerns about diesel engine demand. ""Strong vehicle sales across the board, ex VW, helped palladium today,"" said Tai Wong, director of base and precious metals trading for BMO Capital Markets.

764,"  (Adds comments from labor professor, paragraphs 10-11)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT Oct 6 United Auto Workers members are planning to strike at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV   U.S. plants as soon as Wednesday evening, the first work stoppage since 2007, threatening to bring manufacturing to a halt.A strike at its U.S. operations could cost the automaker $40 million a week in operating profit, said Sean McAlinden, chief economist with the Center for Automotive Research.Workers at several plants in Kokomo, Indiana, and at least one in Michigan received notices to be ready to strike but it was not clear whether all Fiat Chrysler plants would be involved.Kristin Dziczek, labor analyst with the Center for Automotive Research, said the last time the UAW took the company, then known as Chrysler, out on strike it was a ""Hollywood strike,"" as in ""just for show"" in 2007. That strike, in the second week of October, lasted six hours.The strike weapon was not available to the UAW until this year for Fiat Chrysler or General Motors Co as part of the 2009 government-sponsored bankruptcies at those companies.The UAW must balance the need to make a forceful statement to Fiat Chrysler with concerns it could substantially hurt the company, the weakest of the Big Three, which would be bad for its own members and hopes of growth.Arthur Schwartz, a labor consultant and former negotiator with GM, said, ""This is the union's play now. It is up to them what happens.""Schwartz said UAW President Dennis Williams would not want a lengthy strike because of the pain it could inflict on his members and the harm to Fiat Chrysler.

766,"  * UAW has said will terminate current contract at midnight* Tentative contract was rejected by union members last week* Would be first Detroit automotive strike since 2007* Company could lose $1 bln of revenue per week -analyst   (Adds number of workers who could be affected by strike, details on contract sticking points, updates share price)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT, Oct 7 With a threatened strike hanging over them, negotiators from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV   and the United Auto Workers union continued to meet on Wednesday afternoon, a Fiat Chrysler spokeswoman said.The U.S. union on Tuesday called for a strike against Fiat Chrysler's U.S. operations at 11:59 p.m. EDT on Wednesday (0359 GMT Thursday) unless a new agreement on a four-year contract is reached.There are 40,000 Fiat Chrysler UAW workers who could strike. A union spokesman gave no details of the talks including whether the company was willing to sweeten the deal it offered the UAW that was approved Sept. 18 by the union leaders but rejected last week by 65 percent of its rank-and-file Fiat Chrysler membership.Workers have said they turned down the contract because many wanted a two-tier wage and benefit system eliminated. Short of that, they sought a cap on that lower-paid second tier at 25 percent of the total union workforce. Many workers also wish to undo some of the concessions they have given since 2007 to keep the company competitive.The last time the UAW called a strike against Detroit automakers, who currently make up about 37 percent of the union's membership, was in 2007 at Chrysler and General Motors Co. GM and Chrysler were prohibited from striking until this year as part of the 2009 bailout agreement with the U.S. government.Sean McAlinden, economist with the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan, estimated that Fiat Chrysler could lose $40 million of operating profit and at least $1 billion of revenue weekly in a strike of all its U.S. production plants. That calculation uses an estimated per-vehicle profit of about $1,100 in the first half of the year. The company's U.S. production plants are concentrated in the U.S. Midwest, in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Illinois.McAlinden and other labor analysts have suggested for months that the UAW could cripple the company's production by striking at four transmission plants and a castings plant that feeds them in the Kokomo-Tipton area in Indiana.Such a move would within days slow and then stop production at company assembly plants in Michigan, Ohio and Illinois, including the plant that makes the profitable Jeep Wrangler in Toledo, Ohio.A strike would occur as the U.S. auto industry is at its highest mark in a decade, and as Fiat Chrysler is enjoying an  ongoing streak of 66 months with year-over-year sales gains. Fiat Chrysler is the No. 4 automaker in the U.S. market as measured in sales, behind GM, Ford Motor Co, and Toyota Motor Corp. It represents about 12.4 percent of U.S. auto sales, up from less than 9 percent when Fiat and its CEO, Sergio Marchionne, took control of Chrysler in 2009.Fiat Chrysler's minivan plant in Windsor, Ontario, which is across the river from Detroit, would also be affected within days of a strike at U.S. plants, the president of the Canadian union, Unifor, told the Windsor Star newspaper. Unifor represents autoworkers at Fiat Chrysler, GM and Ford.Jerry Dias, Unifor president, told the Windsor Star that a stoppage at the Kokomo-Tipton plants would affect Fiat Chrysler plants in Windsor and Brampton, Ontario, ""within a day.""Art Wheaton of the Worker Institute at Cornell University said that a short-term strike could help the UAW leadership prove to the rank and file that it is being tough with Fiat Chrysler, which he said matters because of some worker perceptions that the union and company are too close.""A short-term strike gives the members the message that 'We took it as far as we could at the table and if you want to get more, you are going to have to live on the strike pay but remember that every minute you are on strike is a dollar that Fiat Chrysler is not going to have to afford to pay you,'"" said Wheaton.He referred to the $200-per-week strike pay that UAW members will receive, which they do not earn until the strike goes into its second week. Workers do not receive their first strike pay until a strike reaches its third week.Fiat Chrysler shares were up 3.2 percent at $14.71 in New York on Wednesday afternoon.

767,"  * UAW Chrysler Council will meet on Friday to vote on agreement* Tentative contract was rejected by union members last week* Talks went down to the midnight deadline   (Adds reaction to tentative deal, UAW member comments, background)By Bernie Woodall and Nick CareyDETROIT/KOKOMO, Ind., Oct 8 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  and the United Auto Workers said on Thursday they had reached a new tentative four-year labor agreement that averted a threatened strike of the automaker's U.S. operations.The agreement must be ratified by a vote of Fiat Chrysler's 40,000 union workers in the United States. A previous proposed contract was rejected by rank and file UAW workers at Fiat Chrysler in voting late last month.Carl Durham, 45, a UAW worker at Fiat Chrysler's transmission plant in Kokomo, Ind., said his support for the new contract would depend on whether it did more than the previous deal to narrow or eliminate the roughly $9-an-hour gap in pay between veteran workers and more recent hires. He said he voted against the previous agreement. ""I want to know all the details and what everyone is going to get, not a lot of ifs,"" he said.Neither the union nor the company disclosed details of the new tentative pact. It's not clear whether Fiat Chrysler will spend more than it would have under the proposal it offered the UAW last month.Workers have said they turned down the previous contract because many wanted a two-tier wage and benefit system eliminated. Short of that, they sought a cap on that lower-paid second tier at 25 percent of the total union workforce. Many workers also wish to undo some of the concessions they have given since 2007 to keep the company competitive. If this agreement is ratified, the UAW will try to use the pact as a template for negotiations with the U.S. operations of General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co.The UAW Chrysler Council will meet in Detroit at 11 am EDT/1600 GMT on Friday to discuss the agreement and vote on it, the union said.The previous proposed agreement would have narrowed the gap between the pay of veteran UAW workers, who earn about $28 an hour, and more recent hires, who are paid about $19 an hour. This two-tier wage system, which the UAW agreed to in stages over the past decade as the Detroit automakers grappled with grave financial losses, has become a focus of discontent among many UAW members who want all workers to be paid the top tier wage. Aaron McCune, 21, a recent hire at the Kokomo complex who makes $15.78 an hour, said he was concerned the previous proposed contract was unclear, especially about health insurance. ""But I have a family to feed and I can't get by without a job. I would have gone on strike, but I'm happy I get to keep on working,"" he said early Thursday.The previous agreement was opposed by 65 percent of Fiat Chrysler's UAW workers, even though the company promised $5.3 billion in investment in UAW-represented plants during the four-year life of the contract. UAW workers said the investment promises were not specific, and also questioned proposed changes to their healthcare plans.The UAW's decision, for the second time, to try to avoid a strike at Fiat Chrysler highlights the continued threat to UAW jobs, despite the robust recovery of the U.S. automakers since the financial crisis of 2008-2009. The sudden collapse in U.S. auto sales during that period forced the former Chrysler and GM into government-funded bankruptcies, while Ford undertook a painful, self-financed restructuring.Now, the Detroit automakers are making strong profits, though Fiat Chrysler's U.S. operations are the weakest financially of the Detroit Three. Further, the UAW remains under pressure from the threat that the automakers could move more jobs to lower cost Mexico or overseas. Fiat Chrysler and Ford have both signaled plans to shift production of certain models to Mexico, UAW members have said.U.S. labor unions have launched fewer than 20 major strikes in each year from 2008 to 2014, according to the U.S. Labor Department. In 1979, U.S. unions launched 235 major strikes. The number of strikes started to fall dramatically after 1981, when then-President Ronald Reagan fired U.S. air traffic controllers who had gone on strike. During the subsequent years, U.S. companies moved to relocate jobs overseas or to states with weak unions.

776,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT The United Auto Workers union said on Thursday that its members ratified a four-year labor contract with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  by an overwhelming majority, after rejecting a previous contract proposal last month.The new contract will be used as a basic pattern for contracts at U.S. automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co. The UAW is expected to soon name the company with which it negotiates next.The new contract, effective as of next Monday, provides a clearer path to top pay for so-called ""second-tier"" workers in a two-tier wage system established in 2007, which pays newer workers less than those hired before 2007.Approved by a 77 percent majority, it will affect 40,000 Fiat Chrysler UAW members in the United States. GM and Ford each have about 52,700 UAW-represented workers. Fiat Chrysler said the new contract ""represents an investment in our U.S. workforce and recognizes its contributions to the company's growth over the past six years.""UAW members sacrificed gains in a 2011 contract and two years earlier made concessions to allow the former Chrysler to go through bankruptcy and come out partially owned and fully managed by the former Fiat. Fiat and Chrysler merged in 2014.The company is now profitable, but not nearly as much as GM or Ford. Ford and GM executives have recently said that their profits are not excessive and they will not allow labor costs to go up to the point that they are not competitive with foreign automakers with U.S. plants or with crosstown rival Fiat Chrysler. Fiat Chrysler's labor costs have been lower than either GM of Ford because it has more lower-paid recent hires, at about 45 percent. Ford has about 29 percent ""second-tier"" workers and GM has about 20 percent.UAW leaders have rallied members this year by saying ""this is our time"" to reap rewards after rounds of concessionary contracts since 2007 when the Detroit Three automakers were reeling financially. GM on Wednesday announced a record pre-tax profit of $3.1 billion, and an operating North American profit margin so far this year of 10.5 percent.Ford, which reports its third-quarter results on Tuesday,  made a profit of $6.9 billion last year, and a second-quarter pre-tax profit of $2.9 billion.Some 72 percent of GM's revenue in the third quarter came from North America, where UAW-made products are its biggest sellers.",2015-10-22,F,"Thu Oct 22, 2015 | 1:45pm EDT","With Fiat Chrysler pact approved, UAW now eyes GM and Ford",http://www.reuters.com//article/autos-uaw-idUSL1N12M1WE20151022?type=companyNews
777,"  (Recasts with union choosing to negotiate with GM next)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT Oct 22 The United Auto Workers said on Thursday it will negotiate its next deal with General Motors Co , after the union's workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  ratified a new pact.The contract reached with Fiat Chrysler will be used as a basic pattern for deals the union will attempt to reach first with GM and later with Ford Motor Co. The UAW announced earlier Thursday the Fiat Chrysler deal for 40,000 workers had been ratified by 77 percent of those who voted.While the Fiat Chrysler pact sets the pattern, GM workers and the UAW are going to expect a richer deal because GM is more profitable, said labor analyst Arthur Schwartz. GM and Ford each have about 52,700 UAW-represented workers. ""(UAW President) Dennis Williams has already said it's going to be Chrysler-plus at GM and Ford,"" said Schwartz, a former negotiator for GM.GM has highlighted its improving financial situation and rosy outlook since an Oct. 1 meeting with Wall Street analysts.And on Wednesday, it reported record quarterly profit, derived almost entirely from its home in North America where vehicles made by UAW members are its top sellers. However, GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra and Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens have made clear that no deal with the UAW will threaten its maintaining 10 percent operating profit margins in North America, which it will achieve this year.GM has already committed to invest $5.4 billion over the next three years in U.S. manufacturing and on Thursday said it will add 1,200 workers and a second shift at its last remaining production plant in Detroit, where the company is headquartered. GM negotiators are expected to remind the UAW that its labor costs are higher than Fiat Chrysler's in large part because it has hired fewer lower-paid workers since 2007, when the union and the Detroit Three automakers agreed to a two-tier wage structure as all of the companies were reeling financially.The new Fiat Chrysler contract, effective as of next Monday, provides a clearer path to top pay for so-called ""second-tier"" workers.Fiat Chrysler's labor costs have been lower than either GM or Ford because it has more lower-paid recent hires, at about 45 percent. Ford has about 29 percent ""second-tier"" workers and GM has about 20 percent.(Additional reporting by Joseph White; Editing by Tom Brown and Lisa Shumaker)",2015-10-22,F,"Thu Oct 22, 2015 | 4:38pm EDT",UPDATE 3-UAW picks GM for U.S. autoworker talks after Fiat Chrysler deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/autos-uaw-idUSL1N12M1TM20151022?type=companyNews
778,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT United Auto Workers union members showed overwhelming support in early voting returns on Wednesday night for a proposed four-year labor contract with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI), according to local union hall websites.The UAW is expected to issue on Thursday the final results of the ratification vote on the deal, which will set the tone for upcoming negotiations with General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N).Large local union halls in Kokomo, Indiana, and Belvidere, Illinois, supported the deal by more than 80 percent, according to their respective websites. Together, the plants in Kokomo and Belvidere have nearly a third of the 40,000 Fiat Chrysler UAW members.These results, combined with results from local halls in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Indiana reported by the Detroit Free Press and Detroit News showed widespread and overwhelming support for the new Fiat Chrysler contract.Last month, a previous proposed contract was rejected by 65 percent of Fiat Chrysler workers who voted. If the contract is ratified, the UAW is expected to soon announce whether it will try to reach the next deal with either GM or Ford.""I voted for it. The membership told (UAW leaders) to address the wage and equity issues and they did, which surprised me,"" said Bill Parker, a worker at the suburban Detroit plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan. The new contract offers a clearer path to top pay for so-called ""second-tier"" workers in a two-tier wage system established in 2007 that pays newer workers less than those hired before 2007.The new contract calls for the reshaping of worker pay so that a new hire will make $17 per hour and advance to top pay, which under the new pact is about $30 per hour, over eight years. Since 2007, new hires have not had a clear path toward top pay.Top pay for those hired after 2007 was raised to nearly $30 per hour in the new deal, up from $25 per hour in the rejected contract. The new contract also eliminated a proposed healthcare pool of workers of all three Detroit automakers that many workers found confusing.The union truncated voting to two days rather than have it extend over a week or more, and it repackaged the proposed contract with the help of a public relations firm.

The average transaction price for an F-series truck rose about $2,000 to $42,000 in the latest quarter, Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said. Of Ford's $35.8 billion in automotive revenue, 66 percent was derived from North America in the quarter.Ford and the United Auto Workers will soon begin contract negotiations in which the union is expected to push for a greater share of profits.Once-promising emerging markets such as Brazil have turned into money losers for Ford and GM. But Shanks said the company remained optimistic about China, and forecast a record fourth quarter in its Asia-Pacific operations. The No. 2 U.S. automaker reaffirmed its forecast for pre-tax profit of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion for the full year, and said profit margins in North America would be at the upper end of a previous forecast of 8.5 percent to 9.5 percent. Through the first nine months of the year, Ford's North American profit margin was 9.9 percent. GM posted a 10.5 percent margin in the same period. For the latest quarter, Ford reported pre-tax profit of $2.7 billion in North America, lifting profit margins to 11.3 percent in large part because of strong sales of its F-series large pickup truck line.  The pre-tax profit for the full company was the same, $2.7 billion.Outside of North America, Ford lost $340 million before taxes, although the company said losses in Europe and South America were narrowing.Quarterly revenue was $38.1 billion, up $3.2 billion from a year ago despite the impact of a stronger dollar.Shanks said vehicle sales in China would be unchanged for the year at 24 million, better than most analysts had expected a few months ago.

796,"  (Adds details, analysts' comments)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT Nov 5 United Auto Workers members at the General Motors Co truck plant in Fort Wayne, Indiana, approved a new four-year contract by a wide margin, joining momentum in favor of the deal as voting continues on Thursday.The president of the UAW local in Fort Wayne said on Thursday morning that the vote was 1,839 to 1,311 in favor at the plant, which makes GM pickup trucks.Fort Wayne joined large plants in Wentzville, Missouri, and Spring Hill, Tennessee, which approved the new contract on Wednesday night. At least 60 percent of production workers at the two plants favored the deal, local media and social media posts show. Analysts said the contract appeared on its way to passage, but were cautious about declaring it would pass.Most large GM plants had finished voting, but those in Lansing, Michigan, and Lordstown, Ohio, had not.Negotiators for Ford Motor Co continued to meet with UAW representatives but had not begun discussions on the final economic aspects of a contract, said people familiar with the talks. It is widely believed that the final push to nail down a contract at Ford would not begin until after GM's ratification vote. The UAW is not expected to announce the final tally of the GM vote until the weekend. The union and company reached a deal on the contract on Oct. 25.Kristin Dziczek, labor analyst with the Center for Automotive Research, said that overall, workers appeared on their way to passing the deal. Production workers are in favor, while the fewer skilled-trade workers at major plants have opposed the deal. Dziczek said skilled-trade workers were rejecting the overall deal in part because they are ineligible for a $60,000 early retirement incentive under the proposed contract. GM will pay out that incentive to as many as 4,000 UAW production workers.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  in September  overwhelmingly rejected the first negotiated proposal but approved the second one, which took effect last week.The Fiat Chrysler deal set an eight-year path from hiring to top pay, which goes from $17 per hour to nearly $30. It provided ratification bonuses of $3,000 to workers hired after 2007 and $4,000 to those hired before then.GM's proposed pact has the same eight-year path for workers hired after 2007 to reach top pay, along with a richer ratification bonus of $8,000.

The UAW and Ford did not disclose details of the products, but several sources with knowledge of Ford's plans say they expect a midsize pickup truck and a sport utility vehicle reminiscent of the former Bronco SUV.Focus production is expected to move to Mexico, UAW officials and analysts have said. The union and the company didn't confirm that Monday. The UAW's Ford leaders on Monday approved the tentative agreement and send it on to a worker ratification vote. No specific timing for the vote was set, a UAW spokesman said.

805,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Nov 9 Ford Motor Co's $9 billion investment plan for its U.S. operations includes two new products for a Michigan plant that will lose production of small cars, and U.S. production of a new Lincoln luxury sedan, a proposed four-year contract with the United Auto Workers shows, the UAW said on Monday.Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, a Detroit suburb, will get an unidentified new model by 2018 and a second ""no later than 2020,"" a UAW summary of its new contract with Ford states.The UAW and Ford did not disclose details of the products, but several sources with knowledge of Ford's plans say they expect a midsize pickup truck and a sport utility vehicle reminiscent of the former Bronco SUV.Focus production is expected to move to Mexico, UAW officials and analysts have said. The union and the company didn't confirm that Monday. The UAW's Ford leaders on Monday approved the tentative agreement and send it on to a worker ratification vote. No specific timing for the vote was set, a UAW spokesman said.In another sign of the shift in U.S. car-buying tastes toward SUVs and trucks, the Ford contract suggests the Ford Taurus, a large sedan, could be phased out. The car will be produced at the Chicago Assembly Plant ""through its product life cycle,"" according to the UAW summary.

806,"  NEW YORK Nov 9 Novelis Inc, the world's largest rolled aluminum producer, warned on Monday that plans to shift rolling mill capacity to automotive body sheet are progressing slower than anticipated as carmakers prove slow to follow Ford's lead in widespread use of the metal.Novelis Chief Executive Steve Fisher said the industry is going through a ""digestion period"" after Ford Motor Co  said it would use an aluminum body in its top-selling F-150 model. Other automobile manufacturers have not followed with similar major commitments for leading models.""While Ford has gone very aluminum-intensive and been very successful with the F-150 more recently, everyone's going to look at their portfolios of vehicles and take their own views on how quickly they need to move to aluminum,"" Fisher said during the company's second-quarter earnings call for its fiscal year 2016.The U.S. aluminum industry, including producers like Alcoa Inc, are bullish on rising demand from the auto industry as carmakers seek to move away from steel, which is heavier, in order to comply with new emissions standards.That comes as aluminum beverage can sheet demand, Novelis' largest end-use market, is shrinking as consumers move away from fizzy drinks due to health concerns. Fisher said that market is contracting around 1 percent annually. Downstream fabricators like Novelis have responded by shifting rolling mill capacity away from beverage sheet production and toward auto body sheet production.Atlanta-based Novelis has said overcapacity in the North American can sheet market would fall as rolled aluminum products makers shift more capacity toward automotive products. The company previously has said it would consider shifting capacity at its Logan, Kentucky mill, which supplies more than one-third of the total U.S. can sheet market, toward supplying the auto industry.But Fisher said on Monday that Novelis was not participating in an investment announced last month to expand capacity at the Logan, Kentucky mill, which it operates jointly with Tri-Arrows Aluminum. ""They certainly are in need of the ability to supply auto sheet. We've obviously built our capacity at other places in the U.S.,"" Fisher said.Novelis makes products for the North American auto industry at plants in Kingston, Ontario; Oswego, New York and Novi, Michigan.The company, owned by Indian conglomerate Aditya Birla Group, reported a net loss of $13 million in its second quarter as aluminum premiums continued to decline.

""As a segment gets that big, it's probably going to fragment into different requirements,"" Odell said in an interview ahead of the unveiling on Tuesday in Los Angeles of the 2017 Ford Escape, a re-styled version of the company's best-selling SUV model in the United States.Ford sells a smaller sport utility vehicle called the EcoSport in Europe and Latin America and has studied it for the U.S. market, Odell said. ""It could at some point become a substantial part of the industry,"" he said. Separately, United Auto Workers union officials and analysts have said they expect Ford to use a factory in Wayne, Michigan to build a new SUV and a new pickup truck after production of the Ford Focus compact car is moved to Mexico in 2018. Sales of the current Escape in the United States should beat last year’s record of 306,212 vehicles, Odell said. But Escape sales are rising at a slower pace than several competitors, up just 1 percent for the year to date compared with 15 percent for Toyota Motor Corp's (7203.T) RAV4 and 41 percent for Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) 's Rogue.The intense competition Ford faces is reflected in decisions the company made as it revised the 2017 Escape, which goes on sale next year.  Ford redesigned the exterior and interior of the 2017 Escape. But it won’t offer collision avoiding automatic emergency braking systems on the 2017 Escape, Odell said. Toyota said it will offer such collision avoiding systems as optional equipment for $300 to $500 on many 2017 models.""We think we’ve got more than enough safety technology on this product that’s relevant to the drivers that they would be prepared to pay for,"" Odell said. Vehicles in the Escape’s class have starting prices just under $24,000, and Japanese and European competitors currently have cheaper currencies to offset the cost of new features.  Ford and several other automakers agreed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in September to make automatic emergency braking standard on future new vehicles for the U.S. market.

811,"  (Adds details, background)LAGOS Nov 17 Ford Motor Co's new Nigerian assembly plant has built its first model and will produce an initial 10 vehicles a day for the domestic market, the U.S.-based carmaker said on Tuesday.The company said in August it would start the assembly of its best-selling Ford Ranger pickup trucks in Nigeria, as it expands in Africa and the Middle East.The auto market in Africa's biggest economy has huge potential but only a small number of new vehicles are sold annually. The sector is dominated by imported used vehicles and the absence of an industrial policy that would encourage suppliers to set up in Nigeria has stunted growth. ""Africa is one of the youngest markets in the world and presents a huge opportunity in terms of consumption,"" Jeff Nemeth, Ford's sub-Sahara chief executive, said in a statement. The Nigerian assembly plant, set up in partnership with Ford dealer Coscharis Motors Ltd, is the first in Africa outside South Africa, where Ford produces the Ranger for 148 markets.""The facility will accommodate one shift and will produce an initial 10 units per day for the Nigerian market, creating approximately 180 direct and indirect jobs,"" Nemeth said. The Ikeja plant near Lagos will assemble the Ford Ranger using parts and components imported from South Africa. It will have the capacity to assemble up to 5,000 vehicles annually, which will be sold in Nigeria.Ford produces 85,000 vehicles in South Africa each year, which are sold in 24 African countries.

813,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Leaders of the United Auto Workers union scrambled Wednesday to salvage a proposed labor agreement with Ford Motor Co (F.N), warning rank-and-file members that a rejection of the deal could jeopardize investments that would sustain U.S. factory jobs.With three-fourths of the national Ford union voted counted, 52 percent have rejected the proposed contract, Jimmy Settles, head of the UAW's Ford Department, said at UAW Local 600 in Dearborn, Michigan.He and other UAW officials appealed to Ford workers still to vote to support the deal or risk losing some of the $9 billion in investments in U.S. factories that Ford has promised in the agreement.""I seriously think that if we don’t ratify it, that (investment) would be in jeopardy,” Settles said. “And that’s job security. If they invest in plants, they don’t close plants.”Voting extends through Friday night, including at Local 600, which has 8,500 of Ford's nearly 53,000 UAW members.Final results will not be known until at least Friday night, with a UAW announcement due on Saturday, Settles said. The UAW needs a majority of votes for the contract to be ratified.UAW leaders have clashed with the rank and file at all of the Detroit Big Three automakers.A proposed four-year national contract for hourly workers at the U.S. operations of General Motors Co (GM.N) is in doubt because skilled trades workers have voted against it. UAW leaders are working with GM management to resolve the concerns of skilled trades workers, who repair factory equipment.  UAW President Dennis Williams needed two tries to win ratification of a four-year contract for hourly workers in the U.S. operations of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV  (FCHA.MI)(FCAU.N).After the first Fiat Chrysler contract was rejected, union leaders renegotiated a deal that put more money in members' paychecks, including a larger bonus for ratifying the agreement.""WE GAVE UP THE FARM""  UAW leaders say the proposed agreement with Ford is the richest in history. But that hasn't stopped the rank and file from using social media to challenge them, saying the deal does not do enough to make up for pay and benefits that were sacrificed when Ford struggled to restructure during the last recession.The automaker has enjoyed robust profits this year as sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles made in UAW factories have boomed.UAW leaders are concerned they no longer have the leverage to demand higher wages, now that vehicles made in UAW factories account for less than one-half of U.S. auto sales.“We were the reason that Ford stayed out of bankruptcy, and people did give up a lot,” said Bernie Ricke, president of Local 600. But Ricke said remaining competitive requires a ""delicate balance,"" especially with the threat that automakers could shift jobs to Mexico.

814,"  (Adds graphic links, stock action)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT Nov 18 Leaders of the United Auto Workers union scrambled Wednesday to salvage a proposed labor agreement with Ford Motor Co, warning rank-and-file members that a rejection of the deal could jeopardize investments that would sustain U.S. factory jobs.With three-fourths of the national Ford union voted counted, 52 percent have rejected the proposed contract, Jimmy Settles, head of the UAW's Ford Department, said at UAW Local 600 in Dearborn, Michigan.He and other UAW officials appealed to Ford workers still to vote to support the deal or risk losing some of the $9 billion in investments in U.S. factories that Ford has promised in the agreement.""I seriously think that if we don't ratify it, that (investment) would be in jeopardy,"" Settles said. ""And that's job security. If they invest in plants, they don't close plants.""Voting extends through Friday night, including at Local 600, which has 8,500 of Ford's nearly 53,000 UAW members.Final results will not be known until at least Friday night, with a UAW announcement due on Saturday, Settles said. The UAW needs a majority of votes for the contract to be ratified.UAW leaders have clashed with the rank and file at all of the Detroit Big Three automakers. A proposed four-year national contract for hourly workers at the U.S. operations of General Motors Co is in doubt because skilled trades workers have voted against it. UAW leaders are working with GM management to resolve the concerns of skilled trades workers, who repair factory equipment.UAW President Dennis Williams needed two tries to win ratification of a four-year contract for hourly workers in the U.S. operations of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV   .After the first Fiat Chrysler contract was rejected, union leaders renegotiated a deal that put more money in members' paychecks, including a larger bonus for ratifying the agreement. ""WE GAVE UP THE FARM"" UAW leaders say the proposed agreement with Ford is the richest in history. But that hasn't stopped the rank and file from using social media to challenge them, saying the deal does not do enough to make up for pay and benefits that were sacrificed when Ford struggled to restructure during the last recession.The automaker has enjoyed robust profits this year as sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles made in UAW factories have boomed.UAW leaders are concerned they no longer have the leverage to demand higher wages, now that vehicles made in UAW factories account for less than one-half of U.S. auto sales. ""We were the reason that Ford stayed out of bankruptcy, and people did give up a lot,"" said Bernie Ricke, president of Local 600. But Ricke said remaining competitive requires a ""delicate balance,"" especially with the threat that automakers could shift jobs to Mexico.""If you don't have the investment, it doesn't matter what you negotiate in wages,"" said Ricke.Scott Houldieson, vice president of Local 551 in Chicago, where workers voted Wednesday, said members who were rejecting the contract believed it did not make up for the sacrifices that helped save Ford.""We basically gave up the farm,"" said Houldieson, pointing to a pay hike they gave up in 2006 and a cost-of-living raise not taken in 2009.Kristin Dziczek, labor analyst at the Center for Automotive Research, said Ford is not likely to spend more money on a richer contract overall if the two sides return to the bargaining table.Ford shares rose 1.7 percent to $14.40.(Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)",2015-11-18,F,"Wed Nov 18, 2015 | 2:55pm EST",UPDATE 3-Ford-UAW contract passage in doubt as voting nears end,http://www.reuters.com//article/autos-uaw-idUSL1N13D0VB20151118?type=companyNews

826,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Foreign automakers with plants in the United States will be able to offer lower vehicle prices as Ford Motor Co faces continued higher labor costs under a new four-year contract with its U.S. union workers.Ford said on Monday a labor cost gap of $8 to $10 per hour will remain with nonunion automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp and Hyundai Motor Co under the new labor deal. This will allow the foreign companies to offer more attractive options while keeping vehicle prices competitive with the unionized Detroit Three automakers, or charge less for their vehicles.Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said the new agreement with 53,000 U.S. workers brings the company's labor costs on par with crosstown rival General Motors Co and closer to that of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles - the other unionized U.S. automakers.Labor costs will rise during the life of the agreement with the United Auto Workers by less than 1.5 percent annually, in line with expected inflation, Ford executives said on a conference call with analysts and reporters.Ford said it will incur $600 million in expenses this year from the new contract. Cost increases will be kept in check by ""significantly"" greater use of temporary workers who make less than full-time employees, said Bill Dirksen, Ford's labor chief. He would not  specify the rising number of temp workers.Under the new contract, the UAW must approve the use of temporary workers, which will keep their numbers from rising to the level used at non-union plants.Fields said Ford can leverage its global manufacturing footprint to boost its competitiveness in North America.  ""In this contract, we're not restricted from sourcing products anywhere in the Ford world for sale in the U.S. as long as we're meeting our U.S. sourcing commitment,"" said Fields.While Fields did not specific models, Ford, for instance, could import the EcoSport, a small SUV it makes in several places including Brazil. Ford's hourly labor costs will rise to $60 from $57, GM's to $60 from $55, and Fiat Chrysler's to $56 from $47 by 2019, when the agreements between the Detroit Three and the UAW run out, according to the Center for Automotive Research, an industry consultancy.Last year, Ford's U.S. labor costs were $9 higher than Toyota's and $16 higher than Hyundai's, the consultancy said.UAW Ford workers ratified the new pact on Nov. 20.

827,"  DETROIT Nov 30 Ford Motor Co said on Monday it will incur a $600 million expense this year tied to its new four-year contract with the United Auto Workers union in the United States.The expense is consistent with the company's previously stated expectations for 2015, according to a statement issued by Ford.Most of the $600 million expense are tied to a ratification bonus for the company's nearly 53,000 UAW members. That bonus works out to $10,000 per worker, including $1,500 in 2016 profit sharing. The UAW announced on Nov. 20 that its members at Ford had narrowly voted to ratify the new four-year contract.

A unanimous three-judge panel from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a ruling that granted Ford summary judgment, finding that the lower court erred by ignoring a state appellate court decision that boosted plaintiffs' claims and siding with Ford's interpretation of the Focus warranty.

832,"   By Gleb Stolyarov and Alexander Winning | MOSCOW  MOSCOW U.S. carmaker Ford's (F.N) Russian unit is considering expanding exports as weak sales in its home market look set to continue for another year at least, its chief executive told Reuters.Russia's auto industry is a major casualty of the economic crisis precipitated by the collapse in oil prices and Western sanctions over the Ukraine conflict.Car sales are down over 30 percent year on year in the first 10 months of 2015 as consumer purchasing power has been eroded and business activity contracted.That has prompted local carmakers to eye exports to minimize losses, while Ford's rival General Motors Co (GM.N) quit Russia.""Export is something we're looking at,"" said Mark Ovenden, president and CEO of Ford Sollers, Ford's joint venture with Russian partners. ""I'd like to look at it beyond a few thousand (vehicles) ... and see whether there is a more strategic export opportunity for us.""Ford Sollers already exports into former Soviet countries such as Kazakhstan in small volumes, but Ovenden said the company could also target markets in Eastern Europe and beyond.Ford has a presence in Eastern Europe with a factory in Romania but it does not produce all of the models there that it produces in Russia, where it makes the Fiesta, Focus, EcoSport and Transit, among others. It is considering all of its model types for exports as well as engines made at a $275 million powertrain plant it launched in the Russian republic of Tatarstan this year.Ford sold around 30,500 cars in Russia in the first 10 months of the year, roughly 40 percent less than in the same period a year earlier, according to data from the Association of European Businesses lobby group.It can produce as many as 350,000 cars a year in Russia and hence has considerable potential to ramp up exports. Ovenden said he expected total Russian car sales this year of around 1.5 to 1.6 million units and the same amount next year, well below the 2.5 million units sold in 2014 and the 3.5 million Russian carmakers are capable of producing per year.""The challenge everyone will face is that when domestic demand is volatile, how do you continue to fill the capacity?"" he said in an interview at Ford's offices on the outskirts of Moscow. ""That's where I think you need to develop the export capability.""Russia-based car manufacturers exported some 80,000 units in the first 10 months of the year, according to customs data, a comparatively small amount. Exports to traditional markets in the former Soviet Union are sharply lower as their economies are in the doldrums too.While several producers including Volkswagen VOWF_p.DE and Nissan (7201.T) have said they could ramp up exports from Russia, they are yet to announce final decisions. Ovenden said Russia-based carmakers would need continued government support for these plans to come to fruition, however. He said this could take the form of freight support or duty repayments for imported parts that have become more expensive due to the weaker rouble.Russia's government has said it could provide support measures worth around 50 billion roubles ($726.3 million) for auto producers in 2016, according to recent comments by Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich.That compares with 2015 measures worth 43 billion roubles.

Ford's first aluminum-body truck, the 2015 F-150, was launched in December 2014.The trucks will go on sale late next year, a Ford spokesman said, adding that Alcoa Inc, which supplies the F-150 along with Novelis, will also be a supplier for the Super Duty trucks.Automakers have been looking for lighter aluminum alloys to replace high-strength steel, which is far heavier. Lighter aluminum alloys would enable them to build vehicles that burn less fuel but meet safety standards. Growing aluminum demand from car manufacturers is one of the few bright spots in a severely oversupplied market. The Super Duty series is the first major vehicle to announce it is becoming aluminum-intensive since the F-150 announcement last year.The move may restore positive sentiment on automotive demand for aluminum after an absence of new plans for aluminum-intensive vehicles following the F-150's shift. Novelis plans to use ""what we learned from the massive success of the game-changing 2015 Ford F-150"" in working on the F-Series, Novelis North America President Marco Palmieri said in a statement.The move comes a month after Novelis raised concerns about U.S. automotive aluminum demand, with Chief Executive Steve Fisher saying the industry was going through a ""digestion period"" following Ford's F-150 announcement.He said plants were shifting capacity to automotive purposes, and away from other applications, at a slower rate than anticipated. Novelis, owned by Indian conglomerate Aditya Birla Group, is in the process of constructing its third automotive sheet finishing line at Oswego to supply the F-Series, which will be the second-highest volume aluminum automobile after the F-150.The use of aluminum in the F-Series will reduce the trucks' weight by 350 pounds (159 kg), compared with a 700 pound (318 kg)-reduction for the F-150.The news comes as exports from top-producer China have pressured London Metal Exchange (LME) prices to 6-1/2 year lows, prompting curtailments at U.S. primary aluminum smelters.The U.S. Midwest premium paid on top of LME prices for physical delivery AL-PREM has also tumbled by two-thirds this year, though it has increased slightly and stabilized around 8.75 cents a lb on news of the smelter closures.

849,"   By Jessica Dye  Dec 30 - This December, Ford recalled more than 300,000 older vehicles with faulty headlights that have been blamed for 11 accidents, and Sweet Leaf Tea Corp had to pull some of its 16-ounce bottled beverages from shelves after four customers complained about finding glass fragments. One recall that could be on the horizon in the new year involves hoverboards - a self-balancing scooter that was also a hot holiday gift item for 2015. Consumer Product Safety Commission chairman Elliot Kaye said in a Dec. 16 statement that the agency has launched an investigation into reports that the hoverboards, powered by lithium ion batteries, can catch fire, either while being charged or in use. Kaye said the CPSC is also monitoring whether the toys can lead to dangerous falls, landing users in emergency rooms with concussions or broken bones.

850,"   By Joseph White | LAS VEGAS  LAS VEGAS Toyota Motor Corp and Ford Motor Co said on Monday they will adopt the same software to link smartphone apps to vehicle dashboard screens and invited other automakers to join them to counter Apple Inc and Google's push to control cars of the future.Toyota, the world's largest automaker by vehicle sales, and Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, said they will adopt a Ford-developed software called SmartDeviceLink, or SDL, as the standard for connecting smartphone apps to vehicle dashboard screens.SDL technology integrates smartphones apps with vehicles through dashboard buttons, display screens and voice recognition technology. Using it as a standard for projecting navigation or music streaming apps from a driver’s smartphone could help Ford and Toyota reduce dependence on Apple or Alphabet Inc's Google, company officials said.It could also keep tighter control of customer data and the brand-defining look and feel of dashboard infotainment systems, they added.Adopting a connectivity standard not linked to Apple or Google may help automakers in China, the world’s largest auto market, where homegrown companies such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd are major players in mobile mapping and services. Google has a limited presence in China, although the company has signaled it could expand there. Ford said France’s Peugeot SA and Japanese automakers Honda Motor Co , Subaru and Mazda Motor Corp are also investigating adopting SDL as a standard. QNX Software Systems and UIEvolution, developers of automotive connectivity technology, are also adopting SDL, Ford said. QNX, a unit of Canada’s Blackberry Ltd, designs infotainment system software used by 40 automakers.  The Ford-Toyota tie-in follows the purchase late last year by a consortium of German automakers of HERE, a mobile mapping business formerly owned by Finland’s Nokia.

852,"   By Joseph White | LAS VEGAS  LAS VEGAS Ford Motor Co (F.N) said Tuesday it plans to triple to 30 the size of its fleet of self-driving test cars as part of an effort to accelerate autonomous vehicle development. In an announcement coinciding with the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Ford said it will begin using a new, lower cost LiDAR sensor made by California-based Velodyne. The high cost of such sensors, which act as the eyes of a self-driving car, is one of the main technical obstacles to widespread commercialization of self-driving vehicles, industry executives say. Ford said it will be the first automaker to use Velodyne’s new solid state ""hybrid Ultra PUCK Auto"" sensor. The compact device replaces the spinning scanners mounted on the rooftops of some autonomous test vehicles. Ford said two of these sensors could replace four current LiDAR sensors. The Ultra PUCKs are small enough to mount on a side-view mirror, Ford said.Ford said it will add 20 hybrid Ford Fusion sedans to its existing 10-vehicle self-driving car fleet, and test them on roads in California, Arizona and Michigan. Rival automakers are also testing fleets of self-driving cars on and off public roads. Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google has been testing self-driving cars of various kinds, including some of its own design, since 2009. Separately, Ford said it is exploring ways to link in-home automation devices such as Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) Echo to the Sync communications systems in its cars to allow consumers to control lights or thermostats inside the home from the car, or start up cars and check fuel levels from inside the house.In a third technology-related move, Ford said it will collaborate with drone maker DJI to sponsor a contest to develop drone-to-vehicle communications systems using the connectivity systems on a Ford F-150. Contestants would design a system that United Nations workers can use to survey disaster areas, Ford said. The winner would get $100,000. Ford also said Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) CarPlay and Google's Android Auto smartphone connectivity platforms would come preinstalled in all 2017 model year cars equipped with Sync 3, its latest infotainment system. Ford said 2016 model year car owners with Sync 3 will be able to upgrade to Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.

Shanks said the reporting change was in part a result of the de-risking strategy the company announced in 2012.Ford had been studying a move since 2010, when Verizon and AT&T switched their pension reporting to mark-to-market, said Stacey Steslicki, Ford's controller for global retirement benefits. About 50 companies that use U.S. accounting methods have made the switch, she said.Stuart Rowley, Ford's controller, said the move will make it easier for the company to compare its financial performance with  its U.S. and global competitors, and moves the company closer to accounting methods used by international companies. The move will have no effect on the company's cash, pension funding requirements, retiree pensions or the amount of underfunding for the pensions, said Steslicki.Operating profit margins will also rise because of the change, including an increase to 7.1 percent for the first nine months, from 5.9 percent. Profit margins in North America for the first nine months of 2015 will show a rise to 10.9 percent from 9.9 percent, and the company's full-year 2015 North American profit margins will be about 1 percent higher than they would have been if the reporting change had not been made, Rowley said.Ford's pensions were underfunded by slightly less than $10 billion at the end of 2014, a figure Ford will update when it issues full-year and fourth-quarter results on Jan. 28. Ford's pensions were underfunded by $19 billion at the end of 2012.Ford shares fell 1.5 percent at $12.91 as the broader S&P 500 index dropped 1.4 percent.

871,"  LAGOS Jan 12 Nigeria's state-backed AMCON ""bad bank"" said on Tuesday it plans to sell its majority stake in Peugeot Automobile Nigeria (PAN) Limited, a local joint venture with the major French automaker, and is seeking bids from investors.Peugeot Citroen is the technical partner to the Nigerian assembly plant, which has capacity to assemble 240 cars a day, PAN said on its website.In a statement, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) said it owned 79.3 percent of PAN Nigeria Limited, having acquired the stake four years ago after purchasing the company's debt and taking some as equity.PAN Nigeria Limited was set up in 1972 as a joint venture between the Nigerian government and France's Peugeot, with an annual production of 90,000 cars by the 1980s.But operations nosedived and the company accumulated bad loans shortly after the government sold its stake via a privatisation to local core investors in 2006. AMCON said PAN Nigeria had assets totalling 24.96 billion naira ($125.43 million) as of December 2014 and equity of 11.98 billion naira, and was seeking investors with experience in automobile manufacturing to buy the stake on offer.Bids will close on Jan. 26 at 1600 GMT, it said. President Muhammadu Buhari is keen to promote a ""Made in Nigeria"" industrial policy. In November, he met Peugeot's executive vice president for Africa and the Middle-East, Jean-Christophe Quemard, to discuss the revival of local production.The government under a National Automotive Industry Development Plan has ordered local car distributors to come up with plans for new assembly plants, along with threats of imposing prohibitive import duties. U.S. carmaker Ford Motor Co's partnership with a local car dealer has built its first model in Nigeria at a new assembly plant in November and said it will produce an initial 10 vehicles a day for the domestic market.The auto market in Africa's biggest economy has huge potential but only a small number of new vehicles are sold annually because the sector is dominated by imported used vehicles, and the absence of an industrial policy that would encourage suppliers to set up in Nigeria has stunted growth.AMCON was set up to absorb bad loans from banks after a $4 billion bailout in 2009 rescued nine lenders from collapse. AMCON then bought bad loans at a discount in exchange for government-backed bonds and has since been selling off collaterals against those loans to pay bondholders.

872,"   By David Shepardson | DETROIT  DETROIT The U.S. government and a group of global automakers are set to unveil a voluntary agreement at the Detroit auto show on Friday aimed at improving auto industry safety and spurring culture changes, according to company and government officials.The accord could set the framework for further discussions on safety reforms and mark a new era of cooperation between automakers and regulators after a record-setting year of safety fines, recalls and investigations into malfunctioning vehicles made by General Motors Co (GM.N), Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU.N), Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and others.But it stops short of what many safety advocates have urged Congress and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to adopt: new binding legal requirements to toughen safety rules. And automakers may be able to raise the voluntary agreement to argue against future proposed regulations, saying the accord makes legally binding rules unnecessary.The agreement, under discussion for several weeks, would also attempt to improve vehicle cyber security and the use of early warning data to detect potential defects that might lead to safety problems or large-scale recalls, sources said. It would also create new government-industry task forces to work to improve auto safety.Despite the voluntary agreement, NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind said the agency will not hesitate to fine automakers that fail to follow the rules and will not give up its aggressive enforcement of auto safety rules.    Automakers recalled a record-setting 63.95 million vehicles in the United States in 2014, incurring large fines from NHTSA.Companies in the talks leading up to the agreement include GM, Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), Ford Motor Co (F.N), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), Fiat Chrysler, BMW AG (BMWG.DE), Honda, Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) and Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS). The agreement is to be announced at the auto show in the U.S. auto capital of Detroit by U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx and top auto executives, sources told Reuters.In a letter last week to the NHTSA seen by Reuters, the group of 16 automakers said industry support of an agreement ""reaffirms our shared commitment to safety, and signals to the public the areas in which government and industry intend to collaborate to further improve automotive safety.""Automakers met with the NHTSA in Chicago on Dec. 16 and since then exchanged proposed ""Principles for Working Collaboratively to Enhance Motor Vehicle and Traffic Safety."" In recent days, NHTSA and automakers have continued to propose revisions, including discussions about government-industry working groups, according to auto industry officials who spoke to Reuters at the Detroit show. The talks come after NHTSA came under intense criticism in 2014 for failing to detect ignition switch defects in 2.6 million older GM cars linked to at least 124 deaths. Since then, NHTSA has been more aggressive in handing out fines and demanding outside monitors oversee automaker safety compliance.NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind said on Monday in an interview on the sidelines of the Detroit show that the agency cannot make vehicles safe simply by imposing new regulations and handing down fines. He said he hoped a deal would be announced Friday.""We're going to have to find new tools - that means new collaborations, new partnerships,"" Rosekind said.But the voluntary agreement will not be enforceable - and is not as tough as what some safety advocates have called for. With only a year remaining in the Obama administration, there is a shrinking window to complete new legally binding auto safety rules. Sean Kane, president of Massachusetts-based Safety Research & Strategies Inc and an auto safety advocate, praised NHTSA ""for having a dialogue"" with automakers and prodding them to do more on safety ""and be strong on enforcement.""Kane raised concerns about a voluntary agreement that is not legally enforceable. ""It also eliminates input from outside parties"" like safety advocates and consumers, Kane said, ""and that is a little troubling.""    Foxx met with top executives from major automakers on Dec. 1 in Washington. A spokeswoman for Foxx said there have since then been ""productive discussions with auto manufacturers toward agreement on steps to bolster safety.""Foxx ""is hopeful that they will soon result in concrete commitments that lead to significant safety improvements that will strengthen public confidence,"" said his spokeswoman.Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne said on Monday he agreed with the NHTSA that the auto industry needs more collaboration with regulators. He said he wanted the industry to ""get to a stage where safety is no longer a competitive edge used by one automaker against another.""

Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields, in a separate interview, also said the automaker is exploring various options to boost its move into car-sharing, self-driving technology and services built on staying connected with customers during the 900 or so hours a year they are behind the wheel. Neither Ford nor Fields would comment on speculation that Ford is pursuing some form of alliance with internet leader Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google to collaborate on development of self-driving cars, or what the industry calls autonomous vehicles.Ford is pursuing its own efforts to develop autonomous driving technology, and said last week it would triple the size of its self-driving car test fleet to 30 vehicles.“The technology may be ready before society is,” the chairman said, referring to autonomous cars.  As the U.S. No. 2 automaker builds its new mobility and connected vehicle businesses, Ford the chairman said his company may consider new management structures. The automaker’s capital-intensive core business of building cars and trucks operates with different rates of return on investment, and different levels of risk, from investing in rapidly changing technologies or service businesses.  Ford’s previous CEO, Alan Mulally, pushed the automaker to operate as “One Ford,” with executives from different operations meeting weekly to share information and resolve problems. ""We’ve managed ourselves well with One Ford,” said the chairman. ""We want make sure we do this thoughtfully and not create separate companies that aren’t aligned.” (Reporting By Joseph White; Editing by Bill Rigby)",2016-01-12,F,"Mon Jan 11, 2016 | 7:07pm EST",Ford Chairman: 'We are in an experimental stage',http://www.reuters.com//article/us-autoshow-detroit-billford-idUSKCN0UQ00P20160112?type=companyNews
874,"  (New throughout, adds background on competing GM and Ford investment plans)By Joseph White and Bernie WoodallDETROIT Jan 13 A looming slowdown in global auto demand will test U.S. automakers General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co as they try to funnel more cash to shareholders while still investing adequately in new vehicles and technology.At a conference on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show, the rivals outlined their strategies for an era of slower growth and rapid shifts in technology and consumer behavior.As of Wednesday, GM was winning the referendum among investors, with its shares up slightly, while Ford shares sank about 5 percent. Yet with investors concerned about the challenges facing the automakers, shares of both companies remained well below the highs they hit during the past 52 weeks.Some of these issues, such as the ups and downs of the sales cycle and pressure to make cars safer, are as old as the car industry itself. Others are still not clearly understood, for instance the transformation of cars into digital devices and selling to consumers who want to buy rides instead of cars.Automakers face a challenging future where 60 per cent of the value of a car is software and content, said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas, who has a sell rating on Ford and is restricted from covering GM. With China's market uncertain and U.S. vehicle sales at a peak, ""more investors will say it's a pretty good time to sell"" automaker shares, he said.GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra and two of her top executives outlined plans to return to shareholders a total of $16 billion for the period of 2015 through 2017. In March 2015, GM agreed to return a total of $10 billion in share repurchases and increased dividends through the end of 2016. If GM carries out the plan, the once-bankrupt automaker will have returned to shareholders about $23 billion between 2012 and the end of 2017, or about 90 percent of free cash flow, Chief Financial Officer Chuck Stevens said.Top Ford executives announced a special dividend of $1 billion, but cautioned that margins in its North American auto market could plateau at about 9.5 percent.Ford and GM executives faced questions from analysts about how they will juggle investments needed to keep global product lines competitive, while forging into new and riskier ventures involving ride sharing and autonomous vehicles.In addition to giving investors more cash, GM President Dan Ammann said the company plans by late this decade to reduce capital spending as a share of revenue below the current rate of 5 percent to 5.5 percent. In the past, such buybacks and capital spending cuts would have hurt GM's efforts to develop competitive new models. But Barra and Ammann said now the company can do more with less.For instance, Ammann cited GM's plan to invest $5 billion to work with its Chinese partner to engineer a low-cost vehicle architecture for developing markets. This will replace a hodge-podge of vehicles currently produced with different tools and dies and components.Once new vehicle architectures such as the emerging markets car are engineered, ""we will be able to run those assets for a long time,"" Ammann said, adding basic architectures could used for the ""next decade-plus."" In the short run, though, the strain will show as automakers work to keep vehicles fresh, comply with new regulatory demands for cleaner cars and fend off challenges from Silicon Valley disrupters such as the Uber ride sharing service.Ford executives cautioned Tuesday that margins in the company's core North American auto business could plateau at about 9.5 percent in part because of investments in new ""mobility"" ventures such as car sharing and development of self-driving cars.Ford is also spending this year on a push to enroll consumers in a program called ""FordPass"" that will stream consumer data to Ford in return for services such as quick access to parking. FordPass is a response to the threat that digital companies, such as Apple Inc or Alphabet Inc , will step between drivers and car makers.Fields said new, technology-enabled service businesses could provide Ford with ""sources of revenue that are less cyclical"" than auto sales.Investors, however, are watching a flattening sales cycle. Industry veterans say a slide in sales is inevitable.China and the United States, the world's No. 1 and 2 auto markets, have hit plateaus after six years of robust growth. Industry executives are forecasting slower expansion this year in both markets, albeit from record levels.""We still are very strong on China,"" said Barra. Long term, she said the Chinese auto market could grow to 35 million vehicles from about 25 million currently. For now, she said, ""It's going to be very volatile.""

875,"   By David Shepardson  Ford Motor Co (F.N) on Tuesday declared a $1 billion supplemental cash dividend, but its outlook for 2016 profit failed to exceed Wall Street's estimates, sending its stock down in after-hours trading.The No. 2 U.S. automaker said it expected record 2015 pre-tax profit, excluding special items, in the ""upper half"" of its outlook for $10 billion to $11 billion. That is above the average analyst forecast of $9.4 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Profit for 2016 will be at least as high, excluding special items, said Ford. Analysts were expecting pre-tax profit of $11 billion for 2016, on average.“Their guidance is in line or below what was expected,"" said Matthew Stover at Susquehanna Financial. Ford shares dipped about 1 percent from Tuesday's close, to $12.55, in after-market trading.Ford's chief financial officer, Bob Shanks, told investors at a conference in Detroit Tuesday evening the company expects higher costs this year as it invests in new model launches and technology-driven ventures to offer transportation as a service or develop autonomous vehicles. Shanks also cautioned that Ford's North American margins, forecast at 9.5 percent or better for 2016, may not have much room to improve in a competitive market.""At some point margins don’t grow any further,"" Shanks said. The forecast margins for North America ""are extremely strong margins for a volume manufacturer."" Healthier profits from Europe and Asia offer an opportunity for overall profit growth, he added. The $1 billion supplemental cash dividend, or 25 cents per share, is in addition to the first-quarter regular dividend of 15 cents per share, which is unchanged from the dividend paid in the fourth quarter of 2015. Ford paid $2.5 billion in dividends last year, up 20 percent from 2014. At an industry conference in Detroit on Tuesday, Mike Jackson, chief executive of AutoNation Inc (AN.N), the largest U.S. auto dealer group, said the peak of the industry’s cycle has been reached and a plateau began in the fourth quarter of 2015. Last year, U.S. auto sales hit a record 17.4 million vehicles, nearly breaking a record set in 2000.Last March, rival automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) said it would buy back $5 billion worth of shares and distribute another $5 billion in dividends to shareholders by the end of 2016.

Ford Motor Co's (F.N) fourth-quarter earnings beat Wall Street expectations and the company reiterated a forecast that 2016 pre-tax profit would be equal to or higher than last year.But the company cautioned again that profit margins in its North American business in 2016 may not equal the 10.2 percent level achieved in 2015 and the stock was down 1.2 percent around $11.70 late Thursday. Excluding one-time items, Ford earned 58 cents a share in the fourth quarter, versus Wall Street expectations of 51 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The automaker earned most of its money in the quarter and for the full year in North America, where falling gasoline prices have spurred demand for profitable large pickups, including the Ford F-150 and Super Duty models.     Ford improved profits in Asia and in Europe, where the automaker Ford turned a full-year profit for the first time since 2011. However, a $295 million quarterly loss in Latin America more than offset the $131 million fourth quarter profit from European operations. Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks said Thursday Brazil's economy will continue to contract.Despite record profits for 2015, Ford shares have slumped more than 15 percent since Jan. 1 through the close of trade on Wednesday as analysts and investors have begun factoring in fears that the U.S. and Chinese auto markets are headed for slower growth, or possibly contraction, over the next several years following a long boom.Ford disappointed investors earlier this month with a 2016 profit outlook that called for pre-tax profits excluding special items to be ""equal to or greater than"" the $10.8 billion reported for 2015. Analysts had expected pre-tax profit of $11 billion for 2016, on average. Ford said earlier this month it will pay a special dividend of $1 billion.     Ford said North American automotive profit margins for the fourth quarter were 10.2 percent, compared with 9 percent a year ago. For 2016, Ford has projected North American profit margins of 9.5 percent or better. ""We are at more of a plateau, but at very high absolute levels,"" Shanks told reporters Thursday morning. Rival General Motors Co (GM.N), which reports fourth quarter results Feb. 3, has forecast 10 percent margins for its North American operations in 2015.

888,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) Chief Executive Mark Fields said on Thursday he is ""always open to talking with others"" about partnerships on small cars.Fields was speaking generally about partnering on small cars without directly addressing whether he would consider a vehicle-making alliance with rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N). Fiat Chrysler Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on  Wednesday the company would stop making two sedans, the compact Dodge Dart and midsize Chrysler 200, and said he was looking for partners to share small car production.Cheap gasoline has undercut the already-narrow profit margins for smaller cars while stoking demand for trucks and sport utility vehicles. Asked during a conference call about the Fiat Chrysler move, Fields said Ford is ""always open to talking with others ... because we realize that we have to be very realistic around what is the type of revenue that these vehicles will be able to command and make sure we have an appropriate cost structure to earn a reasonable return.""Fields said Ford initially determines whether a ""need in the marketplace"" can be met fully within the company. ""In other cases we can say, listen, there are other great companies out there that we can approach and partner with,"" he said. Earlier on Thursday, Ford reported record pre-tax profit of nearly $11 billion for 2015 and said it expects to match or improve on that in 2016.Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks in a separate interview pointed to Ford's collaboration with General Motors Co (GM.N) on fuel-saving transmissions as an example of how the company will work with rivals to share costs. “I think there are all sorts of things that one can do in terms of partnerships and collaborations, at the vehicle level, and the component level, and elsewhere. I think everything’s on the table,"" Shanks said.

896,"   By Niklas Pollard | STOCKHOLM  STOCKHOLM Volvo Car Group trebled earnings in 2015 on strong demand in Europe and the United States, and forecast record sales in 2016, taking it a step closer to carving out a long-term niche in the premium auto market.After stagnating under the Ford Motor Co. (F.N) umbrella, Volvo won a new lease of life after it was bought by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group in 2010, unleashing a wave of investment in new models and factories.Last year Volvo's sales topped 500,000 cars for the first time, a step toward its medium-term goal for annual sales of 800,000, while operating earnings rose to 6.62 billion Swedish crowns ($776.6 million) from 2.13 billion.Volvo remains a minnow in an auto industry where volumes are measured in millions, but strong sales of the first in a string of new and increasingly up-market models, the XC90 SUV, have helped boost revenue and profit.""Volvo is a bit freer under the ownership of Geely compared to that of Ford,"" said Patrik Strom, associate professor at the University of Gothenburg, the town where Volvo is based.""The have entered a positive trend where you see that the investments and efforts they began a couple of years after they were bought by Geely are actually bearing fruit."" Volvo is banking on a 75 billion crown investment program in new, pricier models and plants to secure it a firm foothold in a premium market dominated by German heavyweights such as Daimler's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz and BMW (BMWG.DE).""We will continue to improve profitability, because we have to do that as we look three or four years ahead when we are to reach our target of 800,000 cars and profitability in line with other premium manufacturers,"" CEO Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters.  With lower volumes than rivals, Volvo is also seeking economies of scale by basing all its new models on only two platforms, while also giving it more flexibility to adjust production in a fast-moving auto market.    ""This is absolutely pivotal,"" said CEO Samuelsson, a former executive at truck makers MAN SE (MANG.DE) and Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) Scania, after unveiling the brand's new V90 estate, the third new model under Geely stewardship.""Everybody says, as a small manufacturer, how will you be able to keep up in terms of development? Our answer is this modular architecture that give us volume benefits internally, but above all lets us update all our cars at the same time.""The system will be key as Volvo seeks to boost profit margins that, while steadily improving over the past two years, still lag those of rivals such as Daimler.   Volvo said 2015 revenue rose to 164.0 billion crowns from 137.6 billion as a slowdown in China was more than offset by growth in other markets.The company, one of Sweden's biggest by sales and number of employees, said it saw growth in all its main markets - China, Europe and the United States - underpinning its forecast for what would be a third straight year of record sales in 2016.

898,"   By Paul Lienert | DETROIT  DETROIT The growth of car-sharing services will erode traditional manufacturers' vehicle sales and revenues through 2021, but will not be nearly as disruptive as the rise of self-driving cars later in the decade, a study forecasts.The evolution of car sharing services, such as those provided by Avis Budget Group's (CAR.O) Zipcar and Daimler AG's (DAIGn.DE) Car2Go, could trim global vehicle sales by 550,000 in 2021 and cost manufacturers more than $8 billion in lost revenue, according to a survey released on Tuesday by Boston Consulting Group.But car-sharing will have a far greater impact in Europe and the Asia-Pacific than in North America, the study predicts. Automakers in North America are expected to lose about 52,000 sales a year to car-sharing customers in 2021, but that will be offset by sales of 44,000 vehicles a year to car-sharing fleets, for a net loss of only 8,000 vehicles at a cost of just over $500 million, BCG researchers said.In addition, U.S. automakers such as Ford Motor Co (F.N) and General Motors Co (GM.N) are investing in car-sharing services in several markets to supplement individual vehicle ownership. In the longer run, according to the study, ""autonomous vehicles will have a much greater impact on new-car sales than car-sharing will,"" but not until 2027.The study did not account for the short-term impact of ride- hailing services such as Uber and Lyft. But it noted that the arrival of self-driving vehicles in the late 2020s will trigger the convergence of car-sharing and ride-hailing. Car-sharing will not be ""a true game changer,"" the study concluded, but self-driving cars ""will change the game, erasing the distinction"" between car-sharing and ride-hailing while providing users with ""a significant edge in the total cost of ownership.""

905,"   By Alexandria Sage and Paul Lienert | SAN FRANCISCO/DETROIT  SAN FRANCISCO/DETROITGoogle's self-driving car team is expanding and hiring more people with automotive industry expertise, underscoring the company's determination to move the division past the experimental stage.The operation now employs at least 170 workers, according to a Reuters review of their profiles on LinkedIn, the business-oriented social network. Many are software and systems engineers, and some come from other departments at Google.More than 40 of the employees listed on LinkedIn have previous automotive industry experience, with skills ranging from exterior design to manufacturing. They hail from a wide range of companies, including Tesla Motors Inc, Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co.For a look at the composition of Google's self-driving car team, see tmsnrt.rs/1oxX4LgGoogle has not disclosed details about the size or composition of its self-driving car team, and Johnny Luu, spokesman for Google's car team, declined to comment. The team could have additional members who do not publish profiles on LinkedIn.Google has said previously that it intends to ready the technology for a marketable self-driving car by 2020, but it may never manufacture vehicles itself. The tech giant is more likely to contract out manufacturing - much like Apple does with iPhone - or to license technology to existing car manufacturers, automotive industry experts said. Licensing would follow the model Google has used with its Android operating system for mobile devices. In the past four weeks, Google has advertised nearly 40 new positions on the team, and many are related to manufacturing. The team currently has six people with such experience, including purchasing, supplier development and supply chain management. Hires with manufacturing skills could help Google find and coordinate with a partner to build a vehicle, said Paul Mascarenas, a former Ford executive who is president of FISITA, the International Federation of Engineering Societies.Google is also engaged in discussions with federal and state regulators about how to revise motor vehicle safety standards to accommodate autonomous cars.The competition for technical talent is intensifying as tech and automotive companies race to build driverless vehicles. Beyond Google, the players include Tesla, established car makers such as Daimler AG and GM and, and technology companies such as Apple Inc and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL].Google's team is being assembled by John Krafcik, an industry veteran who previously headed Hyundai Motor Co's U.S. operations and is an expert in product development and manufacturing. Krafcik joined Google in September 2015. Another senior executive with previous automotive experience, Paul Luskin, was hired last month as operations manager, according to his Linkedin profile. An engineer with stints at Jaguar Cars, Ford and Japanese supplier Denso Corp, Luskin most recently was president of Ricardo Defense Systems, a unit of Britain's Ricardo PLC, according to the Linkedin profile.Google hired industry veteran Andy Warburton in July to head the vehicle engineering team, according to his Linkedin profile. Warburton spent two years as a senior engineering manager at Tesla and 16 years as an engineering manager at Jaguar.A third auto veteran, Sameer Kshisagar, joined Google in November as head of global supply management on the self-driving car team. Kshisagar is a manufacturing expert who previously worked for GM, according to his Linkedin profile.Luskin, Warburton and Kshisagar did not respond to requests for comment.Google's self-driving car group also has tapped people with experience beyond the auto industry, including aerospace (Boeing, SpaceX, Jet Propulsion Lab) and electronics (Intel, Samsung, Motorola), according to LinkedIn profiles.   Krafcik and Chris Urmson, director of the car team, have said they want to forge partnerships with established automakers and others to build vehicles. Krafcik made a public pitch for alliances at an auto industry conference in Detroit in January.However, Google may have to look farther than the auto industry to find a manufacturing partner, said Raj Rajkumar, a Carnegie-Mellon University professor who advises companies on self-driving car development.The tug-of-war over who controls - and profits from - the stream of user data in self-driving cars is ""an inherent and fundamental conflict"" between Google and traditional automakers, Rajkumar said.Instead, Google may choose to build its own engineering and design prototypes, then partner with a Chinese automaker or an Asian contractor such as Hon Hai Precision Industry's Foxconn Technology Co that wants to enter the automotive field, several experts said.Michael Tracy, a Michigan-based auto manufacturing consultant, said Google sees the potential of several different revenue streams from its self-driving technology, including licensing its mapping database and vehicle control software, as well as an integrated package of software, sensors and actuators that would form the backbone of a self-driving vehicle.The least likely prospect is that Google will manufacture its own vehicles, Tracy said, due to the massive expenditures required and the stiff competition from established automakers.

906,"   By Dan Freed   (This version of the March 3 story corrects paragraph 33 to indicate that Patrick Kaser is a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, not Brandywine Asset Management)By Dan FreedBank of America (BAC.N) is making a big push into auto lending just as regulators are sending warning signals, losses from auto loans are rising, and rivals are growing more cautious after years of strong returns.The bank tapped mortgage executives Matt Vernon and John Schleck to lead the auto lending business last May, saying they would be able to sell auto loans alongside other products such as checking accounts and home equity loans.In interviews, the executives and their boss, D. Steve Boland, who oversees a broad swath of consumer lending, said they still see room for growth from borrowers who have good credit. They have hired extensively in recent months, adding dozens of loan officers and salespeople.But some competitors and bank analysts said hiring doesn't make sense at this stage, because auto sales may be close to peaking, and consumer credit is showing signs of weakness.Industry-wide, banks classified $1.1 billion worth of auto loans as uncollectible in the fourth quarter, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. That is up 15 percent from the year-ago period, and up 39 percent since the fourth quarter of 2011. Ultimately, much of that bad debt turns into losses for the banks.For a graphic showing auto loans that are 30-89 days past due and an auto sales projection, see tmsnrt.rs/24xv9vV ""I'm not actively hiring or growing our operations across the platform. That's for sure,"" said Andrew Stuart, head of TD Auto Finance, which is slightly smaller than Bank of America's auto business.At a Feb. 10 conference, Capital One Financial Corp (COF.N) CEO Richard Fairbank said that while auto loans provided ""once in a lifetime type returns"" after the financial crisis, the business has begun to lose strength. In a January interview on CNBC, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called the market ""stretched.""Portales Partners analyst Charles Peabody said Bank of America is late to the auto loans party. But in its defense, he noted that the bank's Chief Executive Brian Moynihan and his management team were too busy trying to resolve mortgage-related issues when the auto lending business seemed like a smarter bet.""They should have been beefing this thing up two years ago, but two years ago Moynihan was still trying to stabilize the ship,"" Peabody said.SLOWING MOMENTUM  All banks are struggling to boost revenue during a period of stubbornly low interest rates and tough post-crisis regulation, but Bank of America has felt the pain more acutely than most of its peers.The second-largest U.S. bank by assets, Bank of America trades at just 50 percent of book value, compared to 90 percent for JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and 130 percent for Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N). Bank of America took bigger losses than those rivals during the crisis, and still lags them by other key metrics, including return on equity and costs in relation to revenue.While Bank of America showed some progress in 2015, it still has to prove it can generate consistent performance under Moynihan, who took the helm in 2010. During his tenure, the bank has paid tens of billions of dollars in fines and settlements related to mortgages that were issued before he became CEO.Bank of America ranks 10th among U.S. auto lenders, with just 1.84 percent of the market in the fourth quarter of last year, according to data released Thursday by Experian Automotive. Ally Financial Inc (ALLY.N), the largest U.S. auto lender, accounts for 5.75 percent, followed by Wells Fargo, which ranked second with 5.66 percent. JPMorgan was third with 4.97 percent.Auto sales remain very robust. Figures carmakers released on Tuesday showed that sales climbed to a 15-year high for the month of February, driven by low gasoline prices, wage growth, and because loans are both available and cheap. But most forecasters expect sales to peak in 2016 and trend down over the next few years.""We remain in the 'plateau' camp,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak wrote on Tuesday, sticking to his flat sales forecast.Stocks have broadly declined in recent months over concerns about the global economy, and some companies that make money selling or financing vehicles have gotten hit even harder. They recovered some of those losses after the latest sales figures. Ford Motor Co (F.N) and General Motors Co (GM.N) are down roughly 6 and 11 percent, respectively, since the beginning of the year, while publicly-traded auto lenders Santander Consumer (SC.N) and Ally are down 35.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. The S&P 500 Index .SPX has dropped 2.8 percent so far this year.Delinquencies on bonds comprised of subprime auto loans hit their highest level in six years, Fitch Ratings said last week. According to the FDIC, 1.82 percent of all auto loans were 30 to 89 days past due during the fourth quarter – the highest rate on record since the FDIC began keeping track in 2011.As weakness in the auto sector has become evident, regulators have begun to sound alarm bells.In a speech in October, U.S. Comptroller of the Currency Thomas Curry warned of risks from subprime auto loans, as well as loans that mature in six years or more, which tend to be issued to customers who can't afford monthly payments on loans with shorter durations. In November, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued a report on auto lending that showed a growing portion of loans being issued to consumers with poor credit.FOCUSED ON PRIME  Bank of America says it is focused strictly on prime and ""superprime"" customers. The ""majority by far"" of its auto borrowers have credit scores higher than 700, Vernon said. Borrowers with credit scores above 660 are generally considered to have good credit.Still, a decline in used car values would lower recoveries on loans that go bad, and the longer the life of the loan the greater the exposure to such a risk. Bank of America will lend up to 75 months — slightly longer than the six years Comptroller Curry cited as a concern — though Vernon said the average maturity is far lower.The bank does not release granular data on its auto loan book, so it is hard to know how its borrowers' credit quality has held up over time. In data provided to Reuters, Bank of America said it made $23.7 billion in auto and recreational vehicle loans in 2015, up 41 percent from 2014.Most of that growth came through auto dealers, the area Vernon oversees, and much of it happened in the fourth quarter after he hired seven ""relationship managers"" whose job is to drum up business with dealerships around the country. Vernon is targeting 5-10 percent growth for his operation in 2016.Schleck, who oversees the business that works directly with retail customers, has also been staffing up — nearly doubling the number of loan officers to 110 from 60 since last May. Although Schleck said he is unlikely to continue growing staff at that pace, he may hire more this year if demand warrants. Likewise, if demand cools, Schleck said he is prepared to reduce staff.""I needed to get to a certain level to be able to provide a certain level of service and I needed to get there very quickly—and did,"" he said. ""Prior to May there was probably a lot of lost opportunity, whereas after May, I'm capturing what maybe we could have captured earlier.""Boland, their boss, said it's true that Bank of America was ""in a different place in 2012,"" but disputed the idea that the bank is too late to build up its  auto loans business.""I don't feel like I'm late at all,"" he said. ""There's not a timing issue to it. I'm going to continue to focus on growing across our consumer lending.""As long as the bank is cautious about borrowers and keeps staffing in line with demand, it can grow just by selling to more of its existing customers, Boland added.Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management, which owns about 26 million Bank of America shares, said the bank's strategy is sensible even if it comes at a less-than-optimal time. The bank pulled back ""far too much"" from certain businesses after the shock of its mortgage losses and fines, and re-entering the market with a focus on healthy consumers makes sense, he said.""Only time will tell if they're entering at the peak and whether or not they'll be too aggressive,"" said Kaser, ""but the banks have a lot of incentive to show discipline.""

910,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK, March 14  NEW YORK, March 14 Auto stocks have come roaring out of the gate in the last month, but the gains may be short-lived as analysts and investors show signs of souring on the sector.The sector has handily outperformed the 10 percent returns posted by the S&P 500 since the benchmark index hit a two-year closing low on Feb 11. Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co are both up more than 15 percent since then, and Tesla Motors Inc has surged more than 40 percent.The gains have been supported by a 7 percent year-over-year increase in auto sales in February, with sales reaching a 15-year high, helped by low gas prices.But in a pessimistic sign, investors have been shorting the group - which also includes motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson  and recreational vehicle manufacturer Thor Industries  - at the fastest pace of any sector in the Russell 1000, according to Fundstrat Global Advisors data. Investors sell short on expectations that a stock will fall. In a short sale, shares are borrowed in the hope that they can be bought back at a cheaper price to pay off the loan, allowing the investor to pocket the difference.""People are getting kind of jittery and thinking, How much more does this really have to run? How much more credit can people float? And when does the cycle start to turn?"" said Nicholas Ghattas, research analyst at Fundstrat in New York. Autos have been among the most downgraded industries by analysts in recent weeks, according to Fundstrat. The average recommendation for Ford, General Motors and Tesla has been trending toward a ""hold"" rating over the last 30 days, according to Thomson Reuters data.Predictive analytics company Prevedere also suggests shares could be headed for a slowdown. Its leading indicator for the industry, which measures momentum, is currently hovering near its lowest level since 2012. Andrew Duguay, senior economist at Prevedere, said with oil prices already so low, it is unlikely that future cuts in gasoline prices would continue to boost auto sales.While the sector appears poised for a downturn, the traditional automakers may be the least susceptible. GM and Ford still are sensibly priced at roughly six times their estimated per-share earnings for the next 12 months, well below their own long-term average and the S&P's 15.7 percent price/earnings multiple.On the other hand, tech darling Tesla, at $116 a share, is priced at a whopping 98.5 times forward 12-month earnings. While the company has said it expects to report its first net profit by this year's fourth quarter, analysts are more optimistic, with current forecasts calling for an adjusted profit of 10 cents a share in the second quarter and $1.32 for the full year.

921,"   By Naomi Tajitsu | TOKYO  TOKYO Five years after a huge earthquake temporarily crippled parts of Japan's auto supply chain, some companies have adjusted the industry's famed ""Just in Time"" production philosophy in a bid to limit any repeat of the costly global disruption.The quake exposed the vulnerability of a system pioneered after World War Two by Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), under which companies aim to boost efficiency by receiving small quantities of parts from suppliers only when needed. But even with the risk of new disasters in one of the world's most seismically active countries businesses have had to balance efforts to disaster proof the supply chain due to concerns of the cost of, say, storing more inventory in case of an emergency which may or may not strike.""Holding more inventory, or adding another production line as a business contingency measure may improve a company's robustness in the face of disaster, but it won't necessarily improve its global competitiveness,"" said supply chain expert Takahiro Fujimoto.""Companies which take such steps at the cost of competitiveness would probably go bust even before the next disaster occurs,"" said Fujimoto, a professor and executive director at Tokyo University's Manufacturing Management Research Center.Since the 2011 disaster, global auto suppliers have changed the way they produce and source the 30,000 parts required to assemble a single car, including raising stocks, diversifying production and creating alternative manufacturing capabilities.German drugs and chemicals maker Merck KGaA (MRCG.DE) said it has ""significantly"" increased its supplies of Xirallic, a pigment which creates the shimmery effect in vehicle paint, since the quake. Merck's plant in Fukushima Prefecture, which at the time produced the firm's global Xirallic supply, escaped major damage, but its warehouse was inaccessible immediately after the quake, prompting automakers including Ford and Chrysler to suspend sales of vehicles in certain colors. Nils Oldenburg, head of Merck's global pigments production, who was in charge of operations in Japan at the time of the quake, said Merck now keeps ""multi-month"" stocks of Xirallic at warehouses in Japan and other regions around the world.Merck in 2012 also began a second Xirallic production line in Germany. DUAL SOURCING, DUAL CAPACITY Other auto parts companies are also giving themselves more leeway on inventories. German-U.S. supplier ZF-TRW said it had increased stocks of some parts procured from single sources to last six days, double the three days it held before the quake.   But industry experts say that many Japanese firms are sticking to ""Just in time"", opting not to increase inventories.""The costs of maintaining extra inventory, or the view that extra inventory may be wasteful are considered to be reasons not to hold more stock,"" said Hiroaki Mochida, an analyst at Marusan Securities. A spokesman at Japan's Renesas Electronics Corp (6723.T), whose plant in Ibaraki Prefecture that produces microcontrollers used in automobiles was devastated in 2011, said it had not increased its inventories as a risk management strategy. However, he said it had begun to standardize more parts across vehicle models to improve efficiency and enable alternative production during emergencies. Tokyo University's Fujimoto said having capacity to transfer production to other lines was key to a quick recovery from disasters. TRW, which specializes in vehicle safety systems and was acquired by ZF Automotive last year, now stores back-up production equipment at more of its suppliers' plants.""In the past we believed that having moulds for some plastic parts at only one of our suppliers' plants, say either in the U.S. or China, would suffice, but now we have backups at other locations,"" said Yoshihiro Nakane, president of TRW Automotive Japan.The quake was also a wake-up call for automakers to keep better track of procurement.Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T), which spent weeks identifying how its suppliers had been affected by the quake, and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) have both developed supply chain databases.Nissan now also requires prospective suppliers to include alternative sourcing plans for parts for new models.

924,"  DETROIT/WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY Ford Motor Co (F.N) on Tuesday announced it would invest $1.6 billion to build more small cars in Mexico, starting in 2018, triggering a fresh blast of criticism from Republican front-runner Donald Trump.Following the announcement, Trump labeled the move ""an absolute disgrace.""""These ridiculous, job crushing transactions will not happen when I am president,"" the real estate billionaire said in a statement released by his headquarters.Ford stood by comments on the issue made two weeks ago by its chief executive, Mark Fields, who said the company would not back down on its production strategy.""We are a global, multinational company and we will invest to keep us competitive and we will do what makes sense for the business,"" Fields said.The automaker announced the investment in Mexico as Trump, U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich competed in a primary in Wisconsin seen as crucial in the race to become the Republican presidential candidate in the November election.Trump, who has criticized U.S. companies for ""sending jobs to Mexico,"" has singled out Ford for some of his harshest remarks. But data indicates that Ford builds fewer vehicles and employs fewer workers in Mexico than do its Detroit-based rivals, General Motors Co (GM.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N) Chrysler unit.In the United States, Ford has 55,300 hourly paid plant workers, GM has 54,000 and FCA has 36,600, the companies said. GM has about 12,000 hourly paid workers in Mexico, while FCA has 9,547 and Ford has 6,191, the companies said on Tuesday.In 2015, 80 percent of Ford's North American production came from its U.S. plants while 63 percent of GM's North American production came from its U.S. plants and 64 percent of FCA's North American production came from its U.S. plants, according to IHS Automotive.A senior Mexican official said Mexico had stepped back from a high-profile announcement on the Ford plant to avoid stoking tensions in the U.S. election debate stemming from Trump's comments. ""Due to the (election) debate, they (Ford) don't want to be in the spotlight,"" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Hinrichs declined to say which products Ford plans to build at the San Luis Potosi plant, which is slated to open in 2018 and will employ 2,800 by 2020.U.S. supplier sources have said the plant is expected to build the next-generation Ford Focus compact, as well as a Focus-based hybrid gasoline-electric model aimed at rival Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and described as a ""Prius fighter.""Ford joins a growing list of automakers investing billions in new production capacity in Mexico, where lower labor costs and favorable currency exchange mean companies have a better chance of turning a profit on low-margin small cars. And Mexico's numerous international free trade agreements allow for more profitable exports from Mexico to many countries, said Sean McAlinden, chief economist with the Center for Automotive Research.McAlinden said that Ford's Mexico workers make about $8.25 per hour in wages and benefits, compared with Ford's U.S. workers, who get $60 per hour in wages and benefits.During contract talks last summer, Ford confirmed that it would move Focus production out of its Wayne, Michigan plant in 2018.

935,"   By Joseph White | DETROIT, April 12  DETROIT, April 12 Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it will modernize and  consolidate its sprawling Dearborn, Michigan, engineering and headquarters facilities over the next decade into two Silicon Valley-style locations.The auto company plans to move about 30,000 employees now housed in 70 buildings, some of which were built in the 1950s. The company will rebuild or upgrade 7.5 million square feet of office space in the transition. One location will be focused on engineering, research, technology and vehicle development and the other centered around its headquarters building in Dearborn.The company declined to say how much it plans to invest in the makeover. Ford released artists' renderings of proposed workspaces with plants, contemporary furniture, open office designs and bright lighting. New buildings will have broad expanses of glass and be surrounded by grass and trees. The new campuses will be ""a walkable community with paths, trails and covered walkways,"" Ford said, and include autonomous vehicles, on-demand shuttles, ebikes, new onsite services for workers and faster wireless internet.Such amenities are already found at the offices of big technology companies with which Ford competes for talent.

937,"   By Agnieszka Flak | AMSTERDAM  AMSTERDAM Toyota (7203.T), Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Ford (F.N) are the only remaining potential merger candidates for Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI), since its attempt to join up with GM (GM.N) was  rebuffed, Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said on Friday.Marchionne has long called for mergers of big players in the industry to help spread the costs of developing more technologically advanced cars that pollute less, but his preferred target GM has repeatedly refused to engage in talks.""The door (on M&A) has never closed, the need to consolidate does not go away,"" he said on the sidelines of a shareholder meeting in Amsterdam.However, Ford promptly said it also has no interest in a tie-up with FCA.""As we consistently have said, Ford has no plan or interest other than to continue to accelerate our One Ford plan, deliver product excellence and drive innovation in every part of our business,"" the company said in an emailed statement.  Marchionne, whose term as chief executive at FCA is due to run out in 2018, said Korean carmakers were also among the big players in the industry and there would be sufficient synergies to justify a merger, but ""the Koreans don't get married"".The major South Korean carmaker is Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS), which also owns nearly 34 percent of Kia Motors Corporation (000270.KS).In the absence of a merger partner, Marchionne has been focusing his efforts on executing an ambitious investment plan centered on revamping its Jeep, Alfa Romeo and Maserati brands and eliminating FCA's debt.  The CEO said he was open to the possibility of the company starting to pay dividends again before 2018 if the carmaker is first free of debt. FCA had net industrial debt of 5 billion euros at the end of 2015 and expects to be cash positive to the tune of 4-5 bln euros at the end of 2018. Marchionne's comments about industry consolidation follow a renewed pitch made for an alliance by FCA Chairman John Elkann a day earlier, who said a combination of FCA with one of the ""big guys"" could yield annual savings close to $10 billion. ""But you need two to tango and most of our competitors are busy with the great opportunities that technological disruption has to offer,"" Elkann said in a letter to shareholders of Exor (EXOR.MI), referring to a focus on new developments such as car sharing and self-driving vehicles. Exor is the investment vehicle through which Italy's Agnelli family controls FCA.Elkann said selling cars would still be a ""massive industry"" in 2030, by when new sales are expected to be worth $4 trillion, up from $2.75 trillion in last year.""Boring old car makers need to figure out how to make this profitable,"" he said.

938,"  NEW YORK, April 17 Shares of General Motors Co  and Ford Motor Co could rise at least 25 percent in the next year, with U.S. auto sales likely to come in stronger than many investors fear, according to a report on Sunday in Barron's financial newspaper.Both companies' stocks look cheap, Barron's said. Ford and General Motors trade at 6.6 times and 5.6 times expected 2016 earnings, respectively. The broader S&P 500 has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 17.Shares of both companies have been under pressure as a result of investor fear of a downturn in the U.S. auto market as well as economic weakness in China. But investors are forgetting several positives, Barron's said. For one thing, the automakers are much leaner than in previous years, which could help profitability. Also, while U.S sales could slip from the first quarter's pace of 17 million-plus units a year, they are likely to plateau at 16.5 million to 17 million vehicles annually, the publication said. Both GM and Ford have said they would still break even if annual sales fell to about 11 million. Healthcare costs for retired unionized workers are no longer an obligation, Barron's added. The costs have been shifted to a trust fund run by the United Auto Workers that the automakers paid billions to create.

943,"   By Norihiko Shirouzu | BEIJING April 22  BEIJING April 22 Ford Motor Co said on Friday it will next year start selling a big American pickup truck in China where the vehicles are mostly used by construction and other such workers and a culture of recreational and personal use is only just emerging.The Dearborn, Michigan automaker said it aimed to bring ""a new level of capability to China's off-road enthusiasts"" with the F-150 Raptor.Ford said in a release it planned to display the Raptor truck at the Beijing auto show which opens on Monday.According to the company, the truck is equipped with a 3.5-liter turbo-charged V6 engine that produces the power of a V8 engine with the fuel economy of a V6. A Ford spokesman said fuel economy numbers for the China-bound truck were not available, nor was the truck's price tag.The F-150 Raptor, unlike the standard F-150 truck, is a ""purpose-built"" vehicle and is more for personal use. The truck is 15 cm wider than the standard F-150, which Ford said creates ""a more purposeful stance."" Ford said the truck's exterior design was ""about projecting an image,"" while ""the interior design is about creating a comfortable place for driver and passengers to enjoy their time, both on- and off-road.""Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consulting firm Automotive Foresight, said the timing of Ford's decision to launch the Raptor was ""not bad at all"". The launch was probably timed in anticipation of the day China significantly loosens traffic control restrictions that ban pickup trucks from densely populated urban areas.Zhang said China's pickup market, which generated sales of about 200,000 vehicles last year, could start growing rapidly if those truck traffic controls are relaxed.""It took more than 10 years for pickup truck sales to hit the 200,000 vehicle mark from levels around 120,000,"" Zhang said.""If those traffic rules are relaxed significantly, the market could quickly grow to a million vehicles a year or significantly more.""

946,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Alphabet Inc's Google unit (GOOGL.O), Ford Motor Co (F.N), the ride-sharing service Uber [UBER.UL] and two other companies said on Tuesday they are forming a coalition to push for federal action to help speed self-driving cars to market.Sweden-based Volvo Cars, which is owned by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co GEELY.UL, and Uber rival Lyft also are part of the Self-Driving Coalition for Safer Streets. The group said in a statement it will ""work with lawmakers, regulators and the public to realize the safety and societal benefits of self-driving vehicles.""The coalition said David Strickland, the former top official of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the top U.S. auto safety agency that is writing new guidance on self-driving cars, will be the coalition’s counsel and spokesman.""What people are looking for is clear rules of the road of what needs to be done for (fully autonomous) vehicles to be on the road,"" Strickland said in an interview Tuesday, emphasizing the companies want to deploy them safely. ""Nobody wants to take a shortcut on this.""Strickland, who has advised Google on self-driving car issues, said the group is ""a full policy and messaging campaign and movement"" and not just about lobbying lawmakers or regulators. In 2014 there were 32,675 fatalities and 2.3 million injured in 6.1 million crashes on U.S. roads. NHTSA says about 94 percent of all traffic crashes are caused by human error.On Wednesday, NHTSA is holding the second of two public forums on its self-driving car guidelines that will feature comments from tech companies and automakers at Stanford University.NHTSA did not immediately return a message seeking comment on the coalition. Ford said in a statement the group will ""work together to advocate for policy solutions that will support the deployment of fully autonomous vehicles.""NHTSA hopes to release its guidance to states, policymakers and companies on self-driving vehicles in July.California has proposed barring self-driving cars that do not have steering wheels, pedals and a licensed driver ready to take over in an emergency, which Google has opposed. Under current regulations, fully autonomous vehicles without human controls are not legal. NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind has said policymakers should avoid a ""patchwork"" of state regulations on self-driving cars but has not taken a position on California's proposal.In February, NHTSA said the artificial intelligence system piloting a self-driving Google car could be considered the driver under federal law, a major step toward winning approval for autonomous vehicles.The five companies, which all are working on self-driving cars, say one of the group's first tasks is to ""work with civic organizations, municipalities and businesses to bring the vision of self-driving vehicles to America’s roads and highways.""

Ford has countered that it intends to invest $9 billion in U.S. factories, as outlined in the company's 2015 contract with the United Auto Workers union.The larger of Ford's latest U.S. investments will be $1.4 billion for a production line at a Livonia, Michigan, factory to produce a new 10-speed automatic transmission for the company's rear-wheel-drive vehicles.  The Livonia plant currently employs about 1,550 hourly and salaried workers in total. The new 10-speed transmission line will employ about 500 union workers, Ford said. “Most of the people will move from building one transmission to another,” Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford’s Americas operations, said in an interview. The United Auto Workers said last fall that Ford planned to spend as much as $1.8 billion overhauling that factory to produce three new transmissions. Separately, Ford said it would spend $200 million at an assembly plant in Avon Lake, Ohio, near Cleveland to add production of Super Duty chassis cab trucks, which typically are commercial vehicles such as ambulances or tow trucks. Ford has outlined just $1.7 billion of the $9 billion in manufacturing investments promised to the UAW last year. The Dearborn, Michigan, company has 55,300 hourly workers at its U.S. factories, more than any other automaker in the United States, including larger Detroit rival General Motors Co.  The future of auto manufacturing jobs has become a politically charged issue because of the federal bailouts of GM and the former Chrysler Group, and because UAW positions are under pressure from the growing number of car plants in Mexico.The Mexican factories pay workers hourly wages of roughly $8.25, compared with about $60, including benefits, for Ford UAW members, according to the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

950,"   By Paul Lienert and Alexandria Sage | DETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO  DETROIT/SAN FRANCISCO Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk has told investors his electric car company will stop burning cash and turn a profit this year, and corralling costs associated with quality problems will be critical to making good on that pledge.While Tesla has trimmed its average warranty repair cost per premium electric vehicle since 2014, it still spends more than twice as much as General Motors Co (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co (F.N), according to a Reuters analysis of company data. Tesla's warranty costs are also higher than those of Germany's Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars.Tesla and other auto makers don't reveal specific figures for warranty costs per vehicle, but they do disclose vehicle deliveries, and total spending for warranty repairs and accruals, representing money set aside for future warranty repair work. Last year, according to a Reuters analysis of data provided in the company's annual report, Tesla spent $1,043 per vehicle on actual repairs and set aside $2,036 in warranty accruals to cover future repairs on the vehicles it sold in 2015. It trimmed warranty expenses by 17 percent from 2014 and cut warranty accruals by 34 percent. Meanwhile, GM spent just $400 last year for every vehicle it sold on warranty repairs and set aside $332 for future work. Ford spent $429 per vehicle and set aside $308. Daimler spent $970 per vehicle and set aside $1,294.While Tesla builds only two models and last year sold just 50,000 vehicles, GM, Ford and Daimler all have widely disparate product lines and sell millions of vehicles a year. And where Tesla's 2015 revenue was just over $4 billion, the three larger automakers reported revenues of $150 billion and more. RESULTS DUE When Tesla reports first-quarter results on May 4, analysts will be watching to see whether it is on track to deliver positive cash flow for the year, as Musk forecast in February. Quality control and warranty costs are among the challenges as Musk prepares to ramp up production next year for the Model 3 sedan. Tesla plans to boost annual vehicle production over the next several years to roughly ten times the 2015 level. In 2015, Tesla lost a net $888.7 million, and lost $716 million from operations. It ended the year with $1.2 billion in cash, $708 million less than a year earlier. Tesla bolstered its cash balance with $730 million from the sale of new common stock. Total warranty costs were $52.8 million, and it set aside $103 million for future warranty repairs. Chief Financial Officer Jason Wheeler told analysts in February that as Tesla cars become more reliable, ""that reduces our warranty. That actually has a cash impact when the cars show up less at the service centers."" In a statement to Reuters, Tesla said it has reduced the cost of first-year repair claims as well as the amount of money it reserves for future warranty repairs. Among other steps, Tesla said it ""aggressively"" issues bulletins to its service centers to ""correct identified issues prior to a failure"" and to ""offer ways to enhance the vehicle after delivery, even (on) non-warranty related items.""  COMPLAINTS Tesla has been contending with complaints from owners about problems with Model S sedans and the recently launched Model X sport utility vehicle. Some customers have complained on internet forums that doors on their Model X SUVs wouldn't latch properly. Complaints about the Model X were amplified in April when Consumer Reports highlighted problems with the SUV. Fort Lauderdale Model X owner Colin Campbell told Reuters he loved his car, although he had to drive 30 miles home one day with one hand on the door, trying to keep it shut.""If you want to be one of the first to use the most advanced cars you have to expect you'll have some issues at the beginning,"" he said. Campbell added he ""recognized I'm a beta tester,"" a technology industry term for someone who gets to try a new product in its last stages of development.Tesla, in a statement to Reuters, said the number of issues the company has dealt with on the Model X has fallen by 400 percent over the past six months. The company has responded to customer complaints by offering to replace faulty sensors that sometimes saw obstacles that weren't there. The company said it issued a bulletin to service technicians to replace components in the mechanism that opened the falcon wing doors to remedy a creaking or groaning sound, and recently changed the design of the door latches. Tesla also fixes issues using over-the-air software upgrades.

951,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) reported first-quarter net income that more than doubled thanks to robust deliveries of pickup trucks in North America and a profit rebound in Europe, but cautioned that results in the second half of the year would likely not be as strong.The automaker's net income of $2.45 billion, or 61 cents per diluted share, in the first quarter through March 31, was up 113 percent from $1.3 billion, or 29 cents per diluted share, a year earlier.It reported record operating margins globally and in North America, and enjoyed its most profitable quarter in Europe since 2008.During a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Mark Fields said the automaker would be competitive with longer-range electric vehicles, and said Ford was developing such a vehicle, but he did not say when it would be introduced.In December, Fields said Ford would spend $4.5 billion to expand its plug-in and hybrid electric vehicles by 2020. Developing a longer-range vehicle is part of that effort, said Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks.Excluding one-time items, Ford's earnings per share of 68 cents easily beat Wall Street expectations of 48 cents a share. Shanks said on Thursday the second half of the year is not expected to generate as much profit as the first half. This was largely due to downtime for production plants in Europe and North America for normal summer and end-of-year shutdowns. Shanks said the company maintained its forecast for a North American profit margin for 2016 of 9.5 percent or better, after reporting a 10.2 percent margin last year.Ford also kept its full-year forecast for pretax profit that is expected to meet or exceed last year's record $10.8 billion.The company's shares were up 3.9 percent at $14.20 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, against a wider market that was little changed. GM shares were up nearly 1 percent.Fields said the company ""could"" curtail production of sedans as those traditional car models were not selling as well as SUVs and trucks. But he said he wanted Ford to have a ""full family"" of vehicles in case of changes in consumer demand and if fuel prices rise from their current low levels. RECORDS In North America, Ford had a record operating margin of 12.9 percent. This compares with rival General Motors Co (GM.N)'s first-quarter operating profit margin of 8.7 percent, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI) (FCAU.N)'s 7.2 percent in North America.However, GM included in its calculations for operating margin an expense for attribution of union workers in the United States, which Ford did not. The exclusion of that cost would raise GM's North American margin to 9.5 percent. Ford beat GM in both revenue and profit in the quarter, mainly because of stronger results in North America and Europe. Ford's quarterly revenue of $37.7 billion edged past GM’s $37.3 billion. GM last week reported a first-quarter net income of $2 billion, while Ford's net income was $2.5 billion.Ford reported $3.08 billion in pretax profit for North America, outpacing GM’s $2.3 billion for the quarter. In Europe, Ford earned a pretax quarterly profit of $434 million, while GM broke even.The company's global operating margin was 9.8 percent, while global pretax profit was a record $3.8 billion in the quarter.  Ford more than doubled profit in the Asia-Pacific region to $220 million, from $105 million a year ago. But it lost money outside of its China joint ventures.The company's equity income from its joint ventures in China was $443 million, up from $360 million, for a quarterly operating profit margin of 16.4 percent.

958,"   By Jake Spring | BEIJING  BEIJING Ford Motor Co's (F.N) monthly vehicle sales in China recorded the largest decline in a year while General Motors' (GM.N) sales growth returned to positive territory, clouding the outlook for the world's biggest auto market amid an economic slowdown. Ford's 11 percent year-on-year sales decline in April, disclosed in a statement on Thursday, was the biggest since the automaker began reporting monthly retail rather than wholesale data in May last year.China's auto sales growth ground to a near-standstill last year before rebounding thanks to a tax cut on small engine vehicles that began in October and extends to the end of this year. It remains uncertain whether that momentum will continue as economic growth declines.""China continues to be a dynamic marketplace as it transitions from an industrial economy to a consumer-led economy,"" Ford said in an emailed response to Reuters, without elaborating on why its sales declined in April.The sales drop extended the U.S. automaker's uneven start in 2016 after a 5 percent year-on-year rise in March and 9 percent fall in February from a year earlier. Meanwhile, GM said its China sales grew 7.5 percent in April compared to the same month in 2015, bouncing back amid a bevy of new model launches after a 0.6 percent sales decline in March.GM's Cadillac launched the XT5 crossover sport-utility vehicle in April, while Buick debuted an all-new LaCrosse midsize sedan in March.GM's joint venture partner, SAIC Motor (600104.SS), said in an exchange filing Thursday that its sales increased 6.9 percent year-on-year in April. SAIC also has a joint venture with Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), in addition to making cars under its own brand names. Ford will idle a plant in Chongqing that produces Ecosport sport-utility vehicles, and Focus and Mondeo sedans for maintenance for the remainder of the second quarter, according to its statement. It didn't make any link between the closure and the April sales fall.The downtime will not affect Ford's previously announced plan to produce 345,000 vehicles for the period in the Asia-Pacific, it said. The U.S. firm makes autos in China through ventures with Chongqing Changan Automobile (000625.SZ) and Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) (000550.SZ).For January to April, Ford China sold 391,294 vehicles, up 7 percent from the same period a year earlier. GM China sales increased 1.7 percent year-on-year for the same period.China's national automakers association said last month that the country's auto market grew 6 percent in the first quarter, the same growth rate predicted for full-year 2016.

962,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON General Motors Co said on Friday it was temporarily halting sales of about 60,000 new 2016 U.S. SUVs because the vehicles' window labels overstated their fuel efficiency.A spokesman for the largest U.S. automaker said GM discovered an ""inadvertent error"" on U.S. 2016 GMC Acadia, Buick Enclave and Chevrolet Traverse SUVs that caused the estimated fuel economy to be listed on the window label as 1-2 miles per gallon higher than it should have been. GM is stopping sales of the SUVs in dealer showrooms until a corrected label is placed on the vehicles.Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Laura Allen said Friday the agency has been notified by GM that it is correcting fuel economy labels on the three 2016 SUVs. ""We have asked the company to provide all relevant information to the agency,"" Allen said.GM said Friday the rating for the vehicles on the EPA's fueleconomy.gov website was incorrect but has since been corrected. New labels are expected to begin showing up at dealerships soon.The incident is the latest in a multitude of issues in recent years involving the auto industry overstating vehicle fuel efficiency.  Some automakers have previously compensated vehicle owners for overblown fuel economy ratings. Asked if GM will follow suit, GM spokesman Tom Wilkinson said the automaker ""will contact owners of the affected models to address this situation.""Automotive News reported GM engineers discovered the error as they worked on the 2017 model label. In April, Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T) admitted to overstating the fuel economy of four small car models sold in Japan, including two under Nissan Motor Co's (7201.T) nameplate.This week, Nissan agreed to buy a 34 percent controlling stake in Mitsubishi. Mitsubishi has said the overstatement didn't impact U.S. vehicles.In 2014, Korean carmakers Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) and affiliate Kia Motors Corp (000270.KS) agreed to pay $350 million in penalties to the U.S. government for overstating fuel economy ratings in about 1.2 million vehicles. That was on top of $395 million they agreed to pay to resolve claims from vehicle owners. In June 2014, Ford Motor Co (F.N) lowered the fuel economy ratings on six models and agreed to reimburse owners for the difference.Ford cut ratings on its 2013 and 2014 model year hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles as well as most 2014 Fiesta cars. It was the second time Ford cut fuel ratings for the C-Max hybrid in under a year.

964,"   By Helena Soderpalm and Mia Shanley | GOTHENBURG, Sweden  GOTHENBURG, Sweden The Briton who smoothed out Volvo's boxy lines and put signature radiator grilles on Lincolns for Ford is aiming to give China's Geely range global appeal by ditching its utilitarian image.Peter Horbury is central to efforts by Geely - long seen as a cheap, no-frills brand in China and unknown in the western world - to push upmarket and go international by tapping European design and technology.Zhejiang Geely Holding Group (0175.HK)'s purchase of struggling Swedish carmaker Volvo from Ford (F.N) in 2010 has helped it leapfrog a decade of research and development.The tie-up has enabled Volvo to sell more vehicles in China than anywhere else and produced a common platform for Geely to widen its range. But at seventh place in China's light vehicle brands, it has a long way to go in a sector suffering from overcapacity and stiff competition.Horbury, who headed up design at Volvo in the 1990s and oversaw it for Volvo, Jaguar, Aston Martin and Ford's other brands from 2002, says carmakers should play up their roots, citing what he called the ""Hi, I'm Dave"" all-American appeal of his Lincoln grille.""I'm not suggesting we'll do cars with pagoda roofs, but all new cars have a little signature somewhere that's Chinese,"" Horbury, Geely's chief designer since 2011, told Reuters at the Swedish design studio where he spends three weeks a month.That means dashboard curves which he compares to a famous Chinese bridge in Hangzhou where Geely has its headquarters.""Here at a Chinese company, I think there is something special to sell, and if you just become anonymous, that's what you remain,"" said Horbury, 66, who spends a week each month in Shanghai. Geely cars range from 38,900 Chinese yuan ($6,000) to 249,800 for an electric vehicle. Its new flagship GC9 sedan, which Horbury worked on, starts at around 120,000 yuan.""The product seems pretty good, styling wise, and they have got to get the core sedan product right which it appears that they have (with the GC9),"" said James Chao, Asia-Pacific chief of IHS Automotive. ""But that's just the start of the brand building exercise. It will take years for them to build this brand, whether it's this brand or another brand, to upgrade to the Volkswagen level,"" he said. ""In the meantime, they’ll have to price a bit more aggressively.""Volvo and Geely each sold about half a million cars last year while world leaders Toyota, Volkswagen and General Motors (GM) sold around 10 million each. In China, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) tops sales charts for all vehicles compiled by LMC Automotive, with the biggest homegrown manufacturer Changang in fifth place and Geely in 14th.COMPETITIVE NEIGHBORS Unlike neighbors Japan and South Korea, which are among the five top car exporting countries in the world, China is not even in the top 20, the World's Top Exports website shows. It exported fewer than half a million passenger vehicles in 2015, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.At the heart of Geely's ambition to break into European and U.S. markets is the China Euro Vehicle Technology (CEVT) development hub, created by Geely in 2013 in Sweden to build the platform which will be used in new Volvo and Geely small car models.On Wednesday, Volvo is set to unveil two new concept cars - the first to use the common platform. Sources have told Reuters Geely will launch a new brand next year, codenamed ""L"", with cars based on the platform. ""Not even during my time at GM did I experience a more aggressive growth plan,"" said auto industry veteran Mats Fagerhag, who heads CEVT, a tech center in Gothenburg with a staff of 1,700 in which Geely is investing several hundred million dollars a year.Fagerhag said local production in Europe could be a future step, to enable Geely, which also owns the company that makes London's trademark black cabs, to get a complete range of brands the same way Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has. Horbury declined to comment on brands.NUMBERS After initial scepticism over whether Geely could make the most of European technology, it has proven to be a keen investor and collaborator. The joint development between the Swedes and Chinese appears to be paying off when looking at the numbers.Volvo, whose ads play up its Swedish heritage, featuring football player Zlatan and musicians Swedish House Mafia, saw earnings triple last year thanks in large part to demand in China, now its largest market. ""We went from zero to three factories, to 5,000 people, 200 dealers,"" Volvo CEO Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters. Record sales are predicted this year as Volvo pushes into a premium sector dominated by German heavyweights such as Daimler (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz and BMW (BMWG.DE).Geely, which means auspicious in Mandarin, came through China's auto market slowdown with sales up 22 percent last year compared to 4.7 percent for the market overall.""Both can learn from each other - the knowledge that we have that is in the bricks here of how to engineer a car the way Volvo has ... the way we approach design from a more human point of view perhaps, and the fact that the Chinese come with a spirit of 'Let's get it done,'"" Horbury said.The designer, who started with a staff of six in a ""borrowed room"" at Geely, now leads 350 designers in Gothenburg, Shanghai, Barcelona and California.Geely Chairman Li Shifu, who founded the group in 1986 as a refrigerator parts-maker with a loan from his father, sometimes visits the Swedish studio - an old shipbuilding warehouse.Horbury said Li's approach was very different from that of his American or European bosses, combining entrepreneurship with art and poetry. One time, Li brought a stack of books to the studio littered with post-it notes.""One was on geology - rock formations - one was on Chinese landscape, one was on Chinese architecture, and fashion,"" Horbury said. ""Just examples that he felt would inspire the designers for the next Geely.""(This story corrects paragraph 15 to make clear new platform not for all car models) (Additional reporting by Edward Taylor in Frankfurt and Jake Spring in Shanghai; editing by Alistair Scrutton and Philippa Fletcher)",2016-05-17,F,"Tue May 17, 2016 | 8:55am EDT",China's Geely cars think big with Volvo makeover,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-autos-geely-design-idUSKCN0Y81C3?type=companyNews
965,"   By Joseph White | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) Chairman Bill Ford said on Monday the automaker would look for more partnerships with other companies as it moves to expand beyond manufacturing and selling cars and trucks.""You’ll see a lot of partnerships, a lot more than you used to see in the auto industry,"" Ford told reporters after addressing a conference on entrepreneurship in Detroit. Ford did not disclose any new deals and said Ford's management is still working to define its strategy for self-driving cars, connecting vehicles to the internet and developing new transportation services such as ride sharing. ""You'll hear more from us as this year goes on,"" the chairman said, adding the company would consider acquisitions ""if we thought that was the right way to go.""      Some of Ford's rivals, notably General Motors Co (GM.N), are taking a more aggressive approach. GM earlier this year invested $500 million in ride-hailing service Lyft, and this month closed the acquisition of self-driving vehicle technology startup Cruise Automation. GM has outlined a plan to develop autonomous electric vehicles for use by Lyft.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV this month said it would work with internet search leader Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google self-driving cars unit to integrate Google's autopilot technology into 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans.Asked about Google, Ford said, ""Anything’s possible with anybody. We have a good relationship with Google"" but no alliance to disclose. The company is investing heavily in self-driving vehicle technology, electric cars and other initiatives, he said. ""We’re fully competitive,"" he said. ""We’re not out talking about it all the time.""

966,"   By Joseph White | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) Chairman Bill Ford said on Monday the automaker would look for more partnerships with other companies as it moves to expand beyond manufacturing and selling cars and trucks.""You’ll see a lot of partnerships, a lot more than you used to see in the auto industry,"" Ford told reporters after addressing a conference on entrepreneurship in Detroit. Ford did not disclose any new deals and said Ford's management is still working to define its strategy for self-driving cars, connecting vehicles to the internet and developing new transportation services such as ride sharing. ""You'll hear more from us as this year goes on,"" the chairman said, adding the company would consider acquisitions ""if we thought that was the right way to go.""      Some of Ford's rivals, notably General Motors Co (GM.N), are taking a more aggressive approach. GM earlier this year invested $500 million in ride-hailing service Lyft, and this month closed the acquisition of self-driving vehicle technology startup Cruise Automation. GM has outlined a plan to develop autonomous electric vehicles for use by Lyft.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV this month said it would work with internet search leader Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google self-driving cars unit to integrate Google's autopilot technology into 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans.Asked about Google, Ford said, ""Anything’s possible with anybody. We have a good relationship with Google"" but no alliance to disclose. The company is investing heavily in self-driving vehicle technology, electric cars and other initiatives, he said. ""We’re fully competitive,"" he said. ""We’re not out talking about it all the time.""

975,"   By Joseph White | DETROIT  DETROIT Automakers investing billions in plug-in cars and self-driving vehicle systems are getting caution signals from new research that suggests many mainstream consumers don’t know what benefits they would get.A Harris Poll of 1,052 U.S. residents found that 67 percent didn’t know anyone who owned an electric car, a plug-in hybrid or a hybrid. The research by Harris, which has conducted surveys in the United States since 1963, was released Thursday and commissioned by Ford Motor Co. The Dearborn, Mich. automaker is investing $4.5 billion by 2020 to expand its lineup of plug-in hybrid, all-electric and hybrid models. About 76 percent of those surveyed said they were “not at all sure” how far a plug-in hybrid car could drive on a single refueling and recharging. Plug-in hybrids run on electric power stored in batteries, and switch to a gasoline engine when the batteries run out of charge. The average of the respondents’ guesses as to a plug-in hybrid’s driving range was 260.8 miles, less than half the actual range of most plug-in hybrids on the market. The poll found more affluent consumers and city dwellers were more familiar with electric and hybrid vehicles.  Separately, a survey released Thursday in Britain found that 55 percent of 2,002 respondents said they were unlikely to want to be a passenger in a driverless car. The poll was conducted by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers/ICM Unlimited. A separate study by University of Michigan researcher Michael Sivak earlier this week found similar wariness of driverless vehicle technology among U.S. residents.Tesla Motors Inc, the Silicon Valley vehicle maker, said it received 373,000 net orders for its Model 3 sedan based on showing a prototype vehicle that won’t be available until late 2017. Still, sales of plug-in, hybrid and electric vehicles in the U.S. are less than 3 percent of the total market, according to industry sales figures.  Mainstream automakers are under pressure to sell more plug-in vehicles to comply with greenhouse gas emission limits and state electric car sales mandates.Ford plans to step up efforts to sell plug-in hybrids such as the 2017 Ford Fusion Energi, which the company says has a 610 mile range, by staging events to allow customers to drive them, and creating new digital marketing to explain what the technology does.  ""The EV space is very fragmented,"" Ford Fusion marketing manager Wade Jackson told Reuters, referring to confusion over the different attributes of hybrids, plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles. ""Not a lot of manufacturers have come up with a clear understanding of what each means.""Among other efforts, Ford is also promoting road trips that plug-in hybrid owners could do on a single tank of gas, plus a battery charge. ""You can drive from San Diego to San Francisco,"" Jackson said.

977,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the Issuer Default Ratings  (IDRs) for Ford Motor Company (Ford) and its Ford Motor Credit Company LLC (Ford  Credit) finance subsidiary to 'BBB' from 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook for both is  Stable. A full list of the rating actions taken on Ford and each of its  subsidiaries follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS: FORD The upgrade of Ford's ratings is driven by the automaker's declining financial  leverage, its improving global product portfolio and its commitment to  maintaining strong liquidity. In addition, the upgrade reflects Fitch's  expectations for further profitability improvement, particularly outside North  America, as a result of the company's product initiatives and operational  restructuring. Fitch expects leverage to decline over the intermediate term as  the company repays maturing debt obligations with cash and as earnings and free  cash flow rise.  Ford's pension plans are well funded, and de-risking actions over the past  several years have largely insulated them from future changes in interest rates.  In addition, the company has grown its share in key emerging markets, most  notably China, which has reduced its reliance on the mature NA and Western  European markets. Overall, Fitch believes Ford's increasingly competitive  product portfolio and its lower and more flexible cost structure have  strengthened its ability to withstand the inherent cyclical and secular  pressures faced by all global auto manufacturers, while maintaining a solid  investment-grade credit profile. In a moderate to severe downturn, Fitch expects that Ford would likely  experience a significant cash outflow due to its inherent operating leverage,  working capital profile, and capital expenditure needs. However, Fitch expects  that the company's automotive net cash position of about $11 billion as of Mar.  31, 2016, along with about $10 billion of automotive revolver availability,  would provide it with sufficient financial flexibility to withstand a severe  decline in demand. Ford also has discretion over a portion its planned capital  deployment which could further relieve liquidity pressures in a downturn. This  could include delaying certain capital expenditures, limiting pension  contributions to only those that are mandatory, forgoing supplemental dividends  and holding regular dividends flat. In addition, various post-recession changes  in Ford's business profile have also positioned it to better withstand a  downturn. The company's break-even sales level is much lower as a result of  restructuring actions and an increased use of global platforms, its lower-priced  passenger cars are more competitive, and its sales are more globally  diversified. MOBILITY INITIATIVES Ford was one of the first mass-market auto manufacturers to strategically  position itself to take advantage of potential changes in future personal  transportation with its Smart Mobility initiatives. The initiatives cover a wide  range of mobility issues, from automated driving to car sharing, and the company  recently set up a separate subsidiary, Ford Smart Mobility LLC, to manage these  disparate projects. Although a number of the initiatives are unlikely to have a  material impact on the company's financial performance for at least several  years, Fitch views Ford's investments in these areas positively. Thus far, Ford  has largely drawn upon its in-house engineering resources to develop a number of  these initiatives, but has also invested in some relatively small acquisitions  and partnerships to move these initiatives forward. Although Fitch believes Ford will be relatively well positioned to compete as  new technologies alter personal transportation over the next decade, uncertainty  over the future competitive and technological landscape introduces significant  risks as well. In particular, a number of potential competitors, including  startups and technology companies from outside the traditional auto sector, are  actively working to disrupt the existing automotive business model, and Ford,  along with other mass-market auto manufacturers, could face significant  challenges in the face of a rapidly changing business environment. CREDIT METRICS STRENGTHENING Fitch expects Ford's profitability to remain relatively solid for a global  mass-market auto manufacturer over the intermediate term, with automotive EBIT  margins in the 4% to 5% range. Margins are likely to be weighed upon by  continued weakness in the South American market and challenging conditions in  Europe, where industry overcapacity will continue to depress profitability.  However, Fitch expects NA margins to remain relatively strong, in the  high-single-digit range, as the company benefits from consumers' increasing  preference for SUVs over sedans and as the company continues to lower its cost  structure in the region. Fitch notes, however, that slowing demand growth in the  NA market increases the risk of intermediate-term margin pressure. Ford's automotive credit profile has strengthened over the past two years, and  Fitch expects the improvement to be sustainable over the intermediate term.  Fitch expects EBITDA leverage (debt/Fitch-calculated EBITDA) to remain in the  low-1x range over the next couple of years and potentially decline below 1x even  in a moderating demand environment as the company continues to use FCF to pay  down maturing debt obligations. Actual EBITDA leverage was 1.1x at March 31,  2016. FFO adjusted leverage, which was 1.3x at March 31, 2016, is likely to  remain low as well, although variability in FFO could cause more volatility in  this leverage metric. Fitch expects Ford's automotive liquidity, both cash and revolver capacity, to  remain strong over the long term, which will provide the company with a  substantial cushion in the event of an unexpected downturn. The company  continues to target a cash balance of about $20 billion, which Fitch believes  would be sufficient to help the company weather a moderate to severe downturn  without the need for significant additional borrowing. As of March 31, 2016,  Ford had over $24 billion in automotive cash, cash equivalents and marketable  securities, augmented by over $10 billion in available revolver capacity  (excluding $3 billion revolver capacity that was allocated to Ford Credit). In  April 2016, Ford amended and extended the revolver, maintaining its overall  capacity, but shifting its maturities out by one year. FCF INCREASING Fitch expects Ford's FCF in 2016 to be substantially lower than the $2.8 billion  recorded in 2015, due largely to a combination of higher capital spending to  support future product and growth initiatives, as well as higher discretionary  pension contributions as the company continues to de-risk its funded plans. As a  result, Fitch expects Ford to produce FCF below $500 million in 2016, excluding  the impact of the $1 billion supplemental dividend paid in the first quarter of  2016 (1Q16). Beyond 2016, Fitch expects FCF to grow substantially, despite  capital spending that will likely remain elevated by historical standards,  driven largely by increased profitability and lower pension contributions. Fitch  expects FCF margins to run in the low-single-digit range over the intermediate  term, excluding any supplemental dividends. In January 2016, Ford announced that going forward, it would return excess cash  to shareholders via supplemental dividends and subsequently paid a $1 billion  supplemental dividend later in the quarter. The company noted at the time of the  announcement that the supplemental dividend would be paid in lieu of a broader  share repurchase program, due to the particular nature of Ford's shareholder  base. Fitch has excluded supplemental dividends from its FCF calculation, as it  views the dividends as discretionary in nature, and the company has communicated  to its shareholders that the amount of any supplemental dividends could vary  over time, depending on the company's capital deployment needs. In addition to its FCF, Ford at times also receives cash from Ford Credit in the  form of distributions. In 2015, Ford received $293 million in distributions from  Ford Credit. Going forward, Fitch expects distributions from Ford Credit will  vary from year-to-year depending on Ford Credit's capital requirements. In some  years, Ford Credit may not make any distributions to Ford. STRONG AUTOMOTIVE LIQUIDITY Fitch expects Ford to maintain a strong liquidity position going forward, as the  company targets an automotive cash balance of about $20 billion, augmented by  substantial revolver capacity. At March 31, 2016, the company's automotive cash  balance exceeded its target level, with over $24 billion in automotive cash,  cash equivalents and marketable securities. As such, Ford's automotive cash  exceeded its automotive debt by about $11 billion. Ford amended and extended its revolver in April 2016, maintaining a total  commitment of $13.4 billion, of which $3 billion is exclusively available to  Ford Credit. With the amendment and extension, 25% of the revolver commitment  matures in 2019 and 75% matures in 2021. At March 31, 2016, of the $10.4 billion  in commitments allocated to Ford's automotive operations, nearly the full amount  was available, as there were no borrowings outstanding, and only $45 million was  utilized to back letters of credit. Including available revolver capacity,  Ford's total liquidity position was about $35 billion or roughly $21 billion net  of automotive debt. WELL-FUNDED PENSIONS PLANS Ford's pension plans are generally well funded, and Fitch does not view them as  posing a significant risk to the company's credit profile. At year-end 2015, the  company's global pension plans were underfunded by $8.2 billion on a GAAP  projected benefit obligation (PBO) basis, leading to a funded status of 89%. The  company's U.S. plans were 92% funded, with an underfunded position of $3.7  billion. Ford contributed $1.1 billion to its global funded pension plans in  2015 and made $400 million in payments to its unfunded plans. In 2016, the  company plans to increase its contributions to its funded plans to $1.5 billion,  while contributing another $300 million to its unfunded plans. About $400  million of the contributions to the funded plans will be discretionary as part  of Ford's pension de-risking strategy, with the rest of the contributions  required to legal funding requirements. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --U.S. industry light vehicle sales total about 17.5 million units in 2016 and  global sales rise in the low-single-digit range. --Beyond 2016, U.S. industry sales growth plateaus around 17 million per year,  the Chinese market grows at a low- to mid-single-digit rate, Western Europe  continues to improve and South America slowly improves, but other developing  markets are uneven. --Over the intermediate term, Ford's revenue growth is tied primarily to global  volume growth and modest price increases, while global market share is held  about constant. --Automotive EBITDA margins rise over the next several years as global  production volumes grow, the company makes continued progress on cost  efficiencies, and profitability rises on new model introductions, while spending  on mobility initiatives, as well as increased vehicle technology investments put  some downward pressure on margins.  --Capital spending runs at about 5% to 6% of automotive revenue over the  intermediate term. --The company uses supplemental dividends to return excess cash to shareholders. --The company maintains a target automotive cash balance of about $20 billion,  augmented by about $10 billion of automotive revolver capacity. KEY RATING DRIVERS: FORD CREDIT The IDRs and senior unsecured debt ratings of Ford Credit have been upgraded as  a result of the direct linkage to Ford's ratings. Fitch considers Ford Credit to  be a 'core' subsidiary of Ford due to its importance to Ford, as demonstrated by  the high percentage of Ford vehicles sales financed by Ford Credit, and the  strong operational and financial linkages between the two companies. Ford Credit  further has a support agreement with Ford, which requires Ford to make capital  contributions to Ford Credit, if Ford Credit's leverage ratio (defined as net  debt-to-equity) were to be higher than 11.5x. The ratings also reflect Ford  Credit's strong credit profile, consistent operating performance, peer superior  asset quality, and good liquidity and risk-adjusted capitalization. STRONG GROWTH IN LEASING Ford Credit's managed portfolio increased 17% to $132 billion at quarter-end  1Q16 from $113 billion at 1Q15 primarily driven by an increase in net operating  leases, which grew 18% year over year. The lease portfolio reached $25.9 billion  at 1Q16, but is still below the pre-crisis peak of $29.7 billion in 2007. Fitch  notes that leasing can be a riskier strategy than lending as it exposes the  company to residual value risk outside of the recovery values on defaulted  loans, particularly when used car values have remained elevated in recent years  and are expected to weaken as the number of vehicles coming off lease increases  over the next few years. However, Fitch believes that Ford Credit has a solid  track record of managing its residual value exposure and expects the company to  be prudent in setting residual values on new lease originations. PROFITABILITY STABLE Operating performance improved 1Q16 versus 1Q15 as loan/lease growth and a  higher net interest margin more than offset a near doubling of the loan loss  provision and downward pressure on residual values of leases stemming from lower  auction prices. Fitch expects Ford Credit will generate solid profitability in  2016 but does not expect a significant improvement over 2015, as record SAAR  volume posted in 2015 stabilizes, resulting in more moderate loan/lease growth  and credit performance begins to normalize toward historical levels which should  result in higher loan loss provisions. SOLID ASSET QUALITY  Asset quality continues to perform favorably compared to peers with Ford Credit  reporting a global loss-to-receivables ratio of 0.29% in 1Q16 versus 0.22% in  1Q15. Fitch expects asset quality will continue to normalize given portfolio  seasoning and softening in used car prices. The average severity of loss in the  U.S. market increased to $9,800 per vehicle in 1Q16, up 18% y/y. The higher  severity of loss is the result of lower auction values on vehicles, higher  balances at repossession (longer avg. loan terms), and higher amounts financed.  Allowance for loan losses has been prudently managed and measured 0.35% globally  at 1Q16, offering a reasonable coverage level over net losses. ELEVATED LEVERAGE Managed leverage, calculated by Ford Credit, measured 9.4x at 1Q16, down  slightly from 9.5x at YE 2015, but up from 8.8x a year ago and is above the  higher end of management's target range of 8x - 9x although the support  agreement allows for up to 11.5x. In order to bring leverage back down to within  the targeted range, the company plans to forgo dividends to the parent in 2016,  which when coupled with more moderate asset growth in 2016, should result in  lower leverage. Fitch believes Ford Credit's higher leverage relative to other  captives is reflective of its higher quality loan/lease portfolio, which has  shown superior credit performance relative to many of its captive peers.  Nevertheless, leverage remains higher than standalone finance company peers.  Funding and liquidity continue to improve as the company is continuing to reduce  its reliance on secured funding sources, which should offer greater funding  flexibility in times of stress and result in a larger pool of unencumbered  assets benefiting unsecured creditors. Short-term debt, both on an absolute basis and as a percentage of total debt,  has been declining post-crisis. Fitch recognizes the motivation to fund short  term, as short-term funding is generally less costly. However, overreliance on  short-term funding adds to refinancing/liquidity risk during times of market  stress, and so Fitch views the lower reliance on short-term funding by Ford  Credit positively. Currently, short-term debt is at a reasonable level of Ford  Credit's total debt (9.4% at 1Q16), especially considering the short duration  assets such as the commercial floorplan receivables and auto leases. A material  increase in short-term funding would be viewed negatively by Fitch. The upgrade of Ford Credit's short-term IDR to 'F2' from 'F3' reflects potential  liquidity support available from Ford as well as Ford Credit's good standalone  liquidity profile, in terms of the short duration of its assets relative to its  overall debt, a relatively low reliance on commercial paper issuance, high asset  quality, and strong cash flow generation capacity. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  positive rating action include: --Maintaining a North American automotive EBIT margin above 10% on a sustained  basis; --Maintaining a global automotive EBIT margin above 4% on a sustained basis; --Maintaining a FCF margin of 2% or higher; --Continued progress toward reducing automotive debt to $10 billion by 2018; --Further sales growth in developing regions. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --A decision to reduce the company's automotive cash target to below $20  billion; --A sustained period of negative FCF, excluding non-recurring items; --A shift away from the company's debt-reduction activities, particularly to  fund shareholder-friendly activities; --An unexpected merger or acquisition that materially weakens the company's  credit profile.  RATING SENSITIVITIES: FORD CREDIT The LT IDRs, senior unsecured ratings and Rating Outlook for Ford Credit are  linked to the ratings of Ford. As such, Ford Credit's ratings will move in  tandem with any changes in the parent's ratings. Any change in Fitch's view on  whether Ford Credit remains a core subsidiary could change this rating linkage  and result in Ford Credit being rated lower than Ford. Finally, were Ford or  Ford Credit's liquidity profile to materially deteriorate, this could result in  Ford Credit's ST IDR being downgraded to 'F3' from 'F3' even if the LT IDR was  unchanged.  A sustained, material increase in leverage, an inability to access funding for  an extended period of time, and/or significant deterioration in the credit  quality of the underlying loan and lease portfolio, could become constraining  factors on the parent's ratings. Fitch cannot currently envision a scenario  where Ford Credit would be rated higher than the parent. Fitch is withdrawing the ratings of Ford Credit Australia Ltd., Ford Credit Co.  S.A. de C.V., and Ford Motor Credit Co. of New Zealand Ltd. as these issuers no  longer exist. Accordingly, Fitch will no longer provide ratings or analytical  coverage for these issuers.

981,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. manufacturing grew for a third straight month in May, but factories appeared to be taking in fewer deliveries from their suppliers, which could hamper production in the months ahead.Other data on Wednesday showed automobile sales slowing last month and a sharp drop in construction spending in April, bucking the recent flow of relatively strong data that suggested economic growth was regaining speed in the second quarter.The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity rose half a percentage point to a reading of 51.3 last month, with a jump in prices paid by factories for raw materials also accounting for the increase.A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy. The ISM's supplier deliveries sub-index surged five points to a reading of 54.1 last month. A reading above 50 in this index indicates slower deliveries.""The rise in the ISM exaggerates the underlying tone in the U.S. manufacturing sector. While the jump in supplier deliveries is a good thing from an inventory perspective, it is perhaps a signal of weaker production activity ahead,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.U.S. stocks were little changed, while the dollar fell against a basket of currencies. Prices for longer-dated U.S. government debt rose. Manufacturing remains constrained by the lingering effects of the dollar's surge and oil price plunge between June 2014 and December 2015. The sector has also been hurt by business efforts to reduce an inventory glut, which has resulted in fewer orders being placed with factories. Although the dollar's rally is fading and oil prices are steadily rising, economists do not expect a strong bounce back in factory activity. New orders received by factories were little changed in May, production tumbled and order backlogs shrank. New export orders were unchanged and factory employment continued to contract. There was also an increase in the number of manufacturers reporting that customers' inventories were too high.PERSISTENT WEAKNESS  While the ISM index has remained in expansion territory for three consecutive months, so-called hard manufacturing data has been generally weak. The government reported last week that orders for long-lasting manufactured capital goods, excluding defense and aircraft, fell in April for a third straight month.A separate manufacturing survey from data firm Markit showed factory activity in May was the weakest since September 2009.""A turnaround in manufacturing is going to take time, it's not going to happen overnight,"" said Ryan Sweet, senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.Separately, reports from auto manufacturers showed weak demand for sedans and fewer selling days holding down motor vehicle sales in May. Ford Motor Co (F.N), reported a 6 percent drop in sales last month from a year earlier. It estimated overall U.S. sales would decrease by about 8 percent in May.   General Motors Co (GM.N), the largest U.S. automaker, reported an 18 percent decline in sales last month. Weak auto sales would suggest a slowdown in consumer spending in May after posting its largest increase since August 2009 in April.A third report from the Commerce Department showed     construction spending tumbled 1.8 percent, the largest decline since January 2011, after an upwardly revised 1.5 percent jump in March. Construction spending was previously reported to have increased 0.3 percent in March.The weak auto sales and construction reports interrupted the stream of bullish data - including consumer spending, industrial production, goods exports and housing - which have bolstered views the economy was regaining speed after growth braked to a 0.8 percent annualized rate in the first quarter.As a result of the soft report, the Atlanta Federal Reserve cut its second-quarter gross domestic product estimate by four-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.5 percent rate.However, the sharp upward revision to March's construction spending suggests the government's first-quarter GDP growth estimate could be revised higher.

986,"  DETROIT, June 1 The U.S. auto industry looks set to remain on course for another record year in 2016, even if new vehicle sales in May reported later on Wednesday fall as much as expected, analysts and economists said.Forty economists polled by Thomson Reuters expect on average a seasonally adjusted selling rate of 17.3 million vehicles for May, not greatly changed from April but down from 17.8 million a year earlier.Most analysts expect a year-on-year drop in sales, in large part because of two fewer selling days and one less weekend this past month.Edmunds.com said sales would be down 5.8 percent from a year earlier, while fellow industry consultancy TrueCar estimated a 4 percent decline. All but one of the top-for selling automakers in the U.S. market are expected to report lower sales. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  sales were seen unchanged by Edmunds and rising 1.2 percent by TrueCar.General Motors Co sales were seen dropping 13 percent by Edmunds and 8 percent by TrueCar. Ford Motor Co sales were seen down 3 percent by Edmunds and 5 percent by TrueCar. Toyota Motor Corp sales were forecast to fall 9 percent by Edmunds and 8 percent by TrueCar. Consultancies J.D.

988,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI) are cutting production of smaller cars and idling workers at some North American factories, while boosting output of sport utility vehicles in reaction to a long-term shift toward larger vehicles, the companies said on Tuesday.The Detroit-area plant that makes the slow-selling Ford Focus and C-Max compact cars will shut an additional five weeks through the end of this year, Ford told Reuters. Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said company executives earlier this year saw demand for small cars slowing and planned the extra downtime. The factory employs about 2,445 hourly workers, most of whom will be laid off when the plant is idled.U.S. consumers have increasingly favored SUVs and pickup trucks over traditional cars like sedans and hatchbacks. Car sales made up about 42 percent of U.S. new-vehicle sales in the first five months of this year. That compares with about 46 percent in the same period of 2015, and 51 percent in 2013, when U.S. gasoline prices were still averaging above $3 a gallon.The U.S. government has forecast gasoline prices will average about $2.27 a gallon this summer. As gas prices have fallen, so has demand for smaller cars such as the Focus. U.S. sales of the model are down 12 percent through the first five months of this year. At the same time, auto makers are revving up production of sport utility vehicles and trucks. Ford said on Tuesday that five of its U.S. and Canadian plants that make SUVs or heavy duty trucks will have one rather than the normal two weeks of summer shutdown in order to keep up with robust demand.Among the plants with reduced downtime due to high demand is the Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, which makes the Ford Escape, one of the top-selling SUVs in the United States.  Fiat Chrysler said that five of its plants in the United States and Mexico will not have any summer shutdowns this year and three other factories will shorten the normal two weeks of downtime to a single week.FCA said previously that it plans on July 5 to cut a shift at its Detroit-area plant that makes the light-selling midsize  Chrysler 200, indefinitely laying off 1,300 workers.No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co (GM.N) said it would not divulge its North American summer plant schedule. In April, after an earthquake in Japan cut supplies of some auto parts, GM chose to send parts it had to pickup truck and SUV plants and shut for two weeks four plants that mostly make cars.

990,"   By Andreas Cremer | BERLIN  BERLIN Ford (F.N) warned on Thursday that potential future investment in the United Kingdom could be at risk if a vote to leave the European Union leads to a significant deterioration in the country's business environment.Ford is turning the corner in Europe after years of losses, recording its highest quarterly pretax profit since 2008 in the first three months of 2016 as it reduces personnel costs and sells more higher-margin cars.In an interview with Reuters, Ford Europe Chief Executive Jim Farley said the U.S. automaker's ""primary interest"" was to maintain stability to increase its business further in the United Kingdom, its largest market in Europe.""If the UK left the EU, it could create economic instability and uncertainty, the full consequences of which are unknown generally and, specifically, to our business,"" Farley said.He declined to say whether Ford had a contingency plan in place if the United Kingdom votes to leave on June 23 but indicated that investment could be at risk if it withdrew.  ""Should a vote to leave lead to a significant deterioration in the UK's business conditions and trade environment then that could impact business decision-making, including potential future investment,"" the CEO said.The U.S. automaker has already sent a letter to its 14,000 UK employees saying it would be better if Britain, which is Europe's second biggest car market, stays in the EU. Campaigners seeking to keep Britain in the EU have also said the country's role as a global financial hub could be under threat if it gives up its membership, resulting in job losses.Farley, an American who has led Ford's operations in Europe since January 2015, wants the EU to improve regulations to make industries more competitive and to rework a free trade deal with South Korea that he says discriminates against mass-market carmakers such as Ford.""We believe the UK staying as a member of a reformed EU is the best way of maintaining stability and avoiding uncertainty in the trading environment,"" he said. The U.S. automaker's operations in Britain include three plants making engines and transmissions, a technical center in Dunton with 3,000 employees, the Ford Credit Europe (FCE) banking arm and a dealer network with 600 service points.The FCE, which offers retail, leasing and other financial services to Ford dealers and customers in 15 European countries, depends on its ability to operate across the region using an EU passporting arrangement, Farley said.

994,"   By Paul Lienert | DETROIT  DETROIT Faraday Future plans to begin testing prototype self-driving electric vehicles on California roads later this year after winning approval from the state, an industry source said on Tuesday.The China-backed, Los Angeles-based startup plans to begin building and selling electric vehicles next year in the United States, but has not disclosed details of its self-driving program.A spokesperson from the California Department of Motor Vehicles on Tuesday confirmed that Faraday had been approved to test self-driving vehicles on public roads on June 17.Faraday is one of several Chinese-funded startups hoping to challenge Tesla Motors Inc in premium electric vehicles. Like Tesla, Faraday also hopes to add self-driving capability to its vehicles, but has not provided a timetable. Faraday has been testing prototype vehicles for the past year at private facilities, according to the source familiar with the company's program.Jan Becker, senior director of automated driving at Faraday's San Jose tech center, said in an early June interview with Reuters that the company's electric vehicles would have ""state of the art driver assistance systems."" Such systems provide the foundation for full self-driving capability.Becker declined to give specifics on the company's plans to add self-driving capability, but said such systems, when introduced, would offer automatic over-the-air software updates similar to those provided by Tesla. California previously approved 13 companies to test autonomous vehicles on public roads, most recently two Silicon Valley startups, Zoox and Drive.ai, funded by venture investors. The state's Department of Motor Vehicles also has approved testing by Cruise Automation, which was acquired earlier this year by General Motors Co.Other approved testers include Alphabet Inc's Google, Tesla, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, Nissan Motor Co, BMW AG, Honda Motor Co and Ford Motor Co, and auto suppliers Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] and Delphi Automotive.

The indexes have erased almost all their losses stemming from the ""Brexit"" vote.""Clearly, people have assessed that either, one, it's not a big deal, or, two, it’s not going to happen at all, and they’re positioning according to those views,"" said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 19.38 points, or 0.11 percent, to 17,949.37, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 4.09 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,102.95 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 19.90 points, or 0.41 percent, to 4,862.57.Seven of the 10 major S&P sectors ended higher, with the consumer discretionary group's .SPLRCD 0.9-percent rise leading the gainers. Financials .SPSY were the worst performing group, slipping 0.5 percent.""It’s encouraging that the market has held on to the post-Brexit recovery that we’ve had,"" said Peter Jankovskis, co-­chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois. With Wall Street's post-Brexit rebound, the S&P 500 is up nearly 3 percent for the year and ended the week less than 30 points from its record closing high. Still, some investors believe political and economic uncertainty stemming from Britain's vote could throw off markets in the weeks to come.Data on Friday showed U.S. factory activity expanded at a healthy pace in June as new orders, output and exports rose,  providing another sign that U.S. manufacturing was regaining its footing after weakness early this year.""It's been a wild ride, but positive economic momentum in the United States has and continues to be a ray of sunshine,"" said Daniel Kern, chief investment strategist of TFC Financial Management in Boston. Government bond yields around the world hit their lowest levels in years, driven by the prospect of further cuts in interest rates and more central bank bond buying to support weak economies.Ford (F.N) shares rose 1.2 percent and GM (GM.N) gained 2.1 percent. Robust demand for pickups and SUVs pushed up U.S. auto sales in June but the growth fell short of estimates.Harley-Davidson's (HOG.N) shares jumped 19.8 percent after unsubstantiated market chatter that the motorcycle company might be a takeover target. The stock was the top percentage gainer on the S&P. Micron Technology (MU.O) fell 9.2 percent after the chipmaker posted disappointing sales and said it would cut jobs.About 6.7 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the roughly 7.7 billion average over the past 20 sessions, ahead of the July Fourth holiday in the United States.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,918 to 1,088, for a 1.76-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,767 issues rose and 1,060 fell for a 1.67-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 posted 89 new 52-week highs and no new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 98 new highs and 11 new lows.

1003,"   By Allison Lampert | MONTREAL  MONTREAL Detroit's Big Three automakers on Monday reported higher Canadian sales for June and for the first half of 2016, on an annual basis, with forecasters expecting another record-breaking year.June sales hit a new record for the month, rising 7.4 percent to 191,088 on an annual basis, according to Canadian auto analyst Dennis DesRosiers on Monday. Sales of trucks, SUVs and vans grew 13.9 percent, even as sluggish sales of sedans declined 2.9 percent on an annual basis, he wrote in a note.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI), reported a total of 27,776 vehicles sold in June, up 2 percent compared with the same month in 2015. For the first half of 2016, FCA Canada said it sold 152,439 vehicles, a record high for the automaker.“At the mid-year point, FCA Canada is on pace for another record-setting sales year,” said Dave Buckingham, ChiefOperating Officer, FCA Canada, in a statement. According to a June report by Scotiabank, Canadian auto sales are expected to rise to 1.96 million vehicles in 2016, up from a record-breaking 1.9 million units last year.In May, Canadian auto sales slipped 1.5 percent on an annual basis, the first monthly decline since December 2015, in part because the month had two fewer selling days.""The market rebounded strongly in June after a slower month in May,"" DesRosiers said. ""Sales finished 6.0 percent higher for the first half of 2016, without a clear sign of slowing down.""   Ford Motor Co (F.N) and General Motors Co (GM.N), reported higher Canadian sales in June, which had 26 selling days, compared to 25 during the same month in 2015. Ford said in a news release it sold 28,718 vehicles in June, up 7 percent for the month. Ford's sales during the first half of 2016 rose nearly 12 percent to 149,942 vehicles. GM delivered 26,045 vehicles in June, up 8 percent on an annual basis. GM said its sales for the first six months of 2016 rose 2.3 percent to 130,202 units. Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) sold 22,004 vehicles in June, up 6.4 percent compared to 2015. Sales for the first half of the year reached 113,410 units, up 8 percent on an annual basis.In the United States, which reported results on July 1, the pace of auto sales slowed in June compared to a year ago, as slumping sales of sedans offset strong demand for pickups and sport utility vehicles.

1015,"  STOCKHOLM Geely-owned automaker Volvo Car Group reported its operating earnings tripled in the first half and said a further roll-out of new, more up-market models left it confident about reaching record sales and earnings for the full year.Bought by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. from Ford Motor Co. (F.N) in 2010, Volvo said operating earnings rose to 5.59 billion Swedish crowns ($649.8 million) from 1.66 billion.One of Sweden's biggest companies by sales and staff numbers, Volvo is banking on a 75 billion crown investment plan in new models and plants to secure a foothold in a premium market where it had struggled to make inroads under Ford's tutelage.Gothenburg-based Volvo saw sales rise to 83.65 billion crowns from 75.22 billion a year ago underpinned by strong demand for its flagship XC90 SUV.It said the launch of its S90 sedan and V90 estate would provide a boost in the second half. ""This robust first half financial and operational performance combined with a positive product pipeline allows me to state confidently that Volvo Cars expects to report another record full year in 2016 in terms of sales and profitability,"" Volvo Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement.Samuelsson gave an upbeat outlook for auto markets in the second half after Volvo, which competes with larger rivals such as Daimler's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz and BMW (BMWG.DE), grew unit sales by 10.5 percent in the first six months of 2016.  ""We are positive about the development in the U.S. as well as in Europe, where we are both taking market share and have a strong underlying market which after many years is finally coming back,"" Samuelsson told Reuters. ""In China, above all in the premium segment, we expect further steady growth.""Launch costs for the new S90 and V90 models meant Volvo's operating margin dipped relative to that reported for the first quarter, but it still stood at 6.7 percent versus the 2.2 percent posted in the first half of last year. Samuelsson said costs related to the launches would continue to have an impact in the third quarter.

1016,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON U.S. companies operating in Venezuela have escalated the use of an accounting maneuver to insulate themselves from a worsening economic crisis in the South American country that has erased more than $10 billion in profits over the past 18 months. A growing number of U.S. companies, including Colgate-Palmolive, Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo, began deconsolidating the financial results of their Venezuelan operations in 2015 because of the plunging value of the country's bolivar currency and their inability to set prices on products such as shampoo and laundry detergent. The OPEC nation's unprecedented economic collapse has caused massive shortages, forcing tens of thousands of Venezuelans to stream across the border for basic goods.Deconsolidation means that Venezuela operations can largely no longer hurt or benefit a U.S. parent company's financial results. Often companies are taking a big one-time charge against earnings so that they can ring-fence what is left in Venezuela. Avon Products Inc took an after-tax loss of about $120 million in the first quarter as part of its deconsolidation move. Meanwhile, companies around the globe that have not deconsolidated their Venezuela operations are suffering hits to their income statements. Or they have signaled future writedowns if the country's economy remains in severe distress.Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, for example, said in May it still has about $350 million worth of assets exposed to Venezuela's currency. The company took a $246-million impairment charge in the first quarter following the devaluation of Venezuela's currency.  Devaluations and one of the world's highest inflation rates have forced Teva and a slew of other companies to mark down the value of their assets using less favorable exchange rates. The last official inflation reading from the central bank came in February, and was 180.9 percent. At the start of 2015, many companies valued their assets using the then-official exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars per dollar. But getting that most favorable rate under a multi-tier currency system was unrealistic amid a severe shortage of dollars. In March, Venezuela announced the creation of two new exchange rates. The so-called Dipro rate of 10 bolivars per dollar is mainly for priority food and medicines. The other is a floating rate that adjusts based on supply and demand. It has weakened to 641 bolivars per dollar. And on the black market, one dollar costs Venezuelans more than 1,000 bolivars, according to currency website dolartoday.com.  Several U.S., European and Asian drug companies have reduced shipments of medicine because they are not able to exchange bolivars for dollars. Pfizer Inc has disclosed in regulatory filings that it may not be able to operate in Venezuela as it has historically. Automaker General Motors Co said its Venezuelan operations may need additional financial support, but no decision has been made to provide it.""GM has affirmed the continued consolidation of our Venezuelan subsidiaries and the potential for additional financial support for the past four quarters,"" GM spokeswoman Jenna Pearson said, declining additional comment.  In early 2015, Ford Motor Co wrote off its investment in Venezuela when it took an $800 million pre-tax writedown.   Deconsolidation will likely remain an attractive option for foreign companies with Venezuelan subsidiaries, which routinely say they cannot access hard currency, obtain raw materials, lay off workers or raise prices to compensate for inflation. The maneuver also allows them to avoid the drip-drip of losses from Venezuela that have hurt the earnings at so many companies.

1028,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. consumer spending rose more than expected in June as households bought goods and services, suggesting strength that appeared to be sustained early in the third quarter with auto sales surging to an eight-month high in July.Despite healthy consumer spending, Tuesday's report from the Commerce Department showed inflation still muted. Economists say this, together with weak business investment and the second quarter's anemic economic growth pace, could encourage a cautious Federal Reserve to keep interest rates at current low levels for a while. ""The continued buoyancy in consumption expenditures points to a favorable handoff to the third quarter, but the soft price pressures add to the narrative of the weakening inflationary backdrop, which will argue for caution at the Fed,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, increased 0.4 percent in June after a similar gain in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending advancing 0.3 percent.When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.3 percent after climbing 0.2 percent in May.The June data was included in last week's second-quarter gross domestic product report, which showed that consumer spending rose at a 4.2 percent annual rate, the fastest in nearly two years. That jump accounted for almost all of the economy's 1.2 percent growth pace during the period. An inventory drawdown was behind the bulk of the economy's poor performance in the second quarter, with other drags coming from persistently weak business investment, as well as a decline in spending on residential construction and weak government outlays.Separately, auto sales rose to a 17.88 million-unit annual rate last month, the highest since November 2015, from a 16.74 million-unit pace in June, according to data from Autodata. Analysts had expected sales to increase to a 17.3 million unit rate.  ""As the earliest reliable indicator of durable goods consumption, today's sales results bode well for real July consumption growth,"" said Jesse Hurwitz, an economist at Barclays in New York.The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasuries slipped and stocks on Wall Street ended down.SOLID HANDOFF  While the second quarter's robust pace of consumer spending will probably not be repeated, economists are optimistic that spending will remain solid, underpinned by steadily increasing wages as the labor market tightens, as well as rising house and stock market prices.The rebound in auto sales came despite General Motors Co (GM.N) reporting a 2 percent drop. Ford Motor Co (F.N) also reported a 3 percent decline in sales last month. ""The solid handoff to the quarter suggests consumer spending will downshift only moderately in the third quarter, assisted by an expected rebound in unit auto sales in July,"" said Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.""Another decent quarter for consumers, together with renewed inventory building, should anchor a near doubling in real GDP growth in the third quarter.""  There was little sign of inflation in June. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, excluding the volatile food and energy components, rose 0.1 percent in June after a 0.2 percent gain in May.In the 12 months through June the core PCE increased 1.6 percent. It has risen by the same margin since March. The core PCE is the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure and is running below the U.S. central bank's 2 percent target. Consumer spending in June was lifted by a 0.7 percent rise in purchases of non-durable goods. Spending on services increased 0.5 percent, but outlays on long-lasting manufactured goods such as automobiles fell 0.3 percent. Spending increased despite personal income rising only 0.2 percent in June after a similar gain in May. Wages and salaries advanced 0.3 percent after rising 0.2 percent in May. With spending outpacing income, savings fell to $732 billion, the lowest level since March 2015.""The good news is that this still leaves at least some scope for households to draw on their savings in the second half of the year,"" said Steve Murphy, a U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.

1032,"  * Bond yields up globally on doubts of central bank support* US dollar broadly lower as more US data disappoints* Bank shares under pressure, energy hit by falling oilBy Wayne ColeSYDNEY, Aug 3 Asian shares slid on Wednesday while the yen lorded over a weakened U.S dollar as fears that the Bank of Japan may retreat from its massive bond-buying campaign added to a shakeout in debt markets globally.Futures also pointed to early losses for major European stock markets and a softer opening on Wall Street.Worryingly for energy shares, the broad-based decline in the dollar was still not enough to spare U.S. crude oil from its first finish under $40 a barrel since April.Adding to the jittery mood was a renewed selloff in bank stocks following stress tests in Europe.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan  slid 1.3 percent, backing away from its recent one-year peak.Japan's Nikkei shed 1.9 percent as the rising yen pressured exporters' stocks while financials slid 4 percent. Shanghai was nearly flat, with a private survey showing growth in China's services sector cooled in July and companies shed staff for first time in four months.The sharpest moves have been in sovereign bond markets where a sudden spike in yields stirred speculation that a multi-year bull run in prices might finally be nearing its end.While Japanese bonds steadied on Wednesday they have still suffered the worst sell-off in over three years as investors feared the BoJ was out of easing ammunition and might leave it to fiscal policy to stimulate the economy.Tokyo on Tuesday approved 13.5 trillion yen ($132 billion) in fiscal measures and the IMF urged Japan to mix fiscal stimulus with labour market reforms. Bond bulls were worried the Bank of England might also under-deliver at its policy meeting on Thursday, putting the onus on debt-funded government spending to support growth.""With Japan and the UK set to ease fiscal policy, it will be important to watch whether we are at the beginning of a global policy re-pivot away from monetary easing,"" wrote analysts at ANZ in a note.NO FED HIKE UNTIL 2018? The ripples spread all the way to U.S. Treasuries, where 30-year yields hit their highest since July 21 even though domestic data were generally soft. Disappointing auto sales slugged shares in Ford  and General Motors, which both dropped more than 4 percent.The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Tuesday down 0.49 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.64 percent and the Nasdaq 0.9 percent.The recent outbreak of weaker U.S. data has further pushed back expectations for when the Federal Reserve might hike rates -- the market is not fully priced for a move until well into 2018 -- and taken a heavy toll on the dollar.The dollar touched a near six-week trough against a basket of currencies, while the euro reached its highest since mid-July around $1.1230.Against the yen, the dollar was at 101.03 yen having got as low as 100.75 and down from 105.33 in just four sessions.In commodity markets, oil prices steadied in Asia but remained vulnerable to worries about a glut in both crude and refined product.Brent crude edged up a cent to $41.81 but remained near four-month lows reached on Wednesday. NYMEX crude  added 2 cents to $39.54 a barrel, but was still under the psychological $40 level.(Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by Sam Holmes and Kim Coghill)",2016-08-03,F,"Wed Aug 3, 2016 | 2:17am EDT","GLOBAL MARKETS-Bonds shaken by stimulus doubts, dollar on defensive",http://www.reuters.com//article/global-markets-idUSL3N1AJ5CZ?type=companyNews

He said Ford may choose not to partner, and roll out such services on its own.Ford's announcement leaves many crucial strategy details still undecided. Yet Ken Washington, Ford's vice president of research, said it was important to signal that Ford intends to win in this space, even with key elements still unknown.""We're saying to partners, we are the winning partner. It's not a hollow promise, it's a real intent,"" Washington said. Ford Chief Technical Officer Raj Nair said the company likely will not offer a similar driverless car without steering wheel or pedals to consumers until 2025 or later. Launching a self-driving car first for ride-sharing is a better way to reach the mass market and make the cars more affordable, he said.In a philosophy shared by Alphabet's Google, Ford does not intend to develop incremental autonomous systems that would occasionally require drivers to take the wheel, instead committing to a full self-driving car.""We abandoned the stepping-stone approach,"" Fields said, saying there are too many risks involved in the safe ""hand-over"" of driving responsibility between car and driver.  The death of a Tesla driver in May who was using the company's ""Autopilot"" system but had his hands off the wheel has underscored the confusion over drivers' responsibilities in a semi-autonomous car.Ford also said it had, along with Baidu Inc - China's largest internet company - jointly invested $150 million in Velodyne, which makes laser-based sensors that are a major building block in self-driving cars. Nair said Ford's investment was $75 million.Earlier this year, Ford invested in Silicon Valley firm, Civil Maps, for advanced mapping for self-driving vehicles.

1047,"   By Aditi Shah and Paul Lienert | NEW DELHI/DETROIT  NEW DELHI/DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) has shelved plans to produce a new compact car family designed mainly for emerging markets like India and China, industry sources said, reflecting disappointing sales of mainstream models in the world's fastest growing car markets.    India and China were expected to be the main manufacturing hubs for the new B500 range, slated to begin production in 2018 and to include a premium sedan, hatchback and sport utility vehicle (SUV), two sources with direct knowledge of Ford's plans told Reuters.The automaker had also planned to build its new models in Brazil, Russia and Thailand, one of the sources said.Ford's decision, communicated to its suppliers in July, follows a similar move by General Motors (GM.N) to postpone the launch in India of a new $5 billion family of compact vehicles.Ford is now planning to redesign the EcoSport, Figo and Figo Aspire in India in 2020-2021, according to two separate U.S. sources familiar with Ford's plans.Its more ambitious B500 program, though, is on ice because of muted demand for some small and mid-sized hatchbacks and sedans in India and China, where SUVs and ""crossovers"" combining the hatchback and SUV have proved increasingly popular.The cost of upgrading plants to produce the new cars would also be prohibitively high, the first sources said.All of the sources declined to be named as they have not been cleared to discuss the plans publicly.Ford declined to comment on the development.""We are constantly evaluating opportunities to better meet the needs of consumers and do not comment on speculation about future product programmes,"" a Ford spokesman said in a statement.SHIFT TO SUVS  That said, Ford has invested over $2 billion in India and plans to spend more to set up a global engineering center in the southern city of Chennai that will help tweak products for the local market and more swiftly adapt to changing consumer trends.The carmaker is also ramping up exports, including to Europe, to maximize usage of its two plants in India.""India is a key market for us in Asia Pacific,"" said the spokesman, adding that the carmaker is committed to introducing new products and technologies in the South Asian nation.But instead of the bigger plan for the key markets of India and China, Ford will focus on updating existing models and develop and build more SUVs and crossovers, moving away from sedans and hatchbacks, the U.S. sources said.That would allow the carmaker to boost profit margins.""The global shift to crossovers makes competing in small cars a tough proposition for GM and Ford,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at U.S.-based AutoForecast Solutions. ""It makes more sense for them to refresh older products now, harness lower development costs in China in the mid-term, and move toward small crossovers over the long haul.""Chinese buyers have flocked to SUVs, as they grow wealthier and are often restricted to one vehicle in major cities, at the expense of contracting sedan sales.SUV sales rose 52 percent last year, although a glut of new model launches in the segment is already leading to discounts and lower margins.    Growing competition in the small SUV segment from local Chinese carmakers is also putting more pressure on pricing. SETBACK FOR ""MAKE IN INDIA""  The retreat by Ford and GM is a setback for India's ""Make in India"" push to become a global manufacturing powerhouse, including in the auto sector.Retooling the assembly line to build the B500 vehicles at Ford's plant in Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state, would have meant an investment of more than $100 million and created manufacturing jobs as it cranked out more cars.Ford and GM have struggled to crack emerging markets in Asia, where competition from Japanese, South Korean and now Chinese automakers is fierce.GM shut production in Indonesia owing to its modest market share, and Ford also plans to close its operations in the Southeast Asian nation, as well as in Japan and Australia.    Dearborn-based Ford is now looking at each country in the region in terms of long-term profitability opportunities, said another source familiar with Ford's plans, while noting India remains a tough place to make money.India's passenger car market, where sales rose 7 percent last fiscal year to 2.8 million units, is dominated by Maruti Suzuki (MRTI.NS) and Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) with their extensive line-up of cars and vast dealer networks. Maruti and Hyundai control two-thirds of the market whereas Ford's share in India, set to be the world's third-largest car market by 2020, has stagnated at about 3 percent.Until Ford finalizes an alternative plan, the shift in strategy could leave gaps in its car portfolio in India, that today sits at the two ends of the price and size spectrum.In the meantime, Ford is increasing its focus on driving down costs by sourcing more parts locally and using more common features across models to achieve economies of scale.

But instead of the bigger plan for the key markets of India and China, Ford will focus on updating existing models and develop and build more SUVs and crossovers, moving away from sedans and hatchbacks, the U.S. sources said.That would allow the carmaker to boost profit margins.""The global shift to crossovers makes competing in small cars a tough proposition for GM and Ford,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at U.S.-based AutoForecast Solutions.""It makes more sense for them to refresh older products now, harness lower development costs in China in the mid-term, and move toward small crossovers over the long haul.""Chinese buyers have flocked to SUVs, as they grow wealthier and are often restricted to one vehicle in major cities, at the expense of contracting sedan sales.SUV sales rose 52 percent last year, although a glut of new model launches in the segment is already leading to discounts and lower margins.Growing competition in the small SUV segment from local Chinese carmakers is also putting more pressure on pricing. SETBACK FOR ""MAKE IN INDIA"" The retreat by Ford and GM is a setback for India's ""Make in India"" push to become a global manufacturing powerhouse, including in the auto sector.Retooling the assembly line to build the B500 vehicles at Ford's plant in Gujarat, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state, would have meant an investment of more than $100 million and created manufacturing jobs as it cranked out more cars.Ford and GM have struggled to crack emerging markets in Asia, where competition from Japanese, South Korean and now Chinese automakers is fierce.GM shut production in Indonesia owing to its modest market share, and Ford also plans to close its operations in the Southeast Asian nation, as well as in Japan and Australia.Dearborn-based Ford is now looking at each country in the region in terms of long-term profitability opportunities, said another source familiar with Ford's plans, while noting India remains a tough place to make money.India's passenger car market, where sales rose 7 percent last fiscal year to 2.8 million units, is dominated by Maruti Suzuki and Hyundai Motor Co with their extensive line-up of cars and vast dealer networks.Maruti and Hyundai control two-thirds of the market whereas Ford's share in India, set to be the world's third-largest car market by 2020, has stagnated at about 3 percent.Until Ford finalises an alternative plan, the shift in strategy could leave gaps in its car portfolio in India, that today sits at the two ends of the price and size spectrum.In the meantime, Ford is increasing its focus on driving down costs by sourcing more parts locally and using more common features across models to achieve economies of scale.(Additional reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu in Beijing; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Euan Rocha)",2016-09-05,F,"Mon Sep 5, 2016 | 4:58am EDT","RPT-EXCLUSIVE-Ford shelves compact car programme for emerging markets, setback for India",http://www.reuters.com//article/india-autos-ford-motor-repeat-update-1-e-idUSL8N1BH1K5?type=companyNews
1049,"  (Recasts with comments from union leader on potential impact of strike)By Allison MartellTORONTO, Sept 6 Canada's main autoworkers' union on Tuesday named General Motors Co as its strike target in contract talks, and its top official warned that any walkout could disrupt the automaker's production across North America.Bargaining with the Canadian arms of GM, Ford Motor Co  and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles kicked off in August. The union, Unifor National, typically selects one company for intensive negotiations. That company's deal sets a pattern, and other auto manufacturers are expected to agree to similar contracts.Union President Jerry Dias set a strike deadline of Sept. 19, the expiration date for four-year contracts covering GM, Fiat Chrysler and Ford.Among GM plants that could be hit by a strike are the St Catharines, Ontario, powertrain facility, which supplies engines to the company's CAMI plant in Ingersoll, Ontario. The CAMI plant assembles the strong-selling Chevrolet Equinox and the GMC Terrain.While CAMI workers would not walk out in any strike because they work under a separate labor contract, Dias said the union's members at CAMI would not accept engines from other sites. ""The reality is we are not going to accept engines from anywhere else to go into our CAMI facility,"" Dias said in an interview. ""General Motors would be foolish to attempt to ship in engines from somewhere else.""Dias also said he expected U.S. plants represented by the United Auto Workers would not increase output to replace production from St Catharines.""I would expect that the UAW will respect any action that we have here in Canada,"" he said.A UAW spokesman said the union's president, Dennis Williams, was traveling and unavailable for comment. ""I'm not sure how sympathetic the UAW would be because one of the issues could be taking product away from them,"" said Arthur Schwartz, a labor analyst and former GM negotiator.At an earlier news conference, Dias said he does not expect a strike, but added that the carmaker must change course and announce investment plans before any deal is ratified. FOCUSING ON AN AGREEMENT ""We continue to remain focused on finding a new agreement that is mutually beneficial and competitive,"" said David Paterson, GM Canada's vice president for corporate and environmental affairs.He did not repeat the company's longstanding stance that it cannot make any investment decisions until after a new labor contract is signed. GM declined to comment on the impact of a shutdown at St Catharines.Kristin Dziczek, labor analyst at the Center of Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said there is no obvious candidate for GM vehicle production to be added at Oshawa, Ontario, which is a union priority.""You've got to take the chance of a strike seriously,"" said Dziczek. ""These are tough issues they've got to get over.""The Oshawa plant has one assembly line scheduled to shut down in 2017. On its newer flex line, it builds the Cadillac XTS, which is not a strong seller, the Buick Regal, which sources have told Reuters will likely move to China or Europe in 2017, and the Chevrolet Impala, which is also made in Detroit.

1050,"   By Allison Martell, Bernie Woodall and Alastair Sharp  Canada's main autoworkers' union on Tuesday named General Motors Co as its strike target in contract talks with three major automakers, saying GM was its biggest bargaining challenge given the union's demand for new investment in Ontario plants.Unifor National President Jerry Dias said he does not expect a strike, but added that the carmaker must shift its strategy and announce investment plans for Canada before any deal is ratified. The union had previously said investment, especially for GM's Oshawa assembly plant, was its top priority in talks.""Who do I perceive, and who do we perceive, as the biggest challenge? It's General Motors. So if we're going to have a dust-up, we might as well have it immediately,"" said Dias at a press conference in Toronto.Bargaining with the Canadian arms of GM, Ford Motor Co  and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles kicked off in August. The union typically selects one company for intensive negotiations. That company's deal sets a pattern, and other auto manufacturers are expected to agree to similar contracts. Dias set a strike deadline of Sept. 19, expiration date for four-year contracts covering about 3,900 workers at GM, 9,750 at Fiat Chrysler and 6,700 at Ford.""We continue to remain focused on finding a new agreement that is mutually beneficial and competitive,"" said David Paterson, GM Canada's vice president for corporate and environmental affairs.

That is partly because of beneficial factors that will not reoccur in the second part of the year and the expense of the rollout of Ford's highly profitable Super Duty large pickup trucks. Ford shares on Thursday closed at $12.73, up 0.2 percent.When it issued second-quarter financial results in late July, Ford said its 2016 adjusted pre-tax profit would be equal to or greater than last year’s $10.8 billion.Ford said the new expense will show in its third-quarter results and primarily in North America, its most profitable region which has been driving record company profits recently. The company has recalled nearly 4 million vehicles for door latch issues in six separate recalls since 2014.Ford said the latest expansion was at the request of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after the automaker in August issued a regional recall covering 830,000 vehicles.

1065,"   By Paul Lienert | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) Chief Executive Mark Fields is looking for more deals to advance the automaker's expansion into ride services and autonomous vehicles, but will not rush to match big spending by auto industry rivals, he told Reuters. Investors comparing the size of Ford's investments to what other automakers have announced are ""looking at the wrong scoreboard,"" Fields said in an interview at Ford headquarters on Tuesday, ahead of the company's annual late-summer investor meeting.""Don't confuse activity for progress,"" Fields said in response to questions about why Ford's future 'mobility' investments appear to lag those of competitors such as General Motors Co (GM.N), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).Mobility is the term auto companies and investors use to describe the next wave of personal transportation, which is still largely car-based but includes a wide range of services from ride sharing to automated driving and parking.Fields and other top Ford executives are scheduled to meet on Wednesday with investors and analysts to address concerns that the automaker is heading into a cyclical downturn in the United States market, which generates the bulk of Ford's profit.Fields is expected to highlight the prospects for Ford to jump-start growth over the next several years by developing new businesses using autonomous, or self-driving, vehicles and internet-enabled services such as shuttle vans that can be hailed using a smartphone app.A Reuters analysis of automaker investments in future mobility startups estimates that Ford has spent less than $500 million in the sector over the past five years, while Toyota has spent more than $1.1 billion, GM more than $1.2 billion and Daimler more than $1.4 billion. So far, the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker has announced a steady stream of relatively small deals. GM, in contrast, has highlighted bigger moves such as its $700 million acquisition of driving startup Cruise Automation and a $500 million investment in ride services company Lyft.GM has outlined plans to use its alliance with Lyft to place electric and autonomous vehicles in ride services fleets, while expanding car sharing through its Maven brand. FORD GOES SMALL   Ford has focused on smaller startups in such fields as laser sensors, mapping, artificial intelligence and data analytics. Last week, Ford said it had acquired Chariot, a San Francisco-based startup that provides a local on-demand shuttle service with dynamic routing capability.Fields said the company has a ""contingency fund"" to finance future investments that fit into Ford's long-range mobility strategy, but wants to ""make sure we are investing wisely"" in a field where less than half the prospects offer real value.  Fields said Ford will “leave all options open” for partnerships and acquisitions to expand its services business. ""It will take time to scale some of these new businesses,"" he said. Until then, Fields said those ventures will be funded in part by Ford's core business, including its high-volume, high-margin pickup trucks.	 Ford also will place ""a high priority on stable and sustainable dividends,"" Fields said. Ford's current dividend yield is nearly 4.7 percent.Ford shares are down 12 percent for the year to date,reflecting investors' concerns that vehicle sales in the United States are slowing down. ""Investors are so focused on when the next recession is coming and what happens to auto stocks in the recession, they’re not paying a huge amount of attention to whether GM’s strategy of spending big to position itself for the next era of mobility or Ford’s strategy of going late with less of a checkbook is the right one,"" Barclays Capital analyst Brian Johnson said on Tuesday.Ford jolted investors on July 28 when it released second-quarter results that fell short of Wall Street expectations, and Chief Financial Officer Robert Shanks said “the growth is over” in the U.S. market.

1070,"   By Paul Lienert | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) Chief Executive Mark Fields is looking for more deals to advance the automaker's expansion into ride services and autonomous vehicles, but will not rush to match big spending by auto industry rivals, he told Reuters. Investors comparing the size of Ford's investments to what other automakers have announced are ""looking at the wrong scoreboard,"" Fields said in an interview at Ford headquarters on Tuesday, ahead of the company's annual late-summer investor meeting.""Don't confuse activity for progress,"" Fields said in response to questions about why Ford's future 'mobility' investments appear to lag those of competitors such as General Motors Co (GM.N), Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).Mobility is the term auto companies and investors use to describe the next wave of personal transportation, which is still largely car-based but includes a wide range of services from ride sharing to automated driving and parking.Fields and other top Ford executives are scheduled to meet on Wednesday with investors and analysts to address concerns that the automaker is heading into a cyclical downturn in the United States market, which generates the bulk of Ford's profit.Fields is expected to highlight the prospects for Ford to jump-start growth over the next several years by developing new businesses using autonomous, or self-driving, vehicles and internet-enabled services such as shuttle vans that can be hailed using a smartphone app.A Reuters analysis of automaker investments in future mobility startups estimates that Ford has spent less than $500 million in the sector over the past five years, while Toyota has spent more than $1.1 billion, GM more than $1.2 billion and Daimler more than $1.4 billion. So far, the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker has announced a steady stream of relatively small deals. GM, in contrast, has highlighted bigger moves such as its $700 million acquisition of driving startup Cruise Automation and a $500 million investment in ride services company Lyft.GM has outlined plans to use its alliance with Lyft to place electric and autonomous vehicles in ride services fleets, while expanding car sharing through its Maven brand.

1071,"   By Bernie Woodall and David Shepardson  Ford Motor Co Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said on Wednesday that all of the company's small-car production would be leaving U.S. plants and heading to lower-cost Mexico, drawing another rebuke from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.""We will have migrated all of our small-car production to Mexico and out of the United States,"" over the next two to three years, Fields told Wall Street analysts at an investor conference hosted by the automaker.Trump, campaigning in Flint, Michigan, on Wednesday, called Ford's decision ""horrible."" He has criticized Ford's Mexican investments for more than a year and vowed to pressure the automaker to reverse course if elected.""We shouldn't allow it to happen,"" Trump said.Fields has previously responded to Trump's criticism by saying that as a global company Ford must compete by making solid business decisions. Earlier this year, Ford said it would invest $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018.During contract talks in 2015, Ford confirmed that it would move Focus and C-Max production out of its Wayne, Michigan, plant in 2018. The United Auto Workers Union said at the time that Ford planned to build the next Focus in Mexico.A source briefed on the matter said the shift of production to Mexico was expected to take place next year before the start of the 2018 model year. In April, Ford reiterated that it was planning to build two new vehicles at the Wayne plant beginning in 2018. Analysts have said they expect Ford to build a new Bronco SUV and Ranger pickup there.Fields said that Ford planned to shift a majority of its small car production around the world to low-cost countries by 2019, which could affect Ford's Western European car production.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said in April that it would realign North American plants to emphasize truck and Jeep production over car output. The changes are expected to be completed by early 2018. Both automakers are making the moves because U.S. consumers have turned away from traditional sedans and hatchbacks to SUVs and pickup trucks. The United Auto Workers has said the number of auto assembly jobs would not decline because workers would be busy making SUVs and pickup trucks.However, UAW President Dennis Williams has said there was a risk that if gasoline prices rose again above $4 per gallon as in mid-2008, consumers might once again favor smaller cars.

1072,"  SAN FRANCISCO China-based internet company Baidu has received a permit to test its self-driving cars in California from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles, as the race to introduce driverless automobiles accelerates.Baidu, which unveiled its autonomous vehicle in China last December and has been steadily increasing its investments and partnerships in the sector, has already tested on Chinese roads and highways. California is seen as a crucial testing ground for autonomous vehicles due to technological innovations being developed in Silicon Valley, where many car companies and start-ups operate research labs to develop self-driving technology. Baidu said it would begin testing in California ""very soon."" ""Being able to do road tests will greatly accelerate our progress,"" Jing Wang, general manager of Baidu's autonomous driving unit, said in a statement.     In April, Baidu opened an office in Silicon Valley and said it plans to have over 100 researchers and engineers working there by year's end. With its California DMV permit, Baidu becomes the 15th company to receive approval from the state. Others with the permit include traditional automakers such as Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Ford Motor Co, as well as technology firms including Alphabet's Google, and Chinese electric vehicle start-up Faraday Future. In August, both Baidu and Ford jointly invested $150 million in Velodyne, a Silicon Valley maker of laser-based sensors that are a key building block for self-driving cars.A flurry of well-funded Chinese tech firms, including Alibaba, have poured money and resources into the automotive sector, with many launching new electric car start-ups, some of them based in California. Faraday Future was awarded approval to test its cars in California in June.

1073,"   By Bernie Woodall and David Shepardson  Ford Motor Co's 2017 financial performance will decline from this year as it increases spending on ""emerging opportunities"" like self-driving cars and other costs rise, the No. 2 U.S.-based automaker said on Wednesday.Ford, like most of its chief rivals, is seeking ways to profit as the industry moves toward self-driving vehicles and ride-sharing. The company is taking a cautious path on this course, its chief executive, Mark Fields, indicated in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday.Ford stock fell 1.9 percent to close at $12.14.Also, Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said all of the company's small-car production will be leaving U.S. plants and heading to lower-cost Mexico over the next two to three years.Last week, Ford lowered its 2016 pretax profit forecast to $10.2 billion from at least $10.8 billion because of a charge in the third quarter for an expanded vehicle recall.Ford said it ""plans to achieve cost efficiencies averaging $3 billion annually between 2016 and 2018 and is adding new processes like zero-base budgeting to further its business transformation."" This will ""offset the vast majority of costs being added to strengthen Ford’s business,"" but will not be enough to offset higher regulatory and vehicle development costs for what it calls emerging opportunities, such as electric vehicles.Ford disclosed its outlook ahead of presentations later in the day to Wall Street analysts at its headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan.It will incur regulatory costs largely linked to tougher fuel economy and vehicle emissions standards as well as safety requirements worldwide, Ford Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told analysts. Shanks also said one of the ""substantial headwinds"" for the 2017 outlook is higher commodity costs in North America, where Ford derived about 90 percent of its second-quarter profit. Shanks said Ford will pay a supplemental dividend of 40 percent to 50 percent of 2016 net income, as it did in March this year, if it reaches some financial targets and if no recession is seen on the horizon.The automaker said automotive capital expenditures will rise to 5.6 percent of automotive revenue in 2018, from 4.9 percent in 2016. It will decline after 2018, Ford said.Most of the capital allocation will be for vehicle development and be returned to shareholders. Ford said it will be able to maintain cash from automotive operations at or above $10 billion in a downturn and continue to pay regular dividends. In July, Shanks said the automotive sales boom in the United States since the 2008-2009 downturn was over, but that sales would not crater as they did during the last recession.But if they do, Ford could break even if industry sales in North America fell to 11 million vehicles in 2017 and if they were at least 11 million in 2018.Ford's costs for layoffs would be about $500 million in 2017, one-fifth of what it cost in 2007, to compensate idled workers if U.S. sales were hypothetically to decline by 40 percent.Ford shares were down 25 cents at $12.13 on Wednesday afternoon. The stock has not recovered since it fell more than 8 percent in late July when it said the industry was going into a gradual decline.

1081,"   By Paul Lienert and Alexandria Sage | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Some Ford (F.N) owners will soon be able to turn up the heat at home from their cars using Amazon’s (AMZN.O) Alexa voice service or start their vehicles from their desks using the same system.Ford Motor Co said that three models, the Focus Electric, Fusion Energi and C-Max Energi, by year's end will be able to communicate with smart home devices using Alexa by pressing a voice recognition button on the steering wheel.Consumers can send instructions to their Ford vehicles from home by using Amazon’s Echo smart home device and Alexa, an “intelligent assistant,” similar to Apple’s Siri, that enables users to access Internet services and interact with devices using voice commands. Vehicle owners also will be able to send simple commands via Alexa to smart home appliances and systems. The Ford-Amazon partnership was announced at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in January. Production plans were shared last week with Reuters during a demonstration of the service at Ford’s Research and Innovation Center in Palo Alto, California. A Ford spokesperson said the service has entered a final phase of testing with Amazon before its planned release at the end of the year.Among the functions that Alexa can provide are the ability to preset temperature in the home, check the security system or turn on the outside lights from the car. Using an Echo device in the home or office, Alexa users can start the vehicle, lock or unlock their doors and check the range between charges, after providing a security code. Alexa also can be used to update shopping lists, get weather reports, check appointments and cue up music in the car.Some of the in-vehicle services through Alexa will be rolled out to other Ford models starting early next year, according to Ford spokesman Alan Hall. Carmakers are increasingly trying to improve the customer experience inside cars with features to rival the convenience of smartphones. The growing focus on network-connected appliances and other home devices — part of the so-called ""Internet of Things"" phenomenon — has inspired collaborations between automakers and technical service providers such as the Ford-Amazon alliance.

1084,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) said on Wednesday new 2017 models of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck will improve fuel efficiency by 11 percent for four-wheel drive versions which use a 10-speed transmission jointly developed with rival General Motors Co (GM.N).The best-selling vehicle in North America since the mid-1970s, the F-150 four-wheel drive versions with 3.5-liter ""EcoBoost"" turbo-charged engines will achieve an average 20 miles per gallon, up from 18 mpg from current versions.F-150 fuel economy ratings compare favorably, albeit only slightly better, than V8 gasoline pickup trucks the company targets by rivals GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI). But Ford probably will not widen its sales lead on this factor alone, one analyst said. ""This engine is going in a truck that for the most part will eclipse $40,000 and with gas in the $2 to $2.50 range, 1 or 2 miles per gallon more is not going to be winning over many new buyers,"" said Dave Sullivan, automotive analyst with AutoPacific Inc. The ratings are for combined highway and city driving. The 2017 F-150 models go on sale by the end of this year.Ford executives have warned investors that with gasoline prices low, consumers may not pay the full cost of technology used to meet stiffer fuel efficiency mandates.When Ford and GM announced their cooperation to develop 10-speed transmissions in 2013, U.S. gasoline prices had averaged at least $3.50 per gallon for three straight years. And both companies were recovering from the 2008-2009 financial crisis and sought to save on expensive vehicle development costs. But gas prices have trended downward since, and were $2.23 per gallon on Wednesday, according to AAA.The costs are great to gain just a single mile per gallon for a model. The company will gain more flexibility on its model lineup as it strives to meet U.S. mandates, even with a small gain in fuel efficiency of the F-150 because of its sales volume. In addition to the costs to develop the new technology, Ford invested $1.4 billion for a production line at its transmission plant in Livonia, Michigan for the 10-speeds that will go into the new trucks.Of the new 3.5-liter ""EcoBoost"" trucks with a 10-speed transmission, 80 percent will be four-wheel drive. Together with two-wheel drive versions, trucks with the 10-speed transmissions will account for about 30 percent of F-150 sales, Ford said.

1091,"  (Adds further comment from union, Fiat Chrysler)By Matt ScuffhamTORONTO Oct 11 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  reached a tentative deal with unionized workers in Canada by agreeing to make more than C$400 million ($301 million) in investments in local operations, the union said late on Monday.The deal was announced just minutes ahead of a midnight strike deadline that could have sent more than 9,000 workers off the job.""This has been one very difficult set of negotiations,"" said Jerry Dias, national president of the union, Unifor.Union members will vote on the deal at ratification meetings on October 16. A strike is still possible if workers vote against the deal. A strike by Canadian workers would have disrupted production of minivans built in Windsor, Ontario, including the new Chrysler Pacifica, as well as sedans assembled in Brampton, Ontario northwest of Toronto.As part of the deal, Fiat Chrysler has agreed to invest C$325 million in a new paint shop at the Brampton facility, the union said. The company will provide additional funding taking its investment under the agreement to more than C$400 million, Dias said.The company confirmed it reached a tentative agreement with Unifor, but said because it is subject to member ratification it could not discuss the specifics. Unifor represents Canadian manufacturing workers at Fiat Chrysler, Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co. It uses a pattern bargaining strategy to negotiate with the three automakers, selecting one company to hold talks with and then holding the other two to the broad terms of that deal.It reached a pattern deal with GM last month, including new investment that is expected to save thousands of jobs at the company's Oshawa, Ontario plant.Dias said the union will move on to the Ford negotiations in one week if ratification takes place as planned. The strike deadline for Ford is the end of month. Unifor had said ahead of contract talks that its top priority would be securing new investment in Canada, including an overhaul of the Brampton paint shop.The Brampton plant builds large sedans, including the Chrysler 300, Dodge Challenger and Dodge Charger, employing about 3,300 unionized workers.With some 6,000 unionized workers, the Windsor van plant produces all of Fiat Chrysler's minivans for the North American market, including the new Chrysler Pacifica, the Chrysler Town and Country and the Dodge Caravan.The contract also covers about 450 workers that make parts in Toronto's west end.($1 = 1.3290 Canadian dollars)   (With additional reporting by Jeffrey Hodgson; Editing by Vyas Mohan and Stephen Coates)",2016-10-11,F,"Tue Oct 11, 2016 | 1:09am EDT","UPDATE 2-Canada union says reaches deal with Fiat Chrysler, strike averted",http://www.reuters.com//article/canada-autos-idUSL1N1CH04Q?type=companyNews

1093,"   By Bernie Woodall | DETROIT  DETROIT In a fresh sign of pressure on U.S. automakers, Ford Motor Co on Monday said it will shut down production of its best-selling F-150 pickup truck for a week at a Kansas City assembly plant, and temporarily idle three other plants over the next several weeks.About 13,000 Ford hourly workers will be laid off during the temporary shutdowns. There are nearly 14,000 workers at the four plants, the company said. Some of them are salaried managers. Of the layoffs, about 4,000 will be in Mexico and about 9,000 in the United States. The cuts will hit Ford's three highest-volume models in the United States.The F-150 is the best-selling vehicle model in North America, where Ford in the second quarter derived 90 percent of its profit, and the F-150 is a key profit-maker for Ford. However, sales of the overall F-series pickup model line fell nearly 3 per cent in September. Ford dealers had a heavy 95 days' supply of the pickups on their lots at the end of September, according to data compiled by Automotive News. F-150 production at the Dearborn Truck Plant in Michigan will continue without interruption, Ford said. Ford is also suspending production of two sport utility vehicles, the Ford Escape and the Lincoln MKC, at its Louisville Assembly Plant for two of the next three weeks. The compact Escape, the company's second best-selling U.S. model, is under increasing pressure from Japanese rivals. Escape U.S. sales were down 12 percent in September. Ford said it also is shutting two plants in Mexico. One is a plant in Hermosillo that makes the Ford Fusion and the Lincoln MKZ sedans, and the other is in Cuautitlan that makes the Ford Fiesta small car. Fusion is the No. 3 seller in Ford's U.S. lineup, but suffered a 17.5 percent drop in sales last month.  ""During our second quarter financial call, we said we expected the overall retail industry to decline in the second half of the year from the same period last year.

The U.S. workers with more than one year of experience will get about 80 percent of their normal paycheck during the shutdowns, combining state unemployment benefits and Ford supplemental pay, Ford said.

1098,"  LONDON Jaguar Land Rover, Ford (F.N) and Tata Motors (TAMO.NS) are testing connected cars which can communicate with each other using technology designed to speed up journeys and cut accidents, the first such trials in Britain.Cars which are able to warn drivers when another connected vehicle brakes suddenly and those which can monitor traffic signals and regulate their speed to encounter fewer red lights were being showcased at a testing ground in central England.Increasingly sophisticated technology in vehicles is paving the way for fully driverless vehicles, with Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), owned by India's Tata Motors, also demonstrating a self-driving Range Rover Sport which can automatically overtake slower moving cars. ""The benefits of having cars that can communicate with each other and their surroundings could be very significant -- from increased road safety to improved traffic flow,"" said Tim Armitage, a project director at government-backed UK Autodrive which coordinated the trials. Earlier this month, a driverless car was trialled on Britain's streets for the first time as part of government efforts to create an industry which can serve a worldwide market which it estimates to be worth up to 900 million pounds ($1.1 billion) by 2025. Britain is aiming to have driverless cars on its roads by the end of the decade.  Automakers are racing to head off the challenge from technology firms such as Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google, which is developing autonomous vehicles.

1100,"   By Bernie Woodall and Joseph White | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) and General Motors Co (GM.N) have worked all year to convince investors that they are no longer prisoners of the U.S. auto market cycle and have solid plans to fend off challenges from Silicon Valley interlopers. This week, Wall Street looked at the Detroit companies' stronger-than-expected quarterly results and turned thumbs down. GM, the largest U.S. automaker, reported record third-quarter net income on Tuesday, but its shares have fallen nearly 5 percent since then. Ford shares sank more than 1 percent on Thursday, bringing their year-to-date decline to about 17 percent, or about $7 billion of the company's market capitalization. (For graphic on Ford and GM earnings click tmsnrt.rs/1Nxqa9k)       The selloffs put more pressure on GM and Ford's chief executive officers to accelerate cost-cutting and buy back more shares. They must also make tough decisions between slashing production to prop up prices, or gunning for market share at the risk of reducing profit margins, analysts said.Highlighting Detroit's problems with investors was the market's response to Tesla Motors Inc's (TSLA.O) results. Late on Wednesday, the electric luxury car maker headed by billionaire Elon Musk announced its first profitable quarter in three years, with net income of $22 million. By comparison, GM reported net income of about $2.8 billion and Ford, nearly $1 billion.  Shares of Tesla were up 4 percent in afternoon trading on Thursday, boosting the company's market value to more than $30 billion.Wall Street has penalized GM and Ford shares this year because investors are convinced that a cyclical downturn is nigh for U.S. auto sales, which hit a record of about 17.5 million vehicles last year.Ford said in July that the six-year auto boom since the economic crisis was over and that sales would erode from their 2015 peak while still plateauing at historically lofty levels.Investors will watch as Ford and GM pursue contrary strategies for the fourth quarter in North America, where they generate nearly all of their profits. GM said on Tuesday that it bulked up inventories at U.S. dealers by more than 110,000 vehicles during the third quarter, and executives said they anticipated strong demand to continue. Ford, however, plans to cut fourth-quarter production in North America by 12.5 percent from a year earlier to keep dealers' lots from overflowing and avoid profit-sapping discounts.The company is idling one shift next week at a Kansas City, Missouri, plant that makes the F-150 pickup, its best-selling vehicle and one of its most profitable models. The company disclosed on Thursday that it was also closing a plant in Wayne, Michigan, for an extra two weeks before the end of the year to adjust production to demand. That plant makes the light-selling Focus compact car. Ford's results reflect Detroit's challenges. Third-quarter net income fell by more than 50 percent because of declining sales in North America, higher recall costs and a costly and complicated introduction of a new pickup.Still, the company backed its full-year earnings outlook and said it expected to generate cash this quarter after burning through $2 billion in the third quarter. CEO Mark Fields urged investors on Thursday to value Ford based on its efforts to break into new markets such as ride sharing and autonomous vehicles that promise higher profit margins. However, GM's $1.2 billion and Ford's $500 million of publicly disclosed investments in these businesses are dwarfed by the $16 billion ride services leader Uber Technologies Inc {UBER.UL} has raised in debt and equity, according to a Reuters analysis.

The automaker said it still expected full-year earnings of $10.2 billion and a return to positive cash flow after burning through $2 billion in the third quarter.Net income dropped to $961 million, or 24 cents a share, from $2.2 billion, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier.Excluding one-time items, Ford said earnings were 26 cents a share, beating the analysts' average estimate of 20 cents compiled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Third quarter revenue was $35.9 billion, down 6 percent, and North American operations revenue was $21.8 billion, down 8 percent. Ford had signaled most of the major numbers at a September investors presentation, and the results released on Thursday were little changed. The company's shares were down about 1.4 percent at $11.76 in afternoon trading.Ford's pretax operating margins were down by about half at 5.8 percent in North America and 3.3 percent worldwide.“What’s happening to the company is what’s happening in North America,” Chief Financial Officer Bob Shanks told reporters on Thursday.  Shanks said three factors accounted for a $1.6 billion decline in Ford’s North American pretax profit: costs of ramping up the new Super Duty pickup truck, which has an average price of about $62,000; a door-latch recall charge of $600 million recall; and lower profits from the company’s F-150 pickup truck. Ford is cutting production of the F-150 in the fourth quarter and, in a new action, will idle one shift for a week at a plant in Kansas City, Missouri, to reduce inventories of the truck, Shanks said. The F-150 is Ford’s best-selling vehicle and one of its most profitable models. The company said pretax profit in Europe jumped to $138 million from $9 million. However, Shanks said the falling value of the British pound would cost Ford $140 million in the second half of 2015 and $600 million next year. Ford is 80 percent hedged against the currency for 2017, he said.Income from Ford's Chinese joint ventures rose 26 percent to $320 million. ""China is very, very strong,"" Shanks said.

1108,"  STOCKHOLM Oct 27 Geely-owned Volvo Car Group reported a 62 percent rise in third quarter earnings on Thursday, driven by strong demand for new pricier models that have lifted both sales and profitability, and raised its profit outlook for the full year.Volvo, acquired by China's Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. from Ford Motor Co. F.N in 2010, said operating earnings rose to 2.07 billion Swedish crowns ($232.5 million) in the quarter from 1.28 billion a year ago.Gothenburg-based Volvo, one of Sweden's biggest companies by sales and staff numbers, said it now expected a ""substantial improvement"" in profits for full year 2016 compared with a previous outlook for an ""improvement"" over last year. Volvo, whose sales rose to 41.1 billion crowns from a year-ago 36.1 billion, is banking on a vast investment plan in new models and plants to carve out a firm foothold in a premium market where it struggled to make its mark under Ford ownership. ""With nine months of the year completed, I can state with confidence that Volvo Cars is on track for another record year in terms of sales,"" Volvo Cars Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson said in a statement. Volvo, whose sales reached the half million mark last year as it looks to a goal of selling 800,000 cars in the medium term, said strong demand for its XC90 SUV, the first new model developed under Geely ownership, helped drive revenues.The auto maker said its operating margin was 5 percent in the quarter, a decline from the 6.7 percent reported in the first half as launch costs for its new S90 and V90 models weighed, but still higher that the year-ago 3.5 percent.

But after a strong first half, sales have declined in September and August on an annual basis. General Motors said in a statement it delivered 22,219 vehicles in October, down 9 percent compared with the same month in 2015, which had two more selling days. Year-to-date, GM's Canadian sales are up 1 percent compared with the first 10 months of 2015.FCA reported October sales in Canada of 19,527 vehicles, down 11 percent from 22,031 units during the same month in 2015, hurt in part by weaker demand for its Ram pickup trucks, the company said in a statement. Year-to-date, the automaker reported sales of 239,185 vehicles, down 4 percent compared with 248,522 units during the same period last year. However, Honda Motor Co Ltd said its Canadian sales rose 2 percent in October to 17,270 vehicles.In the United States, Fiat Chrysler sales slid 10 percent, including a rare decrease for its Jeep SUV brand, which saw a 7 percent decline.GM's October sales fell a less-than-forecast 1.7 percent as hefty gains for pickups and SUVs offset declines for its sedans.

1119,"  (In headline and first paragraph, corrects GM total sales down 1.7 percent, not 6.2 percent)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT Nov 1 General Motors Co's sales in October fell 1.7 percent from a year ago as its midsize sedans posted huge declines, partly offset by hefty gains for its smaller pickup trucks and large SUVs, the automaker said on Tuesday.GM, the top seller of automobiles in the U.S. market, was the first major manufacturer to show October sales on Tuesday.U.S. auto sales in October were expected to decline between 6 percent and 8 percent, according to industry analysts who say the fall-off from last year's record high is not being limited by higher consumer discounts.The rate of decline in October from a year ago will not be known until later this week because Ford Motor Co is delaying its sales report due to a fire at its Dearborn, Michigan headquarters on Monday. GM said U.S. industry auto sales will be 17.4 million on a seasonally adjusted annualized rate.GM's two full-size pickup truck models, Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra, collectively fell 7.6 percent. Thirty-nine economists polled by Thomson Reuters expected sales of 17.5 million vehicles on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis. Wall Street automotive analysts polled by Reuters expected annualized sales of about 17.7 million vehicles.Ford, the second biggest automaker in the U.S. market with a 15 percent share of sales through September, has not said when it will issue its sales report. The 60-year-old headquarters, which houses 1,500 employees, was reopened for business on Tuesday after workers were sent home on Monday.Analysts expect Ford to show a decline of between 9 percent and 11 percent from a year ago, which some analysts said was due to better discipline on the use of discounts. Others pointed out that the company is stemming production at North American F-150 pickup truck plants and sedan plants because of weak demand. Comparisons to last October are pressured because of two fewer selling days. But even with that factored in, sales would likely have been weaker if not for the big consumer discounts, known as incentives, analysts said.TrueCar Inc said October incentives industrywide rose nearly 16 percent from a year earlier, or about $3,600 per new vehicle sold.Sales at Toyota, No. 3 in the U.S. market, is expected to  decline of between 2 percent and 7 percent, according to analysts polled by Reuters.Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  is seen falling from last October between 7.5 percent and 11 percent.

1124,"   By Norihiko Shirouzu | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI Swedish car maker Volvo announced on Wednesday moves deepening cooperation with its Chinese parent Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co - a tie-up that's shaping up to show that China can make a success of buying consumer brands.Volvo's global chief executive Hakan Samuelsson and Geely Chairman Li Shufu said the two firms will soon start producing cars at a joint assembly plant in Taizhou, in eastern Zhejiang province.The plant, operated by Volvo and expected to start gradually ramping up production this quarter, will produce compact cars based on an ""advanced"" vehicle architecture the two companies have jointly developed in Sweden. Both Volvo and Geely are expected to produce small cars at the plant based on that Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) platform - for both domestic and export markets.Volvo is trying to create ""synergies and economies of scale"", Samuelsson said in Shanghai on Wednesday, ""by sharing development-intensive components: engines, transmissions, suspension parts and brakes"", and by sharing manufacturing facilities. The effort won't ""dilute"" or ""jeopardize"" the identities of the two car brands, he said.On Wednesday, Volvo also unveiled two stretched variants of its recently launched large S90 premium sedan, including the S90 Excellence. It will build both S90 variants at its assembly plant in Daqing in northeastern China, for sale in China and abroad.Samuelsson and other Volvo officials said Volvo will make China a global production hub for the S90 and its long-wheel base variants. While some production of those cars will likely remain in Europe the company over time will produce in China a majority of those cars it sells globally.Volvo began exporting its China-made cars last year, shipping its S60 Inscription to the United States.The Taizhou plant will be Volvo's third assembly site in China, along with Daqing and one in Chengdu in western China. The car maker also has two plants in Europe, and is building a new plant in South Carolina in the United States. RISING SALES Geely raised auto industry eyebrows when it bought Volvo from Ford (F.N) for $1.8 billion six years ago. Few saw any obvious synergies in marrying a premium Western marquee with a Chinese entry brand.But the two appear to be making it work. Cooperating on buying parts, developing technologies and boosting capacity, sales of both brands have risen. Volvo increased its third-quarter sales in both China and the United States by more than a fifth, and July-September operating profit jumped 62 percent to 2.07 billion Swedish crowns ($232.5 million).Geely sold more than half a million cars last year, up 22 percent, and sales in the first nine months of this year were already at nearly 460,000 cars.""Moving production from Sweden to China, and sharing manufacturing processes and components has been a positive for both Geely and Volvo from a cost savings perspective,"" said James Chao, Asia-Pacific chief for consulting and research firm IHS Markit Automotive. ""It makes sense especially as they upgrade the Geely product line-up with the new Lynk brand, as well as through tangible product improvements, which should help protect the Volvo brand from association with a lower cost brand."" Geely said this month it will use the jointly developed compact car CMA platform for a new brand called Lynk & Co, which will begin production next year for the Chinese market and start exporting to Europe and the United States in 2018.PREMIUM IMAGE Chao at IHS said that despite the signs of progress in the partnership, the process of integrating Volvo has been slower than he expected. ""So far, I'd grade it a 'B',"" he said.Geely insiders acknowledge that Volvo wants to keep some distance between the two brands, fearing that too close a manufacturing tie-up could risk diluting its premium image.And, the insiders note, there is still some disconnect as to just how premium Volvo's premium cars should be for the Chinese market, with Geely Chairman Li said to want a more upscale model to compete with BMW (BMWG.DE), Audi (NSUG.DE), Mercedes-Benz (DAIGn.DE).A Volvo spokesman said there is no disagreement on the need for a large premium sedan for Volvo. ""The S90 large sedan is an area we need to move into in order to be credible in the premium sector,"" the spokesman said.

1125,"   By Ankit Ajmera  American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc (AXL.N) has agreed to buy Metaldyne Performance Group Inc (MPG.N) for about $1.6 billion, the companies said on Thursday, in a cash-and-stock deal that would lower the U.S. auto parts maker's dependence on General Motors Co (GM.N).Shares of Detroit-based American Axle, which was spun off from GM in 1994, fell 17.6 percent to close at $13.68. Southfield, Michigan-based Metaldyne's shares rose 34.3 percent to $19.20.Under the terms of the deal, Metaldyne shareholders will get $13.50 in cash and half of an American Axle share, or a total of $21.81 per share, a premium of 52.5 percent to Metaldyne's Wednesday's close.The deal, American Axle's biggest ever, will include the assumption of $1.7 billion of Metaldyne's debt, the companies said.Ford Motor Co (F.N) was Metaldyne's biggest purchaser of auto parts, accounting for almost a quarter of its 2015 sales. The deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2017, would help American Axle grow beyond GM, which accounted for two-thirds of its 2015 sales and make Ford one of its major customers.         Metaldyne and American Axle make complementary products, including components for use in powertrain and drivetrain applications for vehicles, that transfer power from the transmission to the wheels.The deal came as U.S. motor vehicles sales hit a plateau after reaching a record in 2015, which also marked the peak of a recovery from the 2008-2009 economic crisis. Automakers have said pent-up demand from the recession has been satisfied.The combined company will have annual sales of nearly $7 billion, on a pro-forma basis, behind Borgwarner Inc's (BWA.N) 2015 sales of about $8 billion and Canada-based Magna International Inc's (MG.TO) 2015 annual sales of about $32 billion.American Axle shareholders will own about 70 percent of the combined company, and Metaldyne shareholders will own the remaining, the companies said. Private-equity firm American Securities LLC, the controlling stockholder of Metaldyne, will own 23 percent of the new company and appoint three of its directors, expanding the size of the board to 11.The deal is expected to save American Axle $100 million to $120 million by 2018.Greenhill & Co LLC and J.P. Morgan advised American Axle on the deal, while BofA Merrill Lynch advised Metaldyne.

1126,"   By Susan Taylor and Allison Lampert | TORONTO/MONTREAL  TORONTO/MONTREAL Nov 4 Ford Motor Co will invest some C$600 million ($447 million) in its two Windsor, Ontario, engine plants to update existing V8 production and add assembly of a new fuel-efficient motor for large pickup trucks, two sources familiar with the matter said.The investment is part of a tentative labor agreement with Ford's 7,000 Canadian auto workers, who vote on Saturday and Sunday on the four-year contract. The union, Unifor, has said Ford will spend approximately C$700 million under the deal.Hefty spending on engine production was seen as vital because the large V8 and V10 motors now built at Ford's Windsor Engine plant were expected to end production in four years.""There was nothing planned for Windsor after 2020,"" said Joe McCabe, AutoForecast Solutions Chief Executive. ""They need it (the new engine) to survive."" Ford of Canada spokeswoman Kerri Stoakley and Unifor spokeswoman Denise Hammond said they would not comment before members have reviewed and voted on the deal.A portion of the C$600 million will be used to update existing 5.0-liter V8 engine production at the Essex Engine plant, according to the two sources, who declined to be identified because the plan is not yet public. The updated engine is expected to be a 4.8-liter V8 for the F-150 pickup truck. The remainder of the C$600 million will go toward production of a new fuel-efficient large engine, not yet named by Ford, for such ""super-duty trucks"" as the F-250, one of the sources said.Unifor said that Essex would get a major new engine program, when it announced the deal, and Windsor would continue producing 6.8-liter engines through the new contract period. In addition to engine investment, Ford will spend C$100 million for a ""refresh,"" or updated version, of the Ford Edge SUV and Lincoln MKX and MKT models assembled in Oakville, the two sources said.Under the agreement, Ford agreed that Oakville will be the only North American supplier of those vehicles, said a third source, who asked not to be named. Unifor said Tuesday that Ford also designated Oakville as a primary supplier of those models for international export.That puts Oakville in a good position to win next-generation production of those models, representing an investment of about C$1 billion, the source said.Ford is the last of three automakers to negotiate with Unifor after deals with General Motors and Fiat Chrysler .

1127,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) BARCELONA/LONDON, November 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlook on  Renault SA to Positive from Stable and affirmed its Long-Term Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings at 'BBB-'. The rating action reflects our view that the group is firmly on track to meet  Fitch's current positive rating guidelines at end-2016. We believe that  sustained profitability and cash generation have been achieved through both  favourable and adverse conditions, providing comfort that earning generation has  not been driven only by the successful product line and the recovery in new  vehicle sales in Europe but also by the streamlined cost structure and synergies  created with partners. Any positive rating action will be dependent on the  sustainability of the positive trend in the next 12-18 months. KEY RATING DRIVERS Resilient Earnings and Cash Flow: The ratings reflect Renault SA's resilient  profitability and cash generation in a difficult environment in certain regions,  especially for volume manufacturers. Group operating margins have continuously  increased since 2012 to 5.1% in 2015, and Fitch Ratings expects them to remain  above 5% between 2016 and 2018, including a strengthening of core automotive  operations, and despite the consolidation of loss making Avtovaz. Renault's restructuring measures have streamlined its cost structure, lowered  its breakeven point and made it more resistant to a possible downturn and  potential future financial challenges. In particular, we expect conditions to  remain difficult in some emerging markets in 2017, although this should be  offset by the improving environment in Europe. Strong Credit Metrics: Net financial debt has fallen substantially since 2009 as  a result of positive free cash flow (FCF) and asset sales, while earnings and  funds from operations (FFO) rebounded in the same period. Net FFO adjusted  leverage has declined continuously since end-2009, from 5.6x, to 0.2x at  end-2015, providing the group with more flexibility to go through the sector's  next cyclical downturn. We expect consistently positive FCF above EUR1bn per  annum in the next two to three years to further reduce net leverage. Weak but Improving Mix: Renault's sales retain a bias towards Europe, despite  recent diversification outside this region. The group also derives the majority  of its revenue from the less profitable mass-market small- and medium-sized car  segments, where competition is fiercest and price pressure is strongest. Successful Entry-Level Models: The success of the growing entry range is pivotal  in compensating for the sales decline of the core Renault models, and also  favours geographical diversification. In addition, the profitability of the  entry range is higher than the automotive average and therefore bolsters group  operating profit. Recent Renault-branded models have also been received  positively and are supporting market shares and sales. Avtovaz Recapitalisation: Renault's participation in Avtovaz's recapitalisation  and debt restructuring will make it the majority shareholder and will lead to  Avtovaz's full consolidation in Renault's accounts. We believe that the cash  impact is limited for Renault in view of its comfortable liquidity and solid FCF  and view the moderate dilutive effect on Renault's reported operating profit  from the consolidation of Avtovaz's weak earnings as only an accounting  treatment with no major credit impact. DERIVATION SUMMARY From a peer comparison perspective, we believe that Renault compares well with  global automotive manufacturers at the 'BBB' level. On a standalone basis,  Renault is arguably smaller than General Motors Company (GM, BBB-/Positive),  Ford Motor Company (BBB) and Hyundai Motors Corporation (BBB+) and about the  same size as Kia Motor Company (BBB+, aligned with Hyundai, but assessed as  'BBB' on a standalone basis). However, Renault benefits from the alliance with  Nissan to gain economies of scale and develop synergies.  Renault's other relative weakness compared to its US peers is weaker brand  positioning. However, we believe Renault's relative position should be assessed  when incorporating both Dacia and Renault, the former not having a high brand  value and leading market shares, but enhancing product and geographic  diversification as well as healthily contributing to profitability. Compared  with Hyundai and Kia, we see a much closer comparison in terms of competitive  position and brand positioning. From a financial standpoint, Renault's operating margin is lower than Ford's,  GM's and Hyundai's, but in line with Kia's. FCF margin and net leverage are  broadly similar to Ford's, GM's and Kia's, around 2%-3% and slightly negative,  respectively. GM's CFO to debt ratio is somewhat stronger above 100% but  Renault's compares adequately with Ford's and Kia's. No Country Ceiling, parent/subsidiary or operating environment aspects affect  the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Renault include: - industrial operations revenue up by 12% in 2016, and increasing further by the  mid-single digits in 2017-2018; - auto operating margin (ex Avtovaz) increasing to 4.7% in 2016 and remaining  between 4.2%-4.5% in 2017-2018; - capex to increase moderately, at 6.5-6.8% of sales; - dividend payment to increase gradually from EUR700m to 800m by 2018. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include:  - Sustainable improvement in financial metrics, including  - net adjusted leverage below 0.5x - CFO on total adjusted debt above 50% - Sustainable improvement in profitability - in particular, group operating margin above 5% and  - auto operating margin above 4% -Further diversification outside Europe -Successful and profitable introduction of a premium model range Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: - Deteriorating profitability - including auto operating margin remaining below 1.5% and  - group operating margin below 3% - FCF margin below 1% - Deterioration of key credit metrics, including - net adjusted leverage above 1.5x - CFO/adjusted debt below 35% LIQUIDITY Healthy Liquidity: Liquidity is ample, including EUR11.2bn of readily available  cash and liquid investments for industrial operations at end-2015, according to  Fitch's adjustments for minimum operational cash of about EUR1.4bn and not  readily available financial assets.

However, due to  an undercapitalisation of the group's financial services business under Fitch's  methodology, we adjust the debt of the industrial operations by EUR0.8bn in  order to reduce financial services debt to equity to 7x from the reported 8.9x  at end-2015. Fitch also adjusts cash balances for minimum operational cash requirements of  about EUR1.4bn, adds an 8x multiple of operating leases to debt, totalling  EUR1.8bn, and adds EUR0.8bn to debt with respect to derecognised trade  receivables.

1128,"   By David Shepardson and Naomi Tajitsu | WASHINGTON/TOKYO  WASHINGTON/TOKYO Japan's Takata Corp is considering a bankruptcy filing for its U.S. unit as the air bag maker looks for a sponsor to help pay for liabilities related to its faulty inflators, a person briefed on the matter told Reuters.Takata has been working to choose a financial backer for its turnaround as it faces huge costs related to the global recall of millions of potentially faulty inflators. A company-appointed steering committee has retained investment bank Lazard Ltd as an adviser for the process. The company is struggling to supply replacement parts for the potentially defective inflators, which have been linked to at least 16 deaths worldwide, mainly in the United States, and have led to the industry's largest ever recall, with about 100 million ordered to be withdrawn globally.A Chapter 11 filing for its U.S. unit, Michigan-based TK Holdings, which accounts for nearly half of Takata's global sales, was one option it was considering although no filing was expected soon, the source said.A filing would not be imminent because the company still had to select a sponsor and finalize terms, and reach an agreement with automaker creditors, the source said.Takata on Friday reiterated its eagerness to reach an agreement with its automaker customers over the restructuring, ideally by year end, although it added that any decision ultimately would be made by the steering committee.  ""Our preference would be to restructure debts through an out-of-court settlement with creditors. This has been our position since the start, and has not changed,"" Takata CFO Yoichiro Nomura told reporters at a results briefing. ""Aside from that, we're open to all options."" He added that an out-of-court settlement would be preferable to a court-ordered bankruptcy for all of the company's global operations as it would ensure a stable supply of inflator replacement parts required in the recall. PROFIT FORECAST RAISED The tussle over bankruptcy is likely to delay by months the naming of a rescuer and completion of Takata's restructuring plans that were earlier expected to be finished this year, sources told Reuters last month.Bidders for the company include Japanese inflator maker Daicel Corp and Sweden's Autoliv, sources have said, while its creditors include the world's largest automakers including Honda Motor Co, the Renault/Nissan alliance and Ford Motor Co. Mounting air bag-related costs have pummeled Takata's profits, with the company last year booking its third annual loss in four years, while its share price has dropped 90 percent since 2014.The company on Friday said the risk of rising air bag-related costs meant that it would not issue a dividend for the first half.Still, it raised its full-year net profit forecast to 20.0 billion yen ($193.87 million) from the previous estimate of 13.0 billion, banking on a boost from asset sales in the first half, including its sale of its interiors unit.This forecast largely excludes the impact of the recalls as the company so far has only outlined a small number of related liabilities. If Takata were found to be solely responsible for the inflator defect, it could face a bill of about $13 billion for recalls announced so far, based on calculations from experts and automakers including General Motors.It also faces U.S. lawsuits.These potential liabilities would dwarf the company's war chest of around 72.4 billion yen as of the end of September. So far, automakers have paid most of the recall costs while Takata and its customers thrash out how to divide responsibility.Trading in Takata shares was temporarily halted on Friday after the Nikkei business daily initially reported it was preparing for a possible bankruptcy filing.($1 = 103.0200 yen) (Additional reporting by Chang-Ran Kim in Tokyo; Editing by Stephen Coates and Muralikumar Anantharaman)",2016-11-04,F,"Fri Nov 4, 2016 | 5:53pm EDT","UPDATE 3-Takata mulls bankruptcy for U.S. unit, filing will take time - source",http://www.reuters.com//article/autos-takata-idUSL4N1D45WT?type=companyNews
1129,"  (Adds detail on results, context)By Allison MartellTORONTO Nov 6 Canadian workers at Ford Motor Co  voted to approve a new four-year contract with the automaker, the Unifor union said on Sunday, wrapping up months of contract talks.The union said in a release that 58 percent voted to approve the deal, but Oakville local president Dave Thomas said only 45 percent of members at his unit supported the agreement.""Bargaining is always tough, but reaching this contract was no small feat,"" said Chris Taylor, who chaired the union's Ford bargaining committee, in a release.Talks kicked off in August between Unifor and General Motors Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Ford. Workers approved contracts at GM and Fiat Chrysler in September and October. The labor agreements each promise hundreds of millions in new investment in the automakers' Canadian operations, in some cases contingent on government support.The Ford contract closely resembles the GM and Fiat Chrysler agreements, and covers workers at Ford's Windsor, Ontario, engine plants and some office and warehouse employees in Windsor and Edmonton, Alberta, as well as the Oakville assembly. Workers will get $12,000 in bonus payments over four years, and 2 percent raises in the first and fourth years of the agreement.Ford has promised to invest C$713 million ($533 million) in its Canadian operations, including C$613 million in Windsor, the union said in a pamphlet distributed ahead of the vote. The investment will update production of a V8 engine and add assembly of a new fuel-efficient motor for large pickup trucks, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.But the deal maintains a 10-year wage progression for new hires that is unpopular with some Ford workers, especially in Oakville. It also includes a significant concession on pensions, offering new hires a defined contribution pension plan, instead of a plan that guarantees some benefits no matter how pension investments perform. In a public letter and interview in early October, Thomas said a deal similar to the one approved at GM would likely be rejected in Oakville, where 5,000 of the union's nearly 7,000 Ford employees work. But ahead of the vote, he and other local union leaders endorsed the tentative contract.The union practices pattern bargaining, selecting one of the three automakers to negotiate with first, and then insisting rivals agree to broadly similar deals.Ahead of bargaining, union leaders said securing new investment would be their top priority in talks.Separately on Sunday, Unifor members at Magna International's Integram seating unit rejected a tentative agreement, triggering a strike.

1132,"   By Norihiko Shirouzu | BEIJING  BEIJING Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co said on Tuesday it is aiming to more than double its annual vehicle sales to two million cars globally by 2020, riding growth in its Volvo brand and its new Lynk & Co brand. Geely said on its official Wechat micro-blog account that it plans to launch more than 30 new or significantly redesigned vehicle models and aims to become a top 10 global automaker by volume by 2020.Since its acquisition of Swedish luxury brand Volvo from Ford Motor Co six years ago, Geely has taken a lead among Chinese automakers seeking a foothold in the global market. Geely Chairman Li Shufu and Volvo chief Hakan Samuelsson are pursuing a strategy combining Volvo engineering with Chinese capital and manufacturing. State-owned Chinese automaker SAIC Motor and Great Wall Motors Co among others are also looking at breaking into advanced Western markets including the United States.  Buoyed by the fast-selling Geely GC9 and its crossover SUV variants, which Geely developed with engineering help from Volvo, sales of Geely cars, including those sold outside China, have been growing faster than the company forecast at the outset of this year.  Geely initially projected sales for 2016 at around 600,000 vehicles, but has revised its projection twice and is now forecasting sales of about 700,000 vehicles. “We should be able to sell one million cars next year,” said a Geely official who declined to be named because that figure is not an official company forecast. Until recently Geely executives have said their cars are not ready for sale in markets such as Europe and the United States dominated by global automakers like Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE), General Motors Co (GM.N) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T).Geely's latest moves indicate the company, controlled by billionaire Li Shufu, is now emboldened to take on mature markets.Last month, Geely unveiled a new brand of cars called Lynk & Co developed in part with Volvo. Geely is aiming Lynk at the middle of the global market. Lynk cars will go on sale in China next year and in Europe and the United States in 2018, the company said. Geely is expected to build Lynk-brand cars at a new joint plant with Volvo in Taizhou, in eastern Zhejiang province.The plant, operated by Volvo, is expected to start ramping up production this quarter, and will produce compact cars based on an ""advanced"" vehicle architecture called Compact Modular Architecture (CMA) which the two companies developed together in Sweden.

""He will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico,"" the President-elect tweeted.But Ford has repeatedly said it has no plans to close any U.S. plants and likely could not do so under the terms of the current United Auto Workers contract that expires in 2019.This is not the first time Trump's comments about Ford production have been called into question. Last year, he took credit for Ford moving work from Mexico to Ohio, while the automaker had already made the decision in 2011 - long before Trump announced a run for president.Spokeswoman Christin Baker said Ford ""confirmed with the President-elect that our small Lincoln utility vehicle made at the Louisville Assembly plant will stay in Kentucky"". ""We are encouraged that President-elect Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,"" she added, in a statement.The company builds both the Ford Escape and Lincoln MKC SUV at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, which Trump refers to as the ""Lincoln plant"" and where Ford employs about 4,700 people. It also has a separate truck plant in Louisville, where it builds pickups and larger SUVs. It is not clear how many jobs would have been impacted if the low-selling MKC had moved to Mexico. Ford has sold about 20,000 MKC SUVs this year in the United States, compared with 258,000 Escape SUVs.Ford said last month it would suspend production of the Escape and MKC at its Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky for two weeks because of low demand. In 2015, it told workers at the plant that it planned to phase out MKC production by 2019 and move it elsewhere.    The U.S. No. 2 automaker is planning to move some small-car production south of the border.

A Trump spokeswoman did not immediately respond to questions about whether Ford's decision to keep production of an SUV in the United States would cause him to drop plans to impose tariffs on some Ford vehicles built in Mexico.In April 2015, Ford said it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs in all. Earlier this year, Ford said it will invest a further $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018.In September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico by 2019, but no plants would be closed as a result.

1152,"   By David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Ford Motor Co (F.N), one of Donald Trump's prime corporate targets on the campaign trail, offered the President-elect a chance to claim a victory late on Thursday by informing him it would not shift production of a Lincoln sport utility vehicle to Mexico from Kentucky.Trump jumped at the chance, claiming in a tweet that he had ""worked hard"" with Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. to keep the plant in Kentucky, even though Ford had never considered moving the whole factory south of the border. In letting Trump claim a victory, Ford made what appeared to be a calculated, public appeal to the next president in an attempt to soothe concerns about outsourcing jobs and to gain some leverage with the new administration as the automaker pushes for favorable policy changes in Congress. ""Ford is not going to make a decision on a purely political basis,"" said Kristin Dziczek, director of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan.   ""They are going to make a decision that makes business sense, economic sense and if it happens to align with political goals, that's great,"" she said.The No. 2 automaker in the United States is not the only company in Trump's crosshairs working out how to deal with the new political reality in Washington.Apple Inc (AAPL.O), criticized by Trump for not building products in the United States, is studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to the United States, Japanese news service Nikkei reported on Thursday.Apple did not reply to a request for comment on Friday. JOBS = VOTES Trump campaigned heavily on bringing jobs to the United States and attacking companies such as Ford that plan to take some production overseas, a message that resonated in the economically ravaged center of the country. Ford gave Trump plenty of ammunition, confirming in September that all of its remaining small-car production in the United States, at its facility in Wayne, Michigan, would go to lower-cost Mexico by 2019. Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said no plants would be closed as a result, and no U.S. jobs would be lost as capacity at the Wayne plant would be taken up by two new models.  The Mexico plans remain in place, despite the fact that Trump vowed on the campaign trail to stop Ford opening a new plant in that country and promised to slap 35 percent tariffs on any Ford vehicles made there.  Ford went further this month, announcing on Election Day a new $195 million investment in India to add 3,000 jobs over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said this week it would import its Ford EcoSport built in India to the United States. Trump has not made any public comment on that plan.BOTH CLAIM VICTORY On Thursday, Ford said it had been reviewing where to build the Lincoln MKC, just one vehicle built at the Louisville assembly plant, but had decided to keep it in Kentucky.  As such, nothing changed, but letting Trump announce the decision gave him the opportunity to claim he saved U.S. jobs and cast Ford as a patriotic manufacturer.""Both sides will claim a certain level of victory because nobody wants a significant negative impact on the industry,"" said Dave Cole, chairman emeritus of the Center for Automotive Research.It was unclear how many, if any, jobs were actually saved by the decision. Ford decided last year to move MKC production by 2019, on the assumption that production of the Ford Escape, a similar vehicle made in the same plant, would grow. But recently Escape demand has slumped, which may have prompted Ford to reconsider.According to Cole, Ford's olive branch to Trump was a clear indication that it needs help from the next administration as it faces a host of issues from fuel economy standards and the rise of autonomous vehicles to trade and currency.Cole said Trump, who boasts about his dealmaking skills, may choose to focus on bargaining with companies he has targeted - even if only for small concessions - rather than pursue more punitive measures such as tariffs, which would take time to implement and potentially damage the economy.Ford nodded to those wider issues in a statement on Friday, saying it was encouraged that Trump's economic policies ""will help improve U.S. competitiveness."" Ford, like other global U.S. corporations, agrees with key aspects of Trump's economic plans. It has called for U.S. tax reform and raised concerns about the costs of federal regulations. Ford also shares Trump's concerns about currency manipulation.

1155,"  COLOGNE, Germany Ford (F.N) wants to raise profitability in Europe by adding higher-margin versions of the Fiesta subcompact, its best-selling regional model, the carmaker's top European executive said.High-volume carmakers such as Ford have for several years  been squeezed in a downmarket expansion by luxury rivals including Daimler's (DAIGn.DE) Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen's (VOWG_p.DE) Audi.But Ford, which already targets premium buyers with higher-end versions of some of its larger cars under the Vignale label, now wants to take further advantage of that opportunity too.    The next-generation Fiesta, unveiled late on Tuesday in front of 2,500 staff, dealers and reporters at its Cologne plant, will come with advanced safety features and cater to more customers with new crossover and upscale variants.""Having that kind of special feeling in a mainstream product is where the market is going and where Ford as a brand needs to go to make money in Europe,"" Ford Europe CEO Jim Farley told Reuters. ""We don't want to build commodities anymore.""But Farley declined to say what contribution to profitability the new Fiesta may make. Ford has sold more than 17 million Fiestas globally since the first version came to market in 1976. Benefiting from costs cuts and growing sales of higher-margin SUVs, Ford may increase profit in Europe to around $1 billion this year, on a par with its nine-month gain in the region and up from $259 million last year, a spokesman said.Farley noted a full-year profit target of $600 million had already been exceeded in June. Ford has also positioned the 10,000-euro ($10,644.00) Ka+ city car below the Fiesta's base model to target budget customers, Farley said.    Still, it remains to be seen whether new offerings for the redesigned Fiesta and other models will give Ford an edge in the crowded European market.Ford sales in Europe may decline 5.2 percent to 1.4 million vehicles by 2025 from an estimated 1.47 million this year, compared with a 2 percent drop at General Motors' (GM.N) Opel division to 1.14 million and a 4.6 percent gain to 2.16 million for the VW brand, according to IHS Markit. Separately, Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields said the carmaker will start testing its autonomous vehicles in Europe next year.

1157,"   By Bernie Woodall and Joseph White | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) will raise $2.8 billion in long-term debt, according to a filing with U.S. securities regulators, funds which a senior executive said on Monday will help fund investments in new technology including self-driving cars.Joe Hinrichs, Ford president of the Americas region, said the funds would largely go for investment in new technology including electric vehicles, self-driving vehicles, and mobility efforts such as ride-sharing and ride-hailing. ""It’s an opportunistic time,"" Hinrichs told Reuters in an interview on Monday morning. ""It’s a supportive marketplace for long-term debt given where rates are, and we want to make sure that throughout the cycle of the industry we have the flexibility to do what we need to do and want to do, especially in the emerging part of the business.”In a late Monday afternoon filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Ford said it will raise $1.5 billion in 10-year notes with a yield to maturity of 4.356 percent and $1.3 billion of 30-year notes at 5.291 percent. (here) Hinrichs, who has led Ford's Americas region for four years, said Ford has the manufacturing flexibility to make more of its Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator large SUVs as the two models undergo their first total makeover in 14 years.Hinrichs did not say how many of the new models it hopes to sell. ""Suffice to say it is a big opportunity for us,"" Hinrichs said of the new versions of the large SUVs. General Motors Co (GM.N) has dominated the large SUV part of the U.S. auto business in recent years, although Ford invented the segment about two decades ago.This year, through November, GM's four large SUVs have outsold Ford's two entries more than 3-to-1. But Ford's big SUV sales are up 33 percent this year, to GM's rise of 18 percent. It is too early, Hinrichs said, to determine the impact of any changes that may come to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which President-elect Donald Trump has said he will renegotiate.Last week, as the U.S. unemployment rate showed a nine-year low, economists said the path is clear for an interest rate hike this month by the Federal Reserve.

1158,"   By Joseph White | DETROIT  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) is stockpiling 2017 model F-150 trucks, delaying delivery to dealers while it runs final tests on a new 10-speed transmission, a top executive told Reuters.The trucks should be delivered by the end of the year, Joe Hinrichs, head of Ford's automotive operations in the Americas said in an interview on Monday. ""We are launching the new Raptor and F-150 with the new 10-speed transmission,"" Hinrichs said. “We continued building but we’re holding (trucks) longer so we could do more testing and make sure everything is right before we release them,” Hinrichs said.Extra testing is surely prudent in an industry plagued by frequent and costly automotive safety recalls. But Ford's shipping delays come as rival General Motors Co (GM.N) is aggressively trying to cut into Ford's lead in U.S. pickup sales.Taking aim at the ""Built Ford Tough"" ad campaign, as part of a bid dominate the lucrative light truck and sport utility vehicle market, GM rolled out a series of hard-hitting TV commercials over the summer. Punching holes, literally, in the lightweight aluminum beds featured in Ford's new line of pickups, the ads tout the alleged advantages of the roll-formed, high-strength steel beds in GM's trucks. The Ford F-series line of pickups has been the best-selling model line in the United States for 34 years, and Hinrichs predicted 2016 will make it 35 years in a row.      Ford did not disclose how many F-150 pickups it is holding. But several hundred vehicles were stored earlier this week behind a chain link fence on an empty factory parking lot in Detroit. More were parked on Tuesday near the Detroit-Wayne County airport. Many were well-equipped Limited or Platinum models with sticker prices above $50,000.Ford designed the 10-speed transmission jointly with GM. The 2017 model F-150s equipped with a 3.5 liter six-cylinder engine and the 10-speed automatic gearbox get a one mile per gallon improvement in fuel economy over comparable 2016 models with  six-speed transmissions, according to federal fuel economy data. Ford remains the leader in large, light duty pickups with 733,287 F-series trucks sold on the U.S. market through the end of November, according to sales figures compiled by Autodata Corp. However, Ford in October said it would cut a week of production at a Kansas City assembly plant that builds F-150s. GM has sold 718,994 of its large pickups during the same 11 months. GM said in November it had increased inventory on U.S. dealer lots by 111,000 vehicles at the end of the third quarter. GM, Ford and other major automakers in the United States are promoting holiday-themed discounts and financing deals to clear out inventory by the end of the year.December is a critical month for truck sales, said Pete DeLongchamps, vice president of manufacturer relations with Group 1 Automotive, a Houston auto retail chain. ""I expect them to be aggressive.""

1159,"  DETROIT Ford Motor Co (F.N) by Wednesday had released for sale more than half of the 15,000 F-150 pickup trucks with 10-speed transmissions that were held to ensure quality, a company spokeswoman said.Reuters reported on Tuesday that shipment of some of the 2017 models of the F-150 were being delayed to keep from having quality issues during the first application of a 10-speed transmission.In an interview with Reuters earlier this week, Joe Hinrichs, head of Ford in the Americas, said holding the trucks was the prudent thing to do.""In the normal course of business, when we have a new product launch – this is a new product launch for that transmission – we wanted to be extra sure, to do extra testing,” Hinrichs said. Ford designed the 10-speed transmission jointly with Detroit rival General Motors Co (GM.N).The 2017 model F-150s equipped with a 3.5-liter, six-cylinder engine and the 10-speed automatic gearbox get a one-mile-per-gallon improvement in fuel economy over comparable 2016 models with six-speed transmissions, according to federal fuel economy data. The delayed shipments of 2017 model year F-150 trucks occurred as rival General Motors Co (GM.N) is aggressively trying to cut into Ford's lead in U.S. pickup sales.This year will be the 40th straight year that the F-Series pickup trucks from Ford are the best-selling truck in the United States and the 35th consecutive year of it being the top-selling model of any kind. Hinrichs said the delayed shipments will not affect the company's fourth-quarter profit picture because they will all be shipped by year's end.

1160,"   By Jake Spring | BEIJING  BEIJING Ford Motor Co (F.N) expects China to wait until the last possible moment to announce whether it will extend a tax cut on small engine cars set to expire at year's end and is making contingency plans for various outcomes, an executive said on Wednesday.China's auto industry association, executives and analysts have warned of a potentially steep drop off in sales growth next year if the policy, which halves the purchase tax on cars with engines of 1.6 litres or below, expires as planned at the end of 2016. A government official said in October that the country is considering extending the tax, originally instituted in late 2015 to stimulate the market as vehicle sales flat lined amid a weakening economy.""If there is an announcement about a continuation, I would not be surprised if that announcement is made on literally the last day of year,"" Peter Fleet, Ford's head of sales and marketing for Asia Pacific, told Reuters in an interview. In the face of such uncertainty, the U.S. automaker is planning for three different scenarios, he said: the tax cut expires, it is extended at a reduced rate, or continues in full.""We're proceeding on the basis that the purchase tax incentive ends at the end of the year,"" Fleet said. ""We'll adjust our plans as quickly as we need to in the new year if there is a different set of assumptions."" Fundamental demand for cars will continue to be strong and the tax cut will only result in a marginal change in demand, he said, declining to give exact predictions for 2017 auto sales.Ford is set to announce November sales results for China at later on Wednesday. The tax cut spurred a strong rebound in the world's largest auto market this year with sales for January to October growing 13.8 percent compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers.Analysts predict flat or negative growth in 2017 if the tax cut expires as planned.
