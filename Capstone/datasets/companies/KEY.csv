10,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed the long- and short-term  Issue Default Ratings (IDRs) of First Niagara Financial Group (FNFG) and First  Niagara Bank on Rating Watch Positive following its announcement that it will be  acquired by KeyCorp. Concurrent with this action, Fitch has affirmed the L-T and  S-T IDRs of KeyCorp (Key), and Key Bank, N.A. and revised the Rating Outlook to  Negative from Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows at the end of  this release.  The transaction is valued at $4.1 billion with 80% stock and 20% cash. The deal  represents a price-to-tangible book value of 1.7x with a core deposit premium of  6.7% for FNFG. The deal is expected to be accretive to KEY's earnings in 2018  with an estimated increase that would return tangible common equity to 200 basis  points (bps), improvement to cash efficiency of 330bps and EPS accretion of 5%.  The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2016 (3Q16),  subject to regulatory approval, at which point Fitch will resolve the Rating  Watch Positive on First Niagara. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, Viability Ratings (VRs) Fitch's affirmation of Key reflects our view that the FNFG transaction will  strengthen KEY's franchise in key markets. Post-closing, KEY would have an  improved and strong market position in upstate NY as well as other key markets.  Additionally, the FNFG franchise has a strong retail deposit base which is  currently undervalued given the low rate environment and excess liquidity in the  market. KEY's projected improvements to its efficiency ratio and pre-tax-cost  saves of $400 million are also viewed positively. Further, KEY's pro-forma CET1  ratio of 9.5% is considered appropriate given the risk profile of the combined  entity. KEY will need to successfully complete some balance sheet restructuring  including the disposition of FNFG's $4 billion credit securities. Mitigating  factors are KEY's credit mark of 3% on the loan portfolio which combined with  the projected capital position should support credit deterioration and potential  write-downs from the investment portfolio. The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch's view that integration and execution risks  are high given that FNFG has been an acquisitive bank and has undertaken  significant investment to improve its infrastructure. Thus, Fitch views  integration risk to be higher as KEY assesses and transitions FNFG's technology  and infrastructure to its own platform. Fitch also believes execution risks are higher given the size of this  acquisition and KEY's limited experience. Although FNFG's balance sheet is  modest in complexity, KEY lacks a proven track record of successful  acquisitions. Fitch's previous press release for KEY (dated Oct. 5, 2015 and  available at www.fitchratings.com) highlighted that KEY's ratings would be  sensitive to a sizeable acquisition. In Fitch's view, FNFG's commercial real estate (CRE) business and residential  mortgage portfolio (roughly about $14.7 billion) should continue to experience  steady credit performance. However, Fitch has noted concerns with FNFG's risk  profile given aggressive growth. Further, the company also entered relatively  new business lines such as indirect auto, leveraged lending, and asset-based  lending at a time when competition for loans is fierce. Despite continued stable  asset quality measures, we believe FNFG's historical credit metrics may not be  indicative of future performance.  The placement of FNFG on Rating Watch Positive reflects that its pending  acquisition by KeyCorp can address a number of issues that have been affecting  the company. These include its relatively weak capital position, low  profitability, and rapid growth. Fitch expects to resolve FNFG's Rating Watch  upon the completion of the transaction with KEY, with closing expected in 3Q16,  subject to customary closing conditions, including required regulatory  approvals.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  Similar to most commercial U.S. banks, KEY and FNFG have a Support Rating of '5'  and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's view, KEY and FNFG are not  systemically important and therefore, the probability of support is unlikely.  IDRs and VRs do not currently incorporate any support.  HOLDING COMPANY KEY's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which means it is mandated in  the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are  also equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities FNFG's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its bank subsidiary, First Niagara  Bank, reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which means it is  mandated in the U.S. to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries.  Ratings are also equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding  company and subsidiary default probabilities. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES KEY's preferred securities are rated five notches below its VR. Preferred stock  is notched two times from the VR for loss severity, and three times for  non-performance. Hybrid securities ratings are in accordance with Fitch's  criteria and assessment of the instruments' non-performance and loss severity  risk profiles. Thus, these ratings have been affirmed due to the affirmation of  the VR. FNFG's preferred securities are rated five notches below its VR. Preferred stock  is notched two times from the VR for loss severity, and three times for  non-performance. Hybrid securities ratings are in accordance with Fitch's  criteria and assessment of the instruments' non-performance and loss severity  risk profiles. Thus, these ratings have been affirmed due to the affirmation of  the VR. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  The IDRs and VRs of KEY's bank subsidiary benefits from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of KeyBank NA  are equalized across the group. The IDRs and VRs of FNFG's bank subsidiary benefits from the cross-guarantee  mechanism in the U.S. under FIRREA, and therefore the IDRs and VRs of First  Niagara Bank NA are equalized across the group. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS KEY's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. FNFG's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT KEY's Negative Outlook could be revised to Stable should the bank successfully  execute on the integration of FNFG, credit mark sufficiently addresses any  credit issues, regulators approve the merger in a timely manner, and KEY's  projected figures for the transaction materialize, including internal rate of  return, estimated profitability measures, expected cost saves and solid capital  position in line with its forecasts.  Should operational and integration risks arise that are material to financial  performance as well as the overall risk profile of the entity, KEY's rating  would likely be downgraded. FNFG's ratings will likely be upgraded and equalized with Key upon the  completion of the acquisition. However, FNFG's ratings could come under negative  pressure should KEY be unable or unwilling to complete the acquisition.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR KEY's and FNFG's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to  Fitch's assumption as to capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of  need. HOLDING COMPANY Should KEY begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate trouble accessing the  capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to meet near-term  obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the holding company  IDR and VR from the ratings of KeyBank NA. Should FNF begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate trouble accessing the  capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to meet near-term  obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the holding company  IDR and VR from the ratings of First Niagara Bank. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by KEY and its  subsidiary are primarily sensitive to any change in KEY's VR.  The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by FNFG and its  subsidiary are primarily sensitive to any change in FNFG's VR. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of KEY to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in KEY's IDRs.  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of FNFG to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in FNFG's IDRs.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by KEY and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in KEY's long- and short-term IDRs. The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by FNFG and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in FNFG's long- and short-term IDRs. The rating actions are as follows:  Fitch affirms the following: KeyCorp  --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; Outlook Negative; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a-'; --Senior debt at 'A-'; --Subordinated debt at 'BBB+'; --Preferred stock at 'BB'; --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Support at '5'; --Support Floor at 'NF'.

11,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Wednesday urged federal regulators to block KeyCorp's (KEY.N) plan to acquire First Niagara Financial Group Inc FNFG.O, saying the merger would impede retail banking competition and cost thousands of jobs upstate.The request, unusual for a sitting governor, came 3-1/2 months after Cleveland-based KeyCorp announced plans to buy Buffalo-based First Niagara for about $4.1 billion of cash and stock, in one of the largest U.S. bank mergers of recent years.KeyCorp at the time said the combination would create the nation's 13th-largest commercial bank, with about $135 billion of assets, $99.8 billion of deposits and 1,366 branches in 15 U.S. states. It also projected about $400 million of annual cost savings, including from branch closures.In a letter to the Federal Reserve, the Department of Justice and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Cuomo said the merger should be rejected on antitrust grounds. He said it would add to the tens of thousands of Buffalo-area residents who have difficulty accessing bank branches, and likely force many people to rely on costly alternatives such as payday lenders and check-cashing providers.The merger ""will, by any objective measure, further limit the ability of Upstate New York consumers to access the financial services and products offered by banks,"" Cuomo wrote. ""If the acquisition application is not blocked, we will be forced to consider legal redress.""In a statement, KeyCorp said it has a ""strong commitment to the communities of New York,"" and looked forward to working with Cuomo and his staff to address their concerns.

32,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-Term and  Short-Term Issuer Defaut Ratings (IDRs) of KeyCorp (Key), and Key Bank, N.A. The  Rating Outlook is Negative. The affirmation reflects the strong earnings  profile, stable and diverse business model, and its consistency of performance  through time.   The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes Keycorp (KEY), BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance  Corporation (COF), Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica Incorporated  (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), M&T Bank  Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, NATIONAL RATINGS AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch's affirmation of KEY's IDRs is supported by the company's strong capital  position, solid asset quality performance, diversified revenue mix, and reduced  risk profile. Although gradually improving, the company's earnings measures fall  on the lower end of most large regional banks.  Ratings incorporate KEY's strong capital position, which is amongst the highest  of its peer group with a TCE of 9.60% and CET1 ratio of 11.10% for second  quarter 2016 (2Q16). KEY received no objection to its capital plan this year,  and quantitatively, projected loan losses for 2016 CCAR were slightly below peer  averages, which importantly included the First Niagara Financial Group  acquisition, which closed in August 2016 and received OCC approval in September  2016. Post-closing of FNFG, KEY has estimated a pro forma CET1 ratio of 9.5%. Additionally, given the company's reduced risk profile over the years, credit  performance continues to be better than peers with an average of net charge-offs  (NCOs) of 0.27% and nonperforming assets (NPAs) of 1.18% over the last five  quarters. KEY estimates that its through-the-cycle loan losses are expected to  fall between 40 basis points (bps) and 60bps. Given current NCOs levels at 28bps  for 2Q16, Fitch expects some credit deterioration for KEY, as well as the  industry, as credit losses are likely at unsustainably low levels. Further,  KEY's securities portfolio has virtually no credit risk with approximately 99.7%  of its holdings related to agency securities, the highest levels among the large  regional banks. KEY's exposure to the energy sector is very manageable. At June 30, 2016, KEY  reported $3.1 billion of oil and gas commitments, which represents about 2% of  total loans outstanding. Although KEY has reported a rise in commercial NPAs,  absolute NPA levels continue to reflect solid credit quality. Fitch also considers the company's diversified revenue base as a rating strength  evidenced by noninterest income contributing roughly 44% of total revenues,  consistently above the peer group average. The company has benefited from its  solid commercial platform that reflects its middle-market focused capital  markets business. KEY's profitability measures tend to fall on the lower-end of peer averages such  as return on assets (ROA) and net interest margin (NIM) for the large regional  group, although the gap to the peer group averages is closing. Some of this may  be attributed to the company's above average operating costs and lower loan  yields given large component of commercial and industrial (C&I) loans tied to  LIBOR rates. KEY's NIM is also modest, although, positively, the company has  experienced less NIM compression than some of peers. Incorporated in the  affirmation is that profitability will trend positively and pull to  peer-averages over time. Further, the company's cost savings initiatives should  also lead to improvements in profitability. Fitch's affirmation of KEY also reflects our view that the FNFG transaction will  strengthen KEY's franchise in key markets. Post-closing, KEY would have an  improved and strong market position in upstate NY as well as other key markets.  Additionally, the FNFG franchise has a strong retail deposit base which is  currently undervalued given the low rate environment and excess liquidity in the  market.  KEY's projected improvements to its efficiency ratio and pre-tax-cost saves of  $400 million are also viewed positively. Further, KEY's pro forma CET1 ratio of  9.5% is considered appropriate given the risk profile of the combined entity.  The company has also identified $300 million of revenue synergies that are not  included in the model of the acquisition.  The Negative Outlook reflects Fitch's view that integration and execution risks  are high given that FNFG has been an acquisitive bank and has undertaken  significant investment to improve its infrastructure. Thus, Fitch views  integration risk to be higher as KEY assesses and transitions FNFG's technology  and infrastructure to its own platform. Fitch also believes execution risks are  higher given the size of this acquisition and KEY's limited experience. Although  FNFG's balance sheet is modest in complexity, KEY lacks a proven track record of  successful acquisitions. Of note, KEY has identified 40% of the targeted costs  saves will come from technology and third party vendors, which seems achievable. Further, in Fitch's view, FNFG's commercial real estate (CRE) business and  residential mortgage portfolio (roughly about $12 billion) should continue to  experience steady credit performance. However, Fitch has noted concerns with  FNFG's risk profile given aggressive growth. Further, the company also entered  relatively new business lines such as indirect auto, leveraged lending, and  asset-based lending at a time when competition for loans is fierce. Despite  continued stable asset quality measures, we believe FNFG's historical credit  metrics may not be indicative of future performance. Mitigating factors are  KEY's estimated credit mark of 3% on the loan portfolio which combined with the  projected capital position should support credit potential deterioration. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES KEY's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR for loss severity.  KEY's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times for loss  severity and three times for non-performance, while KEY's trust preferred  securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two times for  non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and  assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk profiles  and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of KeyBank, N.A. are rated one notch higher than  KEY's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  KEY's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR KEY has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, KEY is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT KEY's ratings are primarily sensitive to its ability to successfully integrate  FNFG. In assessing this, Fitch will consider KEY's ability to integrate and/or  consolidate information technology systems, while demonstrating progress towards  achieving key financial objectives of the transaction, such as internal rate of  return and expected cost savings. Positively, KEY received regulatory approval  to close the transaction and has indicated that it is on track to achieve its  targeted $400 million of cost saves.  Although not expected, KEY ratings would be sensitive if the credit mark on  FNFG's loans or securities proved to be insufficient.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for KEY and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to KEY's VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long-and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to KEY's  long- and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should KEY's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since KEY's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.

In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts.

A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security.

Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent).
