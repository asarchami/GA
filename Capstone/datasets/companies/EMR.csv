Its main customers are operators of data centres and telecoms networks and energy providers and its main rivals are Eaton (ETN.N) and Schneider Electric (SCHN.PA). Siemens could combine the business with its power-distribution activities.Emerson, also exploring options for the rest of its non-core businesses, is talking with private equity firms, including Platinum Equity LLC, about a sale, the people said, which would be simpler and less risky than a spin-off. Other companies have also expressed interest, according to the people.There is no certainty over which course of action Emerson will pursue and no deal is likely until later this year, the people said, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential.Siemens, Emerson and Platinum Equity declined to comment. VALUATION A price of $4 billion would imply an enterprise value of 0.9 times 2015 sales and 18 times EBIT (earnings before interest and tax), capital goods analysts at Barclays said, almost twice the EV/EBIT multiple of Emerson as a whole.The Barclays analysts said Siemens would be able to combine some of its products with Emerson's but they also said: ""We struggle to see at this stage how the company could materially improve the growth and margin profile of this business."" Barclays rates Siemens ""equal weight"". Emerson's network power sales fell 1 percent in the quarter to end-December, reflecting what it called ""mixed conditions in data centre and telecommunications infrastructure spending"". Its profit margin rose to 8 percent thanks to restructuring.That compares with a 6.6 percent operating profit margin at Siemens' energy management unit in the quarter on flat sales.Siemens trades at 2015 EV/EBIT of 15.0, Eaton at 12.5 and Schneider Electric at 11.4.   The remaining non-core businesses that Emerson has been looking to sell include its motors and drives, power generation and remaining storage businesses.Collectively, these assets generate around $200 million in annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, sources have previously told Reuters.

28,"   By Arno Schuetze and Sophie Sassard | FRANKFURT/LONDON, April 20  FRANKFURT/LONDON, April 20 Emerson Electric is launching the sale of its Motors and Drives unit, which could be valued at up to $800 million, as the U.S. group focuses on divisions including heating and air conditioning, according to people with knowledge of the plans.JPMorgan and Centerview Partners, which are advising Emerson on the sale, are expected to send a first information memorandum on the business to prospective buyers by June. Company officials have been in Asia in the past two weeks to scout out potential suitors, two of the people added.Sector peers such as Brazil's WEG, Japan's Nidec , U.S.-based Regal Beloit and Chinese groups Shanghai Electric, Harbin Electric and Wolong Electric are expected to show interest.Based in St Louis Missouri, Emerson announced the sale of the division last summer as part of a wider reorganisation that includes spinning off its network power business, in which German peer Siemens has showed interest. Emerson does not provide specific figures for the Motors and Drives unit, which is part of its industrial automation division with $4 billion in fiscal 2015 sales. Emerson will keep of this division.People following the deal said the unit has about $1.5 billion in revenues and could be worth as much as $800 million based on forecast 2016 EBITDA of about $100 million and sector multiple between 5 and 8. The company said last year that it expects the divestments, equivalent to a quarter of its $20 billion in sales, to be mostly complete by September 2016. It also said it may yet decide to keep some assets including the Motors and Drives division.The division includes French industrial alternator and turbine manufacturer Leroy-Somer, acquired in 1990, as well as UK-based Control Techniques, bought in 1994, which makes drives used in the metals, cranes, mining and printing industries. ""A large part of the asset is France-based, which will deter some bidders as it is always challenging to restructure French companies,"" one of the people said.A takeover by a French buyout group such as Eurazeo , PAI or Wendel is a likely outcome, the person added, and other private equity groups will probably look at the asset too.Emerson, its advisors and the potential bidders either declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.Leroy-Somer was created in Angoulême, France, in 1919, by Marcellin Leroy. It has 29 sites worldwide, among them 16 in France, and employs 7,900 people worldwide. It also makes electric engines for the latest e-Mehari from PSA.

37,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  U.S. factory automation equipment maker Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) has made an offer to acquire pump manufacturer Pentair Plc's (PNR.N) troubled valves and controls division, according to people familiar with the matter.Such a deal would free Pentair from a unit that its chief executive Randy Hogan has called a laggard when it comes to generating cash, while allowing Emerson to expand within its core sectors as it seeks to shed its network power and motors and drives businesses.Pentair has received offers for the valves and controls business from companies other than Emerson, and there is no certainty that it will agree to any deal, the people said. The unit for sale could be valued at around $2 billion, the people added.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Emerson and Pentair declined to comment.Pentair inherited its valves and controls business as part of its $10 billion all-stock merger with Tyco International Ltd's TYC.N flow control unit in 2012.  Its fittings are used in machinery in the chemical, power generation, oil and gas and power generation sectors. As a result, it has suffered from the commodities-driven downturn in the mining and energy industries. Pentair has responded by slashing costs, letting more than 2,000 employees go in the last year, and hiring a new executive to lead the unit. The company has been under pressure since last year from activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP to improve its performance. Emerson announced last summer it would seek to spin off its network power division, which provides equipment and services that stop mission-critical systems from failing including surge prevention, uninterruptible power supplies and precision cooling. It has since said it is also considering a sale of that business.The remaining non-core businesses that Emerson has been looking to sell include its motors, drives and remaining storage businesses.Emerson could announce its final decision on the fate of these businesses in the coming weeks, according to the sources. Emerson Chief Executive David Farr told analysts on the company's second-quarter earnings conference call in May that he could spend billions of dollars in cash on acquisitions in the second half of 2016.""If we could pick up a couple billion dollars worth of things, then we would be very excited about that,"" Farr said.

51,"  U.S. factory automation equipment maker Emerson Electric Co (EMR.N) said on Thursday it would buy pump manufacturer Pentair Plc's (PNR.N) valves & controls business for $3.15 billion in cash, as it expand its core businesses. Emerson, which has been shedding non-core businesses, is focusing on growing its industrial automation business, along with process management, and commercial and residential heating and air conditioning businesses.Reuters reported in July that Emerson had made an offer to acquire Pentair's valves and controls division, which makes fittings and controls used in machinery in the chemical, power generation, oil and gas and power generation sectors.Pentair's valves and controls business will help Emerson capture a nearly 10 percent share of the $105 billion global process automation market, up from 7 percent currently, Emerson said. Process automation involves precision measurement, control, and monitoring of industrial processes. Emerson's process management business, its biggest, reported revenue of $8.52 billion in fiscal year 2015 and accounted for about 38 percent of its total revenue.  Pentair's valves and controls business is headquartered in Schaffhausen, Switzerland, and had revenue of $1.84 billion in 2015.Pentair, which has been under pressure from activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management LP to improve its performance, inherited the business as part of its $10 billion all-stock merger with Tyco International Ltd's TYC.N flow control unit in 2012.Earlier in August, Emerson agreed to sell its network power unit to investment firm Platinum Equity in a deal valued at $4 billion.

65,"   By Ankit Ajmera and Meredith Davis  Rockwell Automation Inc forecast its first full-year rise in sales in three years as stabilizing demand in industries including oil and gas helped the company report higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue.Shares of the company, which makes factory automation systems, rose as much as 6 percent to $124.75 on Monday.Rockwell has been hit by weak oil prices that curtailed customer spending in the oil and gas industry, which accounted for about 12 percent of revenue in the year ended Sept. 30, 2015.Rockwell has been cutting jobs as part of a restructuring plan and estimates gross savings of more than $30 million in fiscal 2017. The company also forecast adjusted earnings of $5.85-$6.25 per share and a 1-5 percent rise in sales for the year. Analysts on average were expecting adjusted earnings of $5.98 per share on revenue of $5.88 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Rockwell's fiscal 2017 sales forecast seemed ""aggressive"" and has a ""risk of negative revisions as the year progresses in a still uncertain environment,"" J.P.Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note. Last week, rival Emerson Electric Co forecast a 1-3 percent drop in underlying sales for the year ending Sept. 30, 2017, citing lower industrial spending.Rockwell said it could consider acquisitions in fiscal 2017 as it looks to drive sales growth. ""We have a strong pipeline of potential acquisitions in various stages that address one or more of three focus areas around the world,"" Chief Executive Blake Moret told Reuters.  Sales in Rockwell's architecture and software business, which makes computers that help run manufacturing processes, rose 1.8 percent to $696.4 million in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30. The business, Rockwell's second biggest, contributed 44.8 percent to the company's fiscal 2016 sales.""We saw positive year-over-year organic growth in the architecture and software segment for the first time this year,"" Moret said.However, sales in the company's larger control products business - which makes motor starters, signaling devices and relays and timers - fell 8.8 percent to $842.2 million, while contributing about 55 percent of overall revenue. Rockwell's net income fell to $185.2 million, or $1.43 per share, from $201.3 million, or $1.50 per share, a year earlierOn an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.52 per share.   Total sales fell 4.3 percent to $1.54 billion.Analysts had expected fourth-quarter earnings of $1.48 per share and revenue of $1.51 billion.Up to Friday's close of $117.56, Rockwell's stock had risen about 14.6 percent this year, compared with a 6.8 percent increase in the Dow Jones U.S. Industrials index.
