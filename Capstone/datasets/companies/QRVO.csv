0,"  (Adds analyst comments)Jan 5 Apple Inc is expected to cut production of its latest iPhone models by about 30 percent in the January-March quarter, the Nikkei reported.As inventories of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus have piled up since they were launched last September, production will be scaled back to let dealers go through their current stock, the business daily reported. (s.nikkei.com/1R9rxvj)Apple's shares were down 2.2 percent at $102.97 in afternoon trading. The stock has lost about a quarter of its value from record highs in April, reflecting worries over slowing shipments.""This is an eye-opening production cut which speaks to the softer demand that Apple has seen with 6s out of the gates,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said. ""The Street was bracing for a cut but the magnitude here is a bit more worrisome.""Shares of Apple suppliers Skyworks Solutions, Qorvo Inc and Cirrus Logic, among others, also fell following the report. Other companies affected include Sony Corp, which makes image sensors used in iPhones, and electronic parts makers TDK Corp, Alps Electric Co Ltd and Kyocera Corp, the paper reported.LCD panel manufacturers Japan Display Inc, Sharp Corp and LG Display Co Ltd will also be hit by the cut in production, according to the report.Production is expected to return to normal in the April-June quarter, the Nikkei reported. However, Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said he was a bit skeptical about the production cut reports.""Apple has been gaining significant market share in pretty much every region, and I'm not seeing a global slowdown,"" Moorhead said. Apple was not immediately available for comment.The parts suppliers cited in the Nikkei report were not available for comment outside their regular business hours.Tepid forecast by Apple suppliers such as Jabil Circuit , which manufactures casings for iPhones, and Dialog Semiconductor GmbH in December stoked fears that iPhone shipments could fall for the first time.Wall Street has also tempered its view on the high-flying stock in recent months. Since early December, about a third of the analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters have trimmed their estimates on Apple.For fiscal 2016, Apple is expected, on average, to grow revenue by under 4 percent, a far cry from the 28 percent revenue growth it achieved in the fiscal year that ended in September.

1,"  Apple Inc (AAPL.O) suppliers Cirrus Logic Inc (CRUS.O) and Qorvo Inc (QRVO.O) on Thursday added to growing worries about slowing shipments of iPhone 6S and 6S Plus by cutting their revenue estimates for the third quarter.Qorvo's shares fell 12.4 percent in after-market trading, while Cirrus' stock slumped 9.5 percent before regaining some ground.The downbeat estimates follow Japanese daily Nikkei's report on Tuesday that output of the latest iPhone models would be cut by about 30 percent in the January-March time frame so dealers could offload stock.    Qorvo cut its revenue estimate for the December quarter to about $620 million from $720 million-$730 million, blaming weaker-than-expected demand for its radio-frequency chips used in mobile devices.Analysts on average were expecting $723.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Cirrus, which gets about three-quarters of its revenue from Apple, cut its revenue estimate to about $347 million from $370 million-$400 million.Analysts on average were expecting $385.9 million for the third quarter ended December. Cirrus, which makes audio chips for Apple, said the revenue cut reflected weaker-than-expected demand for certain portable audio products.Shares of other Apple suppliers, including Skyworks Solutions Inc (SWKS.O) and Avago Technologies Ltd (AVGO.O), were also down. Apple shares were down 0.6 percent at $95.87. Apple suppliers' shares have taken a beating ever since reports about slowing iPhone 6S and 6S Plus demand surfaced towards the end of 2015.

3,"  * Q4 operating profit likely $5.1 bln, weaker than expected* Shares higher after touching 3-mth low on Thursday* Some analysts downgraded forecasts on weak components demand* Growing concerns about IT industry prospects for 2016   (Updates with comments from analysts, share price, background)By Se Young LeeSEOUL, Jan 8 Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Friday its fourth-quarter operating profit likely rose 15 percent from a year earlier, missing expectations and fuelling concerns the tech industry may be in for a tough year of slack gadget sales.Slowing economic growth in China and weaker emerging market currencies are undercutting sales of consumer electronics and gadget components, spelling trouble not only for smartphone market leaders Samsung and Apple Inc but for their suppliers and the broader industry. Samsung said in a regulatory filing its October-December operating profit would likely be 6.1 trillion won ($5.10 billion), compared with a 6.6 trillion won Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate derived from a survey of 30 analysts. Revenue likely rose 0.5 percent to 53 trillion won, the firm said, without elaborating.""Semiconductor earnings were weak and the smartphone industry entered a phase of low growth,"" KTB Investment analyst Jin Sung-hye said.Even so, Samsung shares were up 1.8 percent as of 0124 GMT, outperforming a 0.1 percent rise for the broader market. ""I think Samsung did well considering the weaker tech demand,"" Jin said.Shares of the world's No.1 maker of memory chips and smartphones touched a three-month low on Thursday as investors braced for downside risks, with some brokerages having tipped profit to have fallen as low as 6 trillion won.The guidance was not a major surprise as Samsung Chief Executive Kwon Oh-hyun had warned on Monday that the maker of Galaxy smartphones faced a challenging time ahead due to weak global economic growth. The tech sector was further rattled on Wednesday when Apple shares fell below $100 for the first time in nearly five months on reports of slowing iPhone 6S and 6S Plus shipments for the January-March quarter.Shares in major component makers were also battered. Investors bailed out of Apple suppliers Cirrus Logic Inc  and Qorvo Inc on Thursday after they cut their revenue estimates for the third quarter.LG Display Co Ltd, the world's top liquid crystal display maker, also warned of tough conditions for the January-March quarter and said the panel industry faced oversupply problems.""Currently there's no visible sign of demand recovery,"" said Avril Wu, research director at market analysis firm DRAMeXchange.Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co meanwhile said its 2015 smartphone shipments defied the slowdown and jumped 44 percent, underscoring the tough competitive environment for market leaders Samsung and Apple.($1 = 1,196.5400 won)   (Additional reporting by Yeonsoo Kwak and Joyce Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates)",2016-01-08,QRVO,"Thu Jan 7, 2016 | 8:39pm EST",UPDATE 2-Samsung Elec Q4 guidance underscores tech sector headwinds,http://www.reuters.com//article/samsung-elec-results-idUSL3N14R5VP20160108?type=companyNews
