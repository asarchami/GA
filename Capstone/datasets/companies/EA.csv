6,"   By Liana B. Baker and Malathi Nayak | LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO  LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO Comcast Corp may soon allow customers using its cloud-connected X1 cable box system to buy games from Electronic Arts Inc through their televisions, according to five sources briefed on the plans.Such a partnership would come as the cable company seeks to protect its turf against a new wave of challengers.After two years of testing, Comcast and EA, are close to reaching an agreement to stream video games such as ""FIFA"" and ""Madden,"" into the living rooms of some of Comcast's more-than 22 million customers across the United States, said the sources, who declined to speak publicly before a deal had been struck.Comcast would make the games available on X1, a video operating system with apps and an interface that is considered the most sophisticated in the cable industry, the sources said. It features Internet applications, viewing recommendations and voice control.If the agreement goes through, it would mark the boldest step yet by a cable company to muscle into the territory of leading video-game console manufacturers such as Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp.Comcast has been beefing its x1 system with new features to stop potential customer defections to rival video streaming systems such as Apple TV and Amazon.com Inc's FireTV, which was launched just last month with a slew of games.Apple TV allows users to stream games from their iOS phones and tablets to TV sets, and developers expect Apple to bring gaming directly to its streaming box. FireTV was released with over 100 free and paid games from the likes of Disney and Electronic Arts. Comcast and EA's aim is to make buying games as easy as ordering a pay-per-view movie, sources said. This could create a new distribution model that circumvents console and video-streaming device makers.EA and Comcast, which is awaiting regulatory approval for its $45 billion proposal to buy Time Warner Cable Inc, declined to comment.The TWC deal, which would make Comcast the country's largest cable provider, highlights Comcast's desire to thwart the fresh challenge from the video and entertainment upstarts.A NEW DAWN  For Electronic Arts, a deal with Comcast could represent an important new revenue opportunity.The video game industry has yet to see a sustained recovery in sagging software sales despite robust hardware sales driven by the November launches of Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4 consoles.In January, Redwood City, California-based EA lowered its 2015 revenue forecast - prompted by the sooner-than-expected drop in sales of games for older consoles after the release of the new devices.Under the agreement now being hashed out with Electronic Arts, Comcast will offer action, sports and casual titles from EA's portfolio, including potential titles such as ""FIFA,"" ""Madden,"" ""Monopoly"" and ""Plants vs. Zombies,"" the people said. The game offerings have not been finalized. Customers will be able to turn their tablets into controllers to play the games. Revenue share terms and the exact release date have not been decided.Comcast has been bulking up the capabilities of its X1 service, which can store content on the cloud, and experimenting with new ways to reach viewers.Last fall, it started selling movies for download and streaming through its set-top boxes and XFINITY TV website, which created a new path for Hollywood studios to generate revenue from films after their theater run ends.While Comcast added video subscribers for the past two quarters, after years of losses, it is facing increasing competition for viewership, both online and through streaming boxes. The Xbox and PlayStation, for instance, are now marketed as living room entertainment hubs that offer more than just games.Microsoft and Sony have added media features to their consoles over the past two years like original programming, online video and TV apps -- including Comcast's XFINITY on-demand service. But cable companies so far have not been able to load their set-top boxes with the technology to support gaming.Comcast will focus on casual and family games at first and consider offering other first-person shooter and action games later based on user preferences, the sources told Reuters.(Editing by Edwin Chan and Alden Bentley)",2014-05-02,EA,"Fri May 2, 2014 | 4:11pm EDT",Exclusive - Comcast nears deal to stream EA games to TVs: sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-comcast-gaming-exclusive-idUSBREA410V920140502?type=companyNews

The company also has ""high hopes from the online version of strategy game ""Civilization"" by designer Sid Meier, which will release next year, Zellnick said.Take-Two raised its adjusted revenue forecast to $1.65 billion-$1.70 billion for the year ending March 31, up from $1.4 billion-$1.5 billion.

The latest console version of ""Grand Theft Auto V"" was the fourth-most sold title in the United States last year, NPD said.Players roam an urban landscape modeled on Los Angeles in the action-adventure game. The latest version was launched in mid-November.Sales from the ""Grand Theft Auto"" series, ""NBA 2K15"" and the ""Borderlands"" first-person shooter game franchise raked in most of the revenue for Take-Two in the third quarter ended Dec. 31. The company, which also publishes ""BioShock Infinite"", got about 23 percent of revenue from digital online content.In contrast, revenue was split almost equally between digital and physical sales for rival Electronic Arts Inc, known for its ""FIFA"" football game.Take-Two's adjusted revenue jumped 24.3 percent to $954 million. Adjusted net income rose to $211.6 million, or $1.87 per share, from $210.7 million, or $1.70 per share, a year earlier.Analysts expected a profit of $1.52 per share on revenue of $797.7 million.Take-Two shares gained 61 percent in 2014.

47,"   By Sai Sachin R and Anya George Tharakan  Nov 23 Electronic Arts Inc has little to fear from retailer GameStop Corp's warning about weak sales for EA's just-released ""Star Wars"" title, with analysts agreeing it was too early to predict its success or failure.The videogame publisher's shares fell as much as 7 percent on Monday after GameStop said its sales of ""Star Wars: Battlefront"" were weaker than anticipated.Analysts and one top investor in EA said it was premature to conclude that the warning was a sign of weak demand.The comments from GameStop, the world's largest videogame retailer, do not reflect digital videogame sales and come days before Black Friday, traditionally the biggest shopping day in the United States.GameStop's warning is ""really being driven by an acceleration of digital downloads,"" Cowen & Co analysts said. ""It's too early to sound any alarm bells,"" said Christopher Merwin, an analyst at Barclays. ""The success of 'Star Wars Battlefront' will be largely dictated by how it does digitally.""The videogame industry has been shifting to distributing games digitally in recent years, with increasing bandwidth and easier access on consoles allowing players to download their favorite titles, rather than purchase physical copies.Digital, a higher-margin business, has been growing steadily, and comprised nearly 52 percent of EA's revenue for the year ended March 31. Matt Titus, a shareholder in EA and a portfolio manager at American Century Investment Management, termed Monday's stock move an ""over-reaction,"" adding that the Star Wars title had ""some of the strongest pre-orders in the history of gaming.""American Century is EA's eighth biggest shareholder, with a 3.03 percent stake, according to Thomson Reuters data. An Electronic Arts spokesman declined to comment on early sales of the title or on GameStop's remarks.EA last month raised its forecast for sales of ""Star Wars: Battlefront"" to 13 million units for the year ending March 2016, up from its earlier estimate of 9 million to 10 million.The title launched on Nov. 17, a month ahead of Walt Disney's release of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" the latest installment in George Lucas' space opera franchise.The game is expected to be a popular gift over the holidays for kids, adult Star Wars fans and gamers alike.""I have a 7-year-old, she's probably going to play the game, my neighbor's kids are playing the game ... none of them have ever seen a Star Wars movie and they all want to play the game,"" Titus said.

48,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Dec 15 Early praise for the newest installment of ""Star Wars"" gave a boost to shares of Walt Disney and Electronic Arts, which recently launched a videogame based on the hugely popular space opera.Following prequels between 1999 and 2005 that were widely seen as disappointing compared to the original trilogy that began in 1977, fans at the premiere of ""The Force Awakens"" on late on Monday said the magic was back.On Tuesday, shares of Walt Disney rose 3.75 percent while Electronic Arts, which last month released its ""Star Wars Battlefront"" videogame after three years of development, jumped 5.26 percent.""Healthy chatter after the industry premiere last night in Los Angeles may have motivated some traders,"" said JBL Advisors analyst Jeffrey Logsdon, who covers Disney.Creator George Lucas sold the ""Star Wars"" franchise to Disney in 2012 for some $4 billion and the newest installment opens in most countries this week. It could gross $2.8 billion worldwide, Logsdon wrote in a note to clients. That would put it in the same league as all-time top grosser Avatar, distributed by Fox in 2009.Reviews of the movie are embargoed until Wednesday and analysts will have a reasonable idea of its money-making potential after its first weekend. Movie theater operators Regal Entertainment Group  and AMC Entertainment Holdings were up 3.1 percent and 5.9 percent, respectively. Carmike Cinemas gained 2.9 percent.Electronic Arts' first-person shooter has received less-than-stellar reviews and retailer GameStop last week cut its price for the product.But the movie's long-awaited debut is expected to fuel demand from die-hard Star Wars fans both young and middle-aged, with Electronic Arts estimating it will sell 13 million units for the fiscal year ending March 2016. That could account for almost a quarter of EA's revenue during the second half of the year but such a target could be at risk if the movie does not resonate with fans, said Oppenheimer analyst Sean McGowan.""It's hard to make a case that the game will get a lift from the movie if people don't like the movie,"" McGowan said. ""And if people come out of the movie feeling good about it, they're more likely to buy the game.""Also helping shares of Disney on Tuesday was an announcement it would launch an over-the-top content service in China with Alibaba.Shares of Electronic Arts have gained 56 percent in 2015 while Disney has climbed 20 percent.

53,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  Electronic Arts Inc.'s (EA) announced benchmark-sized senior unsecured notes and  published a 'BBB' rating for EA's existing senior unsecured revolver. A full  list of ratings follows at the end of this release.  Proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for general corporate  purposes, including the payments of amounts due on EA's existing convertible  notes and share repurchases, including the new $500 million share repurchase  program announced concurrently with this offering. Pro forma for the note  issuance, Fitch expects total leverage to remain within its sensitivities at the  'BBB' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) level. Adjusted gross leverage, calculated  using funds from operations (FFO) as described below, was 0.8x as of Dec. 31,  2015.  Fitch previously assigned a first-time 'BBB' IDR to EA on Feb. 4, 2016. The  Rating Outlook is Stable.  The rating reflects EA's solid credit profile and conservative balance sheet, as  well as profitability tailwinds in the video game industry, as a greater  percentage of revenue is being derived from digital distribution. These  strengths are partially offset by revenue concentration in key franchises and  the competitive and hit-driven nature of the video game industry. KEY RATING DRIVERS EA's strong credit profile consists of abundant liquidity, with $2.3 billion in  cash (EA does not break out domestic and international cash balances in their  press release), $966 million in short-term investments, $500 million of revolver  availability, $930 million of free cash flow (FCF) for the last 12 months (LTM)  ended Dec. 31, 2015, and conservative FFO-adjusted gross leverage of 0.8x as of  Dec. 31, 2015. Fitch believes FFO-based metrics are more appropriate than  GAAP-based EBITDA metrics given GAAP treatment of the digital revenues generated  by EA's online-enabled games. EA's digital experience is in line with the video game industry's overall shift  away from physically-shipped, packaged goods towards digitally-distributed games  and content. EA's digital revenues comprised 53% of LTM ended Dec. 31, 2015  total revenues, up from 45% one year ago. A majority of EA's revenue shift will  be to full-game downloads, as games can now be downloaded directly to a player's  console, computer, or phone.  Digital revenue is more profitable than packaged goods revenue and this shift  has caused upward momentum in video game company margins. Fitch expects EA's  operating margin to increase from the mid-20% range to the mid-30% range over  the next five years due primarily to this ongoing shift. The shift to digital revenue, coupled with the company's ongoing efforts at a  more disciplined operating cost structure has materially increased EA's free  cash flow (FCF) generating ability. For LTM Dec. 31, 2015, Fitch-defined FCF was  $930 million, compared to $105 million in FY2012 before the digital shift  commenced. Fitch-defined FCF is expected to be sufficient to fund some level of  share repurchases going forward and is projected to grow from $1.1 billion in  FY2016 to $1.4 billion in FY2019 due primarily to digital revenue growth. EA's  FCF exhibits seasonality around the holiday season, with the majority being  derived in the quarter ended Dec. 31 (EA's fiscal third quarter).  Partially offsetting this secular tailwind is the fact that over 50% of total  revenue is derived from EA's top three franchises. This level of concentration  is less than some of EA's peers, but still represents a risk in Fitch's view.  FIFA is one of EA's top-ranking franchises, with full-game sales comprising 15%  of total revenue over the past two years (excludes live services and extra  content revenue). To combat this, EA, as do most video game companies, dedicates  material R&D spend to develop new franchises and expand existing mid-tier  franchises (around 5 million players) into mega-franchises (around 15 million  players plus) in an effort to diversify its revenue concentration. A number of EA's core franchises (e.g. FIFA, Madden NFL, Star Wars) represent  licensed intellectual property (IP) which can have weaker unit economics than  wholly-owned IP due to the underlying royalty rates and/or minimum guarantees.  Competition for key licenses is intense and the inability to extend or renew a  core franchise license could materially impact EA's cash flows. This risk is  partially offset by staggering license agreement terms and increasing the  switching costs for individual users by developing large online communities for  specific franchises.  The video game industry is inherently hit-driven and highly competitive, which  increases the potential volatility of future cash flow. Some of this risk is  mitigated by the video game franchise model, which has increased the  cash-generating lifespan of certain games and creates some form of recurring  cash flow, depending on the franchise strength. However, video game companies  must keep publishing new and expansionary content for key franchises to keep  customers engaged, which makes franchises still hit-driven to some extent. Fitch expects traditional video gaming will continue to be a significant part of  the overall gaming segment. The introduction of next-generation game consoles  from Microsoft and Sony in late 2013 reinvigorated demand for console hardware  and software, and the current installed base is outpacing prior-generation  trends at this point in the cycle. Nonetheless, Fitch believes that traditional  video gaming is a mature market with industry revenues fluctuating based on  next-generation console introductions and high-profile software releases.  Additional growth in the sector will be driven by the continued emergence of  mobile and social network gaming. The proliferation and technological advances  in smartphones and tablets has led to superior growth in the mobile gaming  market compared to traditional PCs, consoles, and handhelds. EA has successfully  transitioned a number of its core franchises over to the mobile platform, which  has helped contribute to its success in the space. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --GAAP-based revenues decrease by low single-digits in FY2016 due to effects of  revenue deferral for online-enabled games. Thereafter, overall growth is in the  mid-single-digits, driven by continued 10%-20% growth in the digital segment.  Packaged goods revenue declines are in the 5%-10% range as a greater percentage  of games and content are distributed digitally. --Gross margins expand by around 100 bps a year due to shift toward more  profitable digital revenue. SG&A and R&D costs are managed at a fixed percentage  of revenue.  --Capex is consistent with recent trends at approximately 2% of revenues.  --Domestic FCF is used primarily to fund share repurchases.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Positive rating action will likely be forestalled for the foreseeable  future due to minimal business considerations to support the company maintaining  a rating above 'BBB' and secular factors such as competition and the hit-driven  nature of video games. Future upgrades could be considered if there is an  increase in wholly-owned IP as a percentage of total revenue, increased  franchise revenue diversification driven by strength in new or smaller existing  franchises, and/or operating margin expansion exceeds Fitch's expectations. Negative: Negative rating actions are more likely to coincide with a material  shift in financial policy including, but not limited to, the company managing  toward a more aggressive financial strategy or event-driven merger and  acquisition activity that drive FFO adjusted leverage beyond 2x in the absence  of a credible de-leveraging plan. Additionally, negative rating actions could  result if shareholder-friendly activities materially exceed domestic cash flow  generation and drain domestic liquidity, and/or the shift to digital revenue is  weaker than expected. LIQUIDITY At Dec. 31, 2015, EA had $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $966 million  of short-term investments, and full availability under its $500 million  revolver. For LTM Dec. 31, 2015, EA generated $930 million of FCF. The primary  use of cash through Fitch's forecast is expected to be share repurchases;  however, there is $340 million in convertible notes maturing in July 2016 (the  company received notices for $177 million to settle in fourth quarter 2016)  which can be fully funded by cash on hand and projected FCF generation. Fitch  expects EA's overseas cash balances to grow in lieu of repatriation and as the  company utilizes domestic FCF to fund its share repurchases.  FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the following ratings: Electronic Arts Inc. --Senior unsecured bank credit facility 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'. Fitch currently rates EA as follows: --IDR 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

54,"  WASHINGTON, March 21 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected Electronic Arts Inc's bid to revive its free speech defense in a lawsuit filed by former NFL players who accused the videogame maker of using their likenesses in the popular Madden NFL series without permission or proper compensation. The high court left in place a January 2015 ruling by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that rejected the company's free speech claims and said the lawsuit could move forward.

55,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Fresh off a two-year stock rally and a win with its ""Star Wars: Battlefront"" title, Electronic Arts Inc (EA.O) is attracting sizeable buy-in from institutional investors who expect the company to keep doing well with shooter videogames.Even as that rally started to fizzle in the fourth quarter of 2015, roughly 154 pension funds, hedge funds and mutual funds became new shareholders of the company - a net of 87 new institutional purchasers after sellers walked away, according to research firm Morningstar.Buoyed in part by a pipeline of refreshes to already-popular games including ""Battlefield"" and ""Titanfall,"" analysts, too, are optimistic about the stock, with 18 of 20 tracked by Thomson Reuters recommending investors buy shares, with the remaining two neutral.""EA has a really good slate coming up,"" said Mike Hickey, an analyst with Benchmark Company. ""Over the next year it looks like it's positioned to do fairly well."" After launching in late November, sales of the ""Star Wars: Battlefront"" game in just over a month exceeded the target of 13 million copies that EA had established for March. But that commercial success may raise the bar for sales of upcoming games and future potential stock increases.""How are they going to outdo what they've done in the past year to get the kind of stock movement they had?"" said Ascendiant Capital's Edward Woo, one of the two analysts with neutral ratings on EA. EA's stock price tripled through 2014 and 2015 after Andrew Wilson, an Australian trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, took over late in 2013 as CEO and reinvigorated growth, in part by addressing the company's ailing reputation among gamers. In previous years, a string of disappointing titles, including ""Medal of Honor: Warfighter,"" had led to criticism from customers who also complained that they were being gouged for additional game content that was uninspired and filled with bugs. That hurt a company already wrestling with a consumer shift toward gaming on smartphones and tablets.Under Wilson, EA has asked customers for feedback on games before they are released, including large-scale tests to make sure online multiplayer games can bear the stress of heavy traffic. ""It's a shift to focus on the relationships we have with each individual player, and how, in ways that matter to them, we can bring them closer to the games they love to play,"" said spokesman John Reseburg.Like other videogame companies, EA has expanded its smartphone and tablet offerings, including its ""Madden NFL Mobile"" and ""The Sims FreePlay"" games, and tied many of them into versions of the same games played on consoles.  CHASING RETURNS Still, the most recent institutional bets on EA may be coming late. After peaking in October, EA's stock has fallen 16 percent. Since Jan. 1, the stock has fallen 7 percent. Those declines have occurred in part because the company's outlook for the March quarter missed Wall Street's expectations.Short interest in Electronic Arts edged up to 7.5 percent of outstanding shares as of mid-March from 6.7 percent at the end of last year, according to Nasdaq data.  On April 8, there was some unusually large shorting activity for EA, with what appeared to be one or two traders borrowing around $40 million worth of shares to short them, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.Short sellers bet that the price of a stock will fall. They borrow shares and then sell them, hoping to buy them back at a lower price for a profit and then return them to their owner. Three of EA's largest shareholders - Columbia Threadneedle Investments, Lone Pine Capital and American Century Investment Management - pruned their stakes in the company by more than 1 million shares each, according to filings from the end of 2015, although each still has over 6 million shares.EA's stock trades near 18 times expected earnings, in line with its average over the past five years and in line with rivals Activision Blizzard Inc (ATVI.O) and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc (TTWO.O).Wall Street expects EA to report a 1 percent revenue decline  from a year ago in its fourth fiscal quarter, which ended in March, and grow 5 percent in the following fiscal year, according to Thomson Reuters data.

71,"   By Philip O'Connor | STOCKHOLM  STOCKHOLM The Iceland team that grabbed headlines at Euro 2016 has been left out of Electronic Arts's highly-anticipated FIFA 17 video game due to a dispute over image rights, the country's soccer chiefs said. The Football Association of Iceland told Reuters it was approached by EA after the team's successful run at the European Championship, but it turned down the company's offer of $15,000 to use its image rights in the hugely popular game, which comes out annually and features club and international teams. Icelandic FA president Geir Thorteinsson said EA, which has yet to respond to a request for comment from Reuters, declined to negotiate and the game will be released without the Icelandic team. Thorsteinsson said that while he says he understood their position, he was disappointed with how the company had behaved. ""They were under pressure and maybe they would need more time to discuss these things,"" he said, ""but it's about fair and open negotiations, about respect and how you deal with us. ""I feel very badly treated by this hugely profitable company,"" he added.The decision by the FA to reject the offer has in turn upset the Icelandic players that wowed the sporting world at Euro 2016 this summer. The team, representing a nation of just 330,000 inhabitants, knocked out England before they were eventually beaten by hosts France in the quarter-finals of their first major tournament.

72,"   By Philip O'Connor | STOCKHOLM  STOCKHOLM The Iceland team that grabbed headlines at Euro 2016 has been left out of Electronic Arts's highly-anticipated FIFA 17 video game due to a dispute over image rights, the country's soccer chiefs said. The Football Association of Iceland told Reuters it was approached by EA after the team's successful run at the European Championship, but it turned down the company's offer of $15,000 to use its image rights in the hugely popular game, which comes out annually and features club and international teams. Icelandic FA president Geir Thorteinsson said EA, which has yet to respond to a request for comment from Reuters, declined to negotiate and the game will be released without the Icelandic team. Thorsteinsson said that while he says he understood their position, he was disappointed with how the company had behaved. ""They were under pressure and maybe they would need more time to discuss these things,"" he said, ""but it's about fair and open negotiations, about respect and how you deal with us. ""I feel very badly treated by this hugely profitable company,"" he added.The decision by the FA to reject the offer has in turn upset the Icelandic players that wowed the sporting world at Euro 2016 this summer. The team, representing a nation of just 330,000 inhabitants, knocked out England before they were eventually beaten by hosts France in the quarter-finals of their first major tournament.
