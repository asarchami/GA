0,"   By Bernie Woodall  Johnson Controls Inc (JCI.N) shares were down 4 percent on Thursday afternoon after two of the company's three main business units failed to meet Wall Street analysts' expectations.JCI's building efficiency and power solutions units fell short of expectations, while its automotive business surpassed them, lifted by a rise in global auto sales, said Ravi Shanker, an analyst with Morgan Stanley.The company also provided an outlook for its fiscal second quarter that failed to meet Wall Street's expectations.]JCI said it expects fiscal second-quarter earnings of 64 to 66 cents per share, while a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll shows analysts' forecast at 67 cents per share.The Milwaukee-based company's shares fell as much as 6.2 percent in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. JCI shares have not seen such a sharp move downward since an 8 percent drop in July 2012.In Thursday afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, JCI shares were down 4.1 percent at $49.43, while the benchmark S&P 500 index was down 1.23 percent on the day.JCI, one of the world's biggest suppliers of auto parts, met Wall Street expectations as it reported a fiscal first-quarter profit of $469 million, or 69 cents per share, up from $359 million, or 52 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago. Its revenue rose 5 percent to $10.91 billion, beating expectations of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S of $10.73 billion.Johnson Controls makes car interiors and batteries as well as heating, ventilation and cooling systems for buildings.Overall revenue rose, but sales in JCI's building efficiency business fell 4 percent to $3.38 billion, as gains in Asia could not overcome lower demand in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America, the Milwaukee-based company said.Profit in the building efficiency business of $146 million was down 15 percent from a year ago, and at 4.3 percent, it had weaker profit margins than expected, Shanker noted. ""While building efficiency revenues were lower than last year, there are early indications of improving global commercial buildings markets, which should positively impact the business later in the year,"" said Alex Molinaroli, the company's chief executive.A larger part of JCI's revenue came from its automotive segment, where a rise in global auto sales helped boost revenue 10 percent from a year ago to $5.76 billion. Auto industry production in the quarter rose 10 percent in North America, 2 percent in Europe and 14 percent in China, JCI said.Automotive revenue in China, which is centered on seating and generated through non-consolidated joint ventures, rose 33 percent in the quarter to $1.9 billion. Income from its automotive business rose 130 percent to $232 million, JCI said.Earlier this month, JCI sold its automotive electronics business to Visteon Corp (VC.N) for $265 million in cash. JCI's power solutions business sales increased 6 percent to $1.77 billion, and raised income by 12 percent to $308 million.The company forecast profit between $3.15 and $3.30 per share for 2014 with free cash flow of $1.6 billion. A month ago, the company issued a forecast that disappointed Wall Street, which had expected 2014 earnings of $3.31 per share.JCI said expects its fiscal second-quarter earnings of 64 to 66 cents per share, while Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll of analysts shows expectations of 67 cents per share.In the fiscal first quarter, JCI increased its quarterly dividend by 16 percent and completed $1.2 billion in share repurchases.Christian Mayes, an analyst with Edward Jones, said that the company exited the automotive electronics business, which increased sales by 7 percent in the quarter, because it does not want to invest heavily to keep up with new technology in automotive connectivity.""JCI wants to lower capital spending to enable more share buybacks and higher dividends,"" said Mayes. ""They will pay more dividends and share repurchases in the next three years than they are going to bring in free cash flow. So they don't want to be spending a lot on capital expenditure.""(Reporting by Bernie Woodall in Detroit; editing by G Crosse and Nick Zieminski)",2014-01-23,JCI,"Thu Jan 23, 2014 | 1:58pm EST",JCI shares fall despite rise in quarterly sales,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-johnsoncontrols-results-idUSBREA0M0UB20140123?type=companyNews

15,"  (Adds JCI response, update on Unifor's efforts at Toyota Ontario plants)By Bernie WoodallDETROIT, June 4 Unifor, which represents Canadian auto workers, will strike at Johnson Controls Inc's  Whitby, Ontario, plant if the parts maker does not reverse its plan to close the facility in a couple of years, the head of the union said on Wednesday.Unifor President Jerry Dias said at the United Auto Workers convention in Detroit that the Canadian union would ""shut down GM"" at its Oshawa plant, which gets interiors and seats from Whitby, unless JCI changes its plans.Dias said the deadline for JCI to act is August, when the current contract for 300 workers at Whitby expires. Unifor-JCI contract talks at Whitby will probably begin late this month, he said.JCI officials said the company did not comment on labor negotiations.GM said the issue was between JCI and Unifor. ""We are not able to comment on labor issues facing an independent business,"" GM said.Dias said he had met with JCI officials near Detroit on Tuesday to warn them that the union would strike. He said there was no immediate reaction from the company. JCI has not made any physical moves to shut the Whitby plant, Dias said.""They have given us official notification, but I'm telling you, our plant does not close,"" Dias told reporters on the sidelines of the UAW convention in downtown Detroit. ""We will strike the operations unless they reverse their decisions. That is crystal clear.""Dias said JCI's current project to supply interiors to GM at Oshawa runs for about two more years. JCI has said the plant will close after that, he said, and the jobs would move outside Canada. Unifor, Canada's largest private-sector union, has individual contracts with the JCI plants in Whitby and at Tillsonburg, Ontario.At its sprawling Oshawa facilities, GM assembles the Chevrolet Camaro and Impala, as well as the Cadillac XTS and Buick Regal. JCI produces door pads and floor consoles for the Impala, as well as seats for the Camaro.Shares of JCI were up 1.1 percent at $49.08 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading, while GM rose 4.3 percent to $36.78. TOYOTA ONTARIO PLANTS Dias said Unifor was progressing slowly in its effort to organize workers at Toyota Motor Corp's Ontario plants.He said the union had collected more than 3,000 signatures of Toyota workers at two plants in Cambridge and one in Woodstock.In April, Unifor delayed plans for workers at the Toyota plants to vote on whether to unionize. The company had said 7,500 employees were eligible to be in the bargaining unit and to vote, about 1,000 more than Unifor had expected.Dias on Wednesday said the union was checking a list of the names of the 7,500 to make sure that all of them are indeed eligible to be in the bargaining unit.A majority of workers must vote ""yes"" for a union to be formed.

27,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. construction of institutional buildings such as schools and government facilities is picking up after years of sluggishness, the chief executive of manufacturer Johnson Controls Inc (JCI.N) said on Tuesday.As a large maker of climate control systems, Johnson Controls is one of a swath of industrial manufacturers that depend on non-residential construction for demand for their products.U.S. non-residential construction spending on buildings, which tends to be one of the later markets to recover in an economic cycle, has only climbed back somewhat since hitting bottom in early 2011 and remains well off its mid-2008 peak.Johnson Controls' heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment is particularly used in schools, hospitals and institutional projects, spending for which has lagged the broader U.S. non-residential construction market, Chief Executive Officer Alex Molinaroli said. ""It’s clear that there’s more institutional design and development projects going on,"" Molinaroli said in an interview following the company's investor day in New York. ""It’s getting stronger.""He said local and state governments ""are much healthier than they have been in the past."" He said schools are making a ""comeback,"" noting, ""That probably has as much to do with fiscal health, but also these schools just need to be reinvested in, because they haven't been for so long."" Molinaroli said the market was poised for steady growth, As rather than a sharp rebound. Institutional construction should outpace the broader commercial market. ""It’s been behind actually up until now. I think it’s just catching up a little bit,"" he said.Aside from Johnson Controls, manufacturers such as Ingersoll-Rand (IR.N), United Technologies (UTX.N) and Lennox International (LII.N) are tied to spending on commercial construction. Wall Street analysts have been hopeful that non-residential construction could be strengthening.  Shares of Johnson Controls, whose other businesses include automotive interiors and car batteries, rose 1.5 percent on Tuesday after the company detailed its fiscal-year financial outlook during its investor meeting.

Negotiations between CBRE and Johnson Controls are ongoing and a deal is not certain, they added.The sources asked not to be identified because the talks are confidential.

The stock has risen about 11 percent since the start of the year.JCI, whose customers include most major automakers, said its options included a spinoff, divestiture, joint venture or sale of its seating business in pieces.Automotive seating at $17.53 billion and automotive interiors at $4.5 billion accounted for about 51 percent of JCI's $42.83 billion revenue in fiscal 2014. About $10.1 billion of combined seating and interiors revenue came from North America, $9.5 billion from Europe and $2.3 billion from Asia. RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak estimated the value of the seating business at about $7.3 billion. It had a 5 percent profit margin in the last fiscal year, compared with 11.8 percent from the building efficiency business and 9 percent from automotive batteries.JCI's automotive business reported 1 percent growth in revenue, excluding the impact of the strong dollar, in the quarter ended March 31.

45,"  (Adds Getrag valuation, CFO comment and detail on advisers)By Euan Rocha and Allison MartellTORONTO/FRANKFURT, July 16 Canadian automotive parts maker Magna International Inc said on Thursday it would buy privately-owned German car parts maker Getrag for 1.75 billion euros ($1.9 billion), in a bid to expand its automotive transmission systems business.The move is also part of the plan by the world's No.3 autos supplier to win market leadership in certain key vehicle parts. Earlier this year, Magna sold most of its automotive interiors unit to Spain's Grupo Antolin for $525 million.Magna Chief Executive Don Walker said Magna had identified transmissions as a strategic priority, in part because improved powertrains will be crucial to meeting fuel economy targets set by governments around the world.""Transmissions are highly engineered products with long life cycles, which makes them difficult to commoditise,"" he said on a conference call.The deal values Getrag at 8.8 times its expected core earnings, a significant premium to European car parts makers, which trade at an average multiple of 7, according to Reuters data.Walker noted Untergruppenbach-based Getrag is a technology leader in the product area and indicated its joint venture relationships, especially those in China were an attraction. Getrag is a joint-venture partner of Ford Motor Co and counts BMW, Daimler, Renault SA  and Volvo among its clients. It also has significant tie-ups with Chinese auto makers Jiangling Motors Corp and Dongfeng Motor Group.Getrag and Magna had been in on-and-off talks over a combination for 8-9 years and talks intensified after a 2012 review of how Getrag wanted to finance itself going forward, Getrag CEO Mihir Kotecha said on a conference call, adding he expected the deal to close by year-end.While talks about a potential stock market listing as well as conversations with other car parts makers also took place, Getrag and its family owners decided Magna would be not only a financially strong partner, but also make a good technical and geographical fit, he added. A source familiar with the matter said after the close of the deal Getrag's brand and plants would be maintained and no lay-offs were planned, with savings expected to come from areas such as joint procurement.Getrag, which has about 13,500 employees and operates 13 manufacturing and 10 engineering centers in nine countries in Europe, Asia and North America, had consolidated sales of about 1.7 billion euros ($1.85 billion) in 2014.Magna CFO Vince Galifi said that cost benefits of probably 10 percent of enterprise value could be expected.The deal, which including debt and pension liabilities has an enterprise value of about 2.45 billion euros ($2.67 billion), is expected to close near the end of 2015. ""On first glance, Getrag appears to be a solid product fit for Magna, coming at a reasonable price,"" RBC analyst Steve Arthur said in a note to clients.In a note, Wells Fargo analyst Richard Kwas said he thought the deal potentially lessened the odds of Magna being a buyer of Johnson Controls Inc's seating business.Although Magna sold off its interiors business, it retained its seating business.

68,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 26 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed the ratings for Tyco  International plc (Tyco; NYSE: TYC) and Tyco International Finance S.A. (TIFSA),  including Issuer Default Ratings of 'A-', on Rating Watch Negative. The rating  action follows Tyco's announcement of an agreement to merge with Johnson  Controls, Inc. (JCI).  The merged company will maintain Tyco's Irish domicile and be named Johnson  Controls plc, with 44% of shares owned by existing Tyco shareholders. It will  exclude JCI's automotive business, Adient, which JCI plans to spin off shortly  after completing the merger with Tyco. Tyco has obtained a committed $4 billion  bank facility which will be used to fund $3.9 billion of cash to be paid to JCI  shareholders as part of the merger. Fitch expects Tyco's existing notes will  remain outstanding after the merger is completed, as a change of control  triggering event would require both a change of control and a decline in the  ratings, as defined in the indentures, to below investment grade.  A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Negative Watch incorporates Fitch's expectation that leverage and other  credit metrics at the merged company will be roughly similar to Tyco's existing  credit metrics, which in Fitch's view are weak for the company's 'A-' rating. At  Sept. 25, 2015, total adjusted debt/EBITDAR at Tyco was 3x (2.6x when adjusted  to exclude Fitch's estimate of net debt repaid in October 2015). This is higher  than the 2x level that represents Fitch's expected mid-point for Tyco through  the business cycle. An improvement in metrics originally expected by Fitch for  Tyco on a standalone basis could be delayed, or could even temporarily  deteriorate when considering the merged company.  Fitch believes a downgrade of Tyco's ratings would be limited to one notch  although a two-notch downgrade is possible if credit metrics are initially  weaker than Tyco's current metrics and fail to improve. Tyco's ratings could be  affirmed if total adjusted debt/EBITDA appears likely to decline below 2x  shortly after the merger or if free cash flow (FCF)/total adjusted debt returns  to levels near 15% or higher compared to slightly below 10% in 2016 as estimated  by Fitch. In addition to existing debt at Tyco, pro forma debt will include $3.9 billion  of new debt to be issued to help fund the payment to JCI shareholders and a  portion of debt at JCI that will be moved with JCI's building and power business  into the merged company. Fitch estimates total debt at the merged company will  total approximately $11 billion compared to Fitch's estimate of existing debt at  Tyco of $2.4 billion when excluding debt that was repaid in October 2015.  Other considerations that could pressure credit metrics in the near term include  FCF at both Tyco and JCI, which was weak in 2015, and initial costs to realize  long-term annual operating and tax synergies. JCI estimates savings from cost  synergies will total at least $650 million. Recent FCF at Tyco and JCI included  one-time items such as asbestos payments at Tyco and transaction costs at JCI.  FCF should improve in 2016 but Fitch estimates FCF/total adjusted debt on a pro  forma basis for the merged company could remain below 10%.  Fitch expects to resolve the Negative Watch prior to completion of the merger  after it has an opportunity to review details about the merged company's  operating strategy, capital structure, integration plans, and future FCF and  leverage. After Tyco and JCI complete the merger and begin to integrate their  respective businesses and generate synergies, credit metrics could begin to  improve, although the pace of a return to stronger metrics is presently unclear.  Benefits from the combination of Tyco and JCI include cost and sales synergies,  an expanded product and service portfolio, and capabilities to provide and  integrate data and connected systems. JCI estimates services for the combined  company will be approximately 30% of revenue, helping to offset the impact of  cyclicality in the company's end markets. JCI's Building Efficiency business  complements Tyco's fire and security systems and products businesses, as they  serve similar markets but do not necessarily overlap. JCI's Power Solutions  business is distinct from Tyco's business lines but has a strong share of the  global market for automotive batteries and favorable margins (17% in 2015). At Tyco, restructuring actions should decline in 2016 and asbestos payments will  be materially lower following approximately $600 million of payments in 2015 to  resolve a large portion of Tyco's asbestos liabilities. Previous concerns about  tax litigation were significantly reduced following a preliminary accord reached  with the IRS recently to settle outstanding disputes related to the 1997-2000  period for which the IRS claimed that Tyco owed income taxes of approximately $1  billion (not including interest or possible related claims for subsequent  periods).  A final resolution is contingent upon the IRS's application of the agreement to  the 2001-2007 period and, if applicable, a review by the U.S. Congress Joint  Committee on Taxation. The settlement would involve a cash payment to the IRS of  $475 million - $525 million to be shared among Tyco and former affiliates under  a sharing agreement. Fitch estimates Tyco's share would not exceed approximately  $140 million.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Tyco on a standalone basis before the merger with  JCI include: --The negative impact on sales and earnings from currency movements is expected  to continue into fiscal 2016, offsetting much of Tyco's organic growth;  --Tyco's adjusted operating margins, excluding special charges, improve modestly  in 2016 due to restructuring; --Fitch expects Tyco's FCF will be approximately $400 million in 2016, lower  than the $500 million previously expected, partly due to ongoing pressures in  Tyco's end markets, but well above FCF in 2015 of negative $31 million;  --Adjusted debt/EBITDAR declines toward 2x during the next two years;  --Future annual asbestos payments will be relatively low beginning in 2016  following approximately $600 million of payments in 2015 to resolve a large  portion of Tyco's asbestos liabilities;  --The contingent agreement with the IRS is completed successfully. RATING SENSITIVITIES If the merger between Tyco and JCI is completed as expected, metrics for the  combined company could be near to, or slightly weaker, than currently measured  for Tyco on a standalone basis. The ratings could be downgraded by at least one  notch if: --Total adjusted debt/EBITDAR does not decline toward 2x during the two years  following completion of the merger, compared to 2.6x for Tyco (adjusted for debt  repayment in October 2015) at the end of fiscal 2015;  --FFO-adjusted leverage does not decline below 3x compared to nearly 4.7x at  Sept. 25, 2015 which includes the effect of special charges;  --FCF/total adjusted debt is consistently below 10%; --An adverse outcome on income tax litigation impairs Tyco's liquidity or leads  to an increase in debt and leverage.  Fitch does not anticipate positive rating action in the near term. LIQUIDITY Tyco's liquidity at Sept. 25, 2015 included $1.4 billion of cash and a $1.5  billion bank credit facility that matures in 2020. The bank facility backs  commercial paper issued under a $1.5 billion program. Tyco also has substantial  leases, which Fitch considers in adjusted debt leverage metrics.

Its shares were up 2.5 percent in afternoon trading, while Ireland-based Tyco gained 3.4 percent. Johnson Controls' consolidated balance sheet for the fiscal fourth quarter, which will include one month of Tyco results, will show about $4 billion in debt, including from the acquired company and the transaction, said Chief Financial Officer Brian Stief. Johnson Controls, which will be domiciled in Ireland after the merger, forecast earnings of $1.17 to $1.20 a share for the quarter, which began on July 1. Analysts on average were expecting $1.19, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The estimate excludes the impact of the Tyco deal as well as other non-recurring items such as transaction, integration and separation costs and year-end pension and post-retirement mark-to-market adjustments.  The first analyst day for the combined company will be on Dec. 5. Johnson Controls reported net income of $383 million from continuing operations for the third quarter ended on June 30, down from $503 million a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings came to $1.07 per share. Analysts on average had expected $1.03.Income in the company's building efficiency segment, which includes heating, air conditioning and ventilation units, rose to $397 million from $272 million. The segment showed revenue growth of 3 percent in North America and 9 percent in Asia, Chief Executive Officer Alex Molinaroli said during a conference call with analysts. ""We're seeing some strength in China, which is really encouraging,"" Molinaroli said. Asked how Britain's June 23 vote to leave the European Union affected the segment, Molinaroli said: ""I think people are in a wait-and-see mode. We do see some indications of a slowdown, but I don't know that we would be the bellwether for the UK.""The company receives only about 3 percent of its revenue from the United Kingdom, he said. Total net revenue fell about 1 percent to $9.5 billion, missing analysts' expectations of $9.6 billion.The company attributed the decline to unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the termination of its automotive interiors joint venture with China-based Yangfeng Automotive.

The segment showed revenue growth of 3 percent in North America and 9 percent in Asia, Chief Executive Officer Alex Molinaroli said during a conference call with analysts. ""We're seeing some strength in China, which is really encouraging,"" Molinaroli said. Asked how Britain's June 23 vote to leave the European Union affected the segment, Molinaroli said: ""I think people are in a wait-and-see mode. We do see some indications of a slowdown, but I don't know that we would be the bellwether for the UK.""The company receives only about 3 percent of its revenue from the United Kingdom, he said. Total net revenue fell about 1 percent to $9.5 billion, missing analysts' expectations of $9.6 billion.The company attributed the decline to unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the termination of its automotive interiors joint venture with China-based Yangfeng Automotive.  The spinoff of Adient, Johnson Controls' automotive seating and interiors segment, is still on track for completion on Oct. 31, the company said. Adient will also be domiciled in Ireland, with a tax rate of 10 percent to 12 percent. Johnson Controls said it now expected fiscal-year earnings of $3.95 to $3.98 a share. It previously had forecast $3.85 to $4.00.
