0,"  Jan 28 United States Steel Corp said on Tuesday it was applying for permits to build an electric arc furnace at its Alabama steelmaking plant to replace a blast furnace, a move by the loss making company to cut costs and revamp one of its older, less efficient operations.U.S. Steel Chief Executive Officer Mario Longhi declined to say what the new furnace at its Fairfield Works operation would cost but said it would have a steel production capacity of about 1.1 million net tons per year.The Pittsburgh-based company, faced with a market weighed down by excess steelmaking capacity and weakening demand, plans to cut costs over several years. Electric arc furnaces melt steel scrap, rather than iron ore, to make high-quality steel and would reduce the company's cost of transporting raw materials such as iron ore and coke to the Fairfield operation and reduce its exposure to the merchant coal market.Electric arc furnaces form the backbone of steelmaking operations at Nucor Corp., U.S. Steel's profitable rival. ""The business case for this project as we see it today is strong enough, which is why we're filing for the permits now and we have started the basic engineering for the new facility,"" Longhi said on a conference call with company analysts and investors. Permitting is expected to take up to a year after which construction of the furnace could begin in the third quarter of 2015 with the project completed in mid-2017.U.S. Steel reported a wider fourth quarter loss on Monday as total steel shipments declined compared to last year.",2014-01-28,MRO,"Tue Jan 28, 2014 | 6:58pm EST",U.S. Steel seeks electric arc furnace at Alabama plant to cut costs,http://www.reuters.com//article/ussteel-furnace-idUSL2N0L221E20140128?type=companyNews
1,"  Jan 27 United States Steel Corp reported a wider fourth quarter loss as total steel shipments declined compared to last year.The Pittsburgh-based steelmaker had a net loss of $122 million, or 84 cents per share, compared to a loss of $50 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier.Net sales fell to $4.27 billion from $4.49 billion last year.The company took a $302 million non-cash charge linked to the previously announced permanent closure of iron and steelmaking operations at its Hamilton, Ontario mill. The move, part of a cost-cutting initiative dubbed ""Project Carnegie"" after steel magnate Andrew Carnegie, should cut costs in a market weighed down by excess steelmaking capacity.Steel output fell 2 percent in the United States in 2013, as steelmakers responded to weak prices. Even so, there were noticeable price increases in the second half of the year as demand improved. Excluding after-tax non-cash restructuring and other charges, U.S. Steel's adjusted loss fell to 27 cents a share, from 41 cents a share.Analysts, on average, had been expecting a loss of 25 cents a share on revenue of $4.36 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Income from the flat-rolled segment, its biggest unit by shipments, rose to $87 million from $11 million last year.The company expects total reportable segment and other business income from operations to increase moderately in the current quarter from the fourth quarter.Shares of the company fell as much as 4.3 percent in after market trading.",2014-01-28,MRO,"Mon Jan 27, 2014 | 8:10pm EST",UPDATE 1-U.S. Steel loss widens as steel shipments fall,http://www.reuters.com//article/ussteel-results-idUSL3N0L202I20140128?type=companyNews

3,"  NEW ORLEANS, March 24 Marathon Oil Corp  said on Monday it will buy back an additional $500 million of its shares after it completed a $1 billion share repurchase using proceeds from the sale of interest in a block offshore Angola.The buy back is part of Marathon's strategy to improve  investor returns and grow output from oil producing fields in Texas, North Dakota and Oklahoma while selling mature assets in the North Sea.The company's plans to accelerate drilling in the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Woodford shales is on track with 28 rigs running, Marathon Chief Executive Officer Lee Tillman told the Howard Weil energy conference on Monday.Marathon has opened a data room for marketing its North Sea businesses in the United Kingdom and Norway and bids are due in the second quarter, the Houston company said.The company now has $1.5 billion remaining under its current share repurchase authorization, it said. Shares of Marathon edged down less than 1 percent, or 5 cents, to $34.34 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

4,"  (Adds CEO Longhi's comments on automotive industry)By Krista HughesWASHINGTON, March 25 United States Steel Corp  could replace another one of its older blast furnaces with an electric arc furnace, Chief Executive Mario Longhi told Reuters on Tuesday.U.S. Steel said in January that it was applying for permits to build an electric arc furnace to replace the blast furnace at its Fairfield, Alabama, facility, part of a push to cut costs.""We are moving ahead with the first one,"" Longhi said. ""And there is a lot of analysis going on, given the fact that we have plenty of blast furnaces, to see where, if, when the next one could be replaced by another electric arc furnace.""U.S. Steel's profitable rival Nucor Corp has long specialized in steelmaking with electric arc furnaces, often called mini-mills. U.S. Steel and Nucor are the biggest U.S.-based steelmakers. A sustained shift towards mini-mills would be a big change in strategy for U.S. Steel, which has generally focused on maintaining its fleet of blast furnaces.Electric arc furnaces can use steel scrap, rather than iron ore, to make steel. They can cut costs associated with transporting raw materials, and insulate steelmakers from increases in the price of iron ore and coal.Longhi declined to name blast furnaces that could be replaced, but said there are several options: ""One factor is what is the age of a certain blast furnace, when it is going to come up for a massive reline,"" he said. Relining a blast furnace can cost $100 million or more. ""ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL"" On the growing use of aluminum in the automotive industry, Longhi, who earlier in his career spent 23 years at aluminum maker Alcoa Inc, was cautious.""I would say aluminum has been very hard at work,"" he said. ""I think steel has been somewhat asleep at the wheel.""He said the steel industry is behind on research and development, and that U.S. Steel is ""intensifying"" its work in the area.Automakers' demand for aluminum, which is more expensive than conventional steel but also lighter, is growing rapidly as manufacturers push to improve fuel efficiency.

6,"  (Adds stock price, cash figure, more on outlook)April 29 United States Steel Corp returned to profit in the first quarter, but the steelmaker said Tuesday it expected reduced operating income in the second quarter as cold weather slowed transportation of raw materials and finished products.The Pittsburgh-based steelmaker also said it expects to report a loss in its flat-rolled segment, its biggest unit by shipments, in the second quarter. Its shares fell in after-hours trading.""The extraordinary weather conditions resulted in significantly higher natural gas costs as well as operating inefficiencies and logistical issues that negatively impacted shipments in the first quarter,"" U.S. Steel said in a statement. Although market conditions in North America are improving for flat-rolled products, U.S. Steel said average realized prices in the second quarter are expected to be similar to the first quarter.The company, however, expects to be able to put operational difficulties behind it by the end of the second quarter. U.S. Steel's shares fell 2.5 percent in after-market trading. The stock had closed at $26.34 in New York, up 2.4 percent.For the first quarter, U.S. Steel reported net income of $52 million, or 34 cents a diluted share, helped by higher commercial prices for its products and the impact of the company's cost-cutting program. That compared with a loss of $73 million, or 51 cents a diluted share, a year earlier, and analysts' expectations for earnings of 32 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.First-quarter revenue dipped to $4.4 billion from $4.6 billion.U.S. Steel said it had $1.1 billion of cash at the end of March.

9,"  (Adds earnings comparisons, stock movement)May 6 Marathon Oil Corp's first-quarter profit easily beat Wall Street's expectations on Tuesday, helped by asset sales and a jump in North American shale production.The company posted net income of $1.15 billion, or $1.65 per share, compared with $383 million, or 54 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Marathon closed on the sale of its Angola assets in the first quarter, posting an after-tax gain of $576 million. Excluding the sale and other one-time items, Marathon posted net income of 88 cents per share.By that measure, analysts expected earnings of 72 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company reported a 10 percent jump in its North American shale production, which primarily focuses on plays in Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota. Overseas, production dropped 14 percent due to a strike in Libya curtailing shipments from that country and aging fields in Norway and the United Kingdom.Marathon said the sale of its North Sea assets was on schedule and that bids are due this quarter.Shares of Marathon rose 1.7 percent to $36.80 in after-hours trading. As of Tuesday's close, the stock had gained 2.5 percent so far this year.

11,"  May 11 Russian steelmaker Severstal  has put its North American operations on the auction block, according to people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reported on its website.Officials at Severstal were not immediately available for comment Sunday afternoon. Severstal's North American operations, comprised of two steel plants in Michigan and Mississippi, could fetch $1.5 billion or more, some of the people said, the paper reported in an article dated on Friday. Severstal, Russia's second largest steelmaker, has fielded interest from at least two potential buyers, some of the people said, citing United States Steel Corp and Brazil's Companhia Siderurgica Nacional SA, according to the article. Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel is said to be most interested in Severstal's mill in Dearborn, Michigan. The plant services U.S. automakers in Detroit with long coils of sheet steel, the essential building blocks of cars and trucks, and is near a U.S. Steel facility, the paper said.

12,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault  May 22 Marathon Petroleum Corp is poised to expand its growing Midwest and Gulf Coast fuel trading operation to the East Coast with Thursday's deal to buy Hess Corp's retail network and transport contracts.The purchase will give Marathon control of Hess's gasoline stations and access to pipelines, including the capacity to ship approximately 40,000 barrels per day on the sought-after Colonial Pipeline from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast, according to the companies. The $2.9 billion deal is expected to close late in the third quarter.Chief Executive Officer Gary Heminger said the deal will ""further leverage"" the company's refining and logistics assets, ""providing an outlet for an incremental 200,000 (barrels per day) of assured sales from our refining system.""That likely means opening up new trading opportunities. Marathon's nearest refinery is nearly 500 miles east of New York City in Canton, Ohio, with few major pipelines in between. Shipping fuel north from its Texas and Louisiana plants should offer new opportunities for enterprising traders.""Marathon is not seen as a big, active, trader, so it will be interesting to see if that changes,"" said Robert Campbell, a New York-based analyst at consulting company, Energy Aspects.The purchase would allow Marathon to complement its diesel export business, bringing gasoline into New York Harbor as it sends distillate to Europe, he said.Marathon has shipped about 3.3 million barrels of distillate fuels out of the country in the past 12 months, sending shipments to destinations including Mexico, Panama, El Salvador, the Netherlands, and the Philippines, according to data compiled by Reuters. Marathon's exports trail those of integrated global oil companies like Shell and BP, and merchant traders like Vitol and Trafigura. ""Marathon will probably look at bringing blended product from the Bahamas into Florida and also move product out of the Midwest into Pennsylvania and PADD 1,"" Campbell said.A massive oil storage facility in the Bahamas may offer the chance for traders to use lower-cost ships to transport fuels to the East Coast from the Gulf Coast, where Marathon operates two major refineries. Shippers may use lower-cost foreign ships to transport oil through the Bahamas, bypassing regulations that require special ships for use between U.S. ports.The deal will not include the nearly 40 million barrels worth of petroleum product storage terminals up and down the Eastern seaboard that Hess sold last year to Buckeye Partners LP  for $850 million.It is not clear how the lack of company-owned storage terminals may affect Marathon's trading plans, although many owners - including Buckeye - typically lease out their tanks since they don't own their own retail outlets. Marathon didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.EAST COAST OPPORTUNITIES The purchase of Hess's network will unite the fourth and fifth largest U.S. gasoline retailers, making it the largest company-owned and -operated chain in the nation by revenue. With a major position on the East Coast, Marathon could also become an important player in the New York Harbor market, where benchmark U.S. gasoline and diesel prices are set.Marathon doesn't trade ""much"" now, but that's likely to pick up when they take over retail outlets, said an East Coast-based products broker.Hess has long been a major importer of gasoline and other fuels into the East Coast until a year ago, when it scaled back by about 75 percent on a monthly basis, according to data from the Energy Information Administration.In 2012 it imported 19.8 million barrels of products to the region; by contrast Marathon imported just 84,000 barrels.But Marathon has become a growing force in both Midwest and Gulf Coast markets since spinning off from oil producer Marathon Oil Corp in 2011. Marathon purchased the 475,000-barrel-a-day Texas City refinery from BP Plc in 2012, along with four marketing terminals and contracts to supply 1,200 retail sites in the U.S. Southeast.This year Marathon increased its stake in the 1,830-mile Explorer Pipeline to 25 percent. Explorer transports diesel, fuel oil and jet fuel from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest.It also boasts 64 company-owned and -operated light product terminals, two part-owned and non-operated and 60 third-party light product terminals across the Midwest and Southeast, plus 200 owned or leased barges that mainly transit the Ohio River, according to its website. It also owns 170 transport trucks and 2,165 owned or leased railcars. Last year it also sold 74,000 bpd of ethanol blended into gasoline, it says.

13,"  (New throughout, adds comment from executive, background on tubular steel trade case.)June 2 United States Steel Corp said on Monday it is idling two facilities in Pennsylvania and Texas that make tubular steel, saying the plants are losing money partly because of unfair trade from low-cost rivals in other countries.The steelmaker said the move will affect about 260 employees at the loss-making plants in McKeesport, Pennsylvania and Bellville, Texas, which will be idled in early August.The shutdowns come in the midst of one of the biggest steel trade cases in years, over imports of specialty steel pipe used to drill for oil and gas, known in the industry as oil country tubular goods. ""While these are difficult decisions, they are necessary in order to return our company to sustainable profitability and position us for future growth,"" said U.S. Steel Chief Executive Mario Longhi in a release.""We will continue to fight unfair trade by foreign competitors who are creating a detrimental impact and threat to middle-class paying manufacturing jobs."" In February the Commerce Department opted, in a preliminary decision, not to impose duties on oil country tubular goods from South Korea, although it did find that several other countries were selling the goods below cost. The investigation came after a petition from U.S. Steel and several other producers with operations in the United States, and the preliminary decision sent their shares tumbling.In March, Longhi and other steel industry executives called on trade officials to reverse the decision and impose duties on tubular steel from South Korea.On Monday, Longhi said U.S. Steel is still committed to the tubular business. It will continue to produce and finish the goods in Alabama, Arkansas, Ohio and Texas.

14,"  * Marathon fails to sell smaller UK business* Deal worth $2.7 bln including debt* Det norske shares rise as much as 9 pct* To finance deal through bank loan, rights issue   (Adds detail, analysts, valuation, share reaction)By Balazs Koranyi and Joachim DagenborgOSLO, June 2 Marathon Oil Corp is to sell its Norwegian business for $2.1 billion to oil exploration group Det norske, part of plans to shed assets in Norway and Britain to free up cash for the U.S. firm's shale activities in the United States.The deal goes some way towards Marathon's aim of quitting the North Sea and will transform Det norske into a full-blown exploration and production company.Marathon had said in December it would try to sell its businesses in Norway and Britain to invest in its U.S. liquids-rich shale business in the Bakken, Eagle Ford and Woodford areas.But Marathon said on Monday it did not get an acceptable offer for its smaller UK business. The UK operation produced 15,000 barrels of liquid hydrocarbons a day and 32 million cubic feet of gas per day last year. Under the deal, Det norske, controlled by billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke, will get stakes in 13 fields, increasing its output by around 20 times. It has also secured the financing needed to pay for its share of the $20 billion Johan Sverdrup project, the biggest North Sea oil find in decades.""This will actually transform Det norske from a pure play exploration and development (company) to a full-fledged exploration and production company in one go,"" Chief Executive Karl Johnny Hersvik said.At $2.7 billion including debt, the deal is nearly twice as big as Det norske's market capitalisation and will make the firm the biggest independent oil producer in Norway, where the industry is dominated by state-owned Statoil.The assets Det norske is buying from Marathon produced 80,000 barrels of oil equivalents (boe) per day last year while Det norske's own output was just over 4,000 boe per day. Analysts said Det norske was paying a full price for the assets but this was justified because the fields it is buying are producing and generating cash, allowing Det to make use of tax relief on its investments.""It is a bit expensive,"" Christian Yggeseth, an analyst at Oslo-based Arctic Securities, said. ""In our view they are overpaying by $150 million versus our evaluation.""""The reason why they can justify a higher price is on the back of them having large tax balances ahead of first oil on the Ivar Aasen field and Johan Sverdrup, which they are now thinking of utilising much more efficiently.""CEO Hersvik said he did not believe the company had paid too much.

""Adjusted for (contingent recourses), you come down to a price per barrel of around $17,"" said Oeyvind Hagen, an analyst at brokerage ABG Sundal Collier. ""On a comparable basis we had assumed it to be around $15.8 per barrel. So this was on the higher end. They are not buying cheap barrels here."" For Marathon, the deal is a mixed success as it received no acceptable offers for its UK business, which has been for sale since December, and the firm said it would retain those assets.To pay for the deal, Det norske has secured a loan and was also in talks with four banks over a seven-year, $2.75 billion loan. It would also issue $500 million worth of shares in a fully underwritten rights issue, with Aker ASA, its biggest shareholder, agreeing to subscribe for 49.99 percent of the new shares.

21,"  (Adds comment, context)By Oleg VukmanovicMILAN, July 29 Japanese trading house Mitsui & Co. is in talks to sell its stake in Equatorial Guinea's liquefied natural gas (LNG) export project, a senior source with direct knowledge of the matter said.Mitsui's 8.5 percent stake in the country's LNG facility may be snapped up by one or more of the existing project partners as that would simplify the sale process, a second source said.Stakeholders include U.S.-based Marathon Oil Corp.  with a 60 percent share, state-run Sonagas with 25 percent and Japan's Marubeni with 6.5 percent.""They have been in talks for at least a couple of months now to sell that stake,"" the senior source said, adding that a deal was unlikely to be announced soon. A Mitsui spokesman in Tokyo was not able to comment immediately when contacted by Reuters.Equatorial Guinea LNG (EG LNG) sells its entire annual output to Britain's BG Group which then trades the cargoes to Asian customers at significant markups.Profits from BG Group trades are not shared with the plant's foreign shareholders, giving Mitsui little exposure to Asia and Latin America's booming LNG markets and recent price spikes. BG's contract with EG LNG allows it to buy the LNG from Mitsui and others at a fixed discount to one of the world's cheapest gas benchmarks, the U.S. futures price at Henry Hub in Louisiana, currently trading at $3.74 per mmBtu.BG Group largely offloads the cargoes in Asia, where long-term LNG prices are about $17 per mmBtu. Wanting exposure to Asian markets, Mitsui secured 4 million tonnes per year of LNG export capacity from the Cameron plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast, and has signed supply deals with Japanese buyers.Exports are due to start by the end of the decade.It also bought a 20 percent stake in the U.S.-based Anadarko Petroleum Corp's LNG export project off the coast of Mozambique, from where it plans to ship its first LNG in 2018.Mozambique is locked in a race with Tanzania to become the first east African nation to export LNG after discovering reserves of more than 150 trillion cubic feet off its shores.It is also studying building a LNG import terminal in Brazil with state-run Petrobras, potentially giving it an alternative export destination to its home markets.

Production available for sale from continuing operations, excluding Libya, rose 6 percent in the quarter to an average of 383,000 net barrels oil equivalent per day (boed).The increase was driven by a continued growth in North American shale production, which primarily focuses on plays in Texas, Oklahoma and North Dakota.

27,"  * Islamic State advance raises fears for Kurdistan oil fields* DNO shares down as much as 24 percent* Gulf Keystone Petroleum down as much as 13 percent   (Adds comment from Marathon Oil)By David SheppardAug 7 Shares of energy companies operating in Iraqi Kurdistan plunged on Thursday and two U.S. companies evacuated some staff as Islamic State militants advanced within 45 kilometers (28 miles) of Arbil, a key hub for oil producers.Companies that produce oil in the semi-autonomous region, including Oslo-listed DNO ASA, as well as London-listed Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd and Genel Energy Plc  saw double-digit declines in their share prices as the radical Sunni militants seized 15 towns.While the companies said their oil fields continued to operate, there are growing concerns about the security risks faced by firms active in Iraqi Kurdistan, seen as a beacon of relative stability in the region.""Investors are now taking into account the risk,"" ABG Sundal Collier analyst Oeyvind Hagen said, adding it remained difficult to judge how far into the Kurdish region the Islamists could penetrate.Shares in DNO fell as much as 24 percent and Gulf Keystone Petroleum was down 13 percent at their lowest point, before paring losses. Genel shares were down over 10 percent. Gulf Keystone said it had increased security at its flagship Shaikan field, Iraqi Kurdistan's largest, but added that production and trucking operations were continuing safely.DNO operates the Tawke field, in which Genel is also a partner, which produces around 120,000 barrels of oil per day.Other Kurdistan oil producers including London-listed Afren PLC and Toronto-listed Oryx Petroleum Corporation Ltd , which operates the fields closest to the militants advance, declined to comment. Shares of Oryx were down as much as 11 percent.Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil said on Thursday they were evacuating staff from Kurdistan as the militants advanced. The companies have been drilling and testing new wells in the region. Exxon said little about its Kurdistan holdings at an analysts meeting earlier this year. As recently as last week, Chevron executives told investors they were ""very encouraged"" by initial Kurdistan well results.Marathon Oil Corp, a U.S. oil and gas company that is also drilling in Kurdistan said in a statement that all of its employees are currently accounted for but evacuation is under consideration if the security situation worsens.PESHMERGA PULL BACK  Energy companies have flocked to Iraqi Kurdistan in recent years, hoping to access what is believed to be one of the world's last huge conventional onshore oil deposits.The regional capital Arbil houses many western oil workers and executives, and has seen an investment boom despite tensions with Baghdad over the control of oil sales and revenues.Most worrying for investors this week has been the pullback of the Kurdistan Regional Government's Peshmerga soldiers.Facing militants freshly armed with U.S.-made heavy weapons seized from the Iraqi army, the Peshmergas have given up several towns since Sunday.Witnesses on Thursday said the militants had seized the town of Makhmur, around 40 km from the regional capital Arbil, but Kurdish officials told local media their forces remained in control there and television channels broadcast footage of Peshmerga fighters driving around the town.The militant group said in a statement on its Twitter account that its fighters had seized 15 towns, the strategic Mosul dam on the Tigris River and a military base.DNO, which describes its prospects in Iraqi Kurdistan as 'the jewel in the crown' on its website, was the first international energy company to enter the Iraqi Kurdistan region in 2004.Production from the region accounted for 55 percent of its revenue last year.

28,"  (Adds Marathon Oil evacuations)By David Sheppard and Karolin SchapsLONDON Aug 8 Oil companies in Iraqi Kurdistan withdrew more staff on Friday as the United States launched air strikes to defend the regional capital Arbil from Islamic State militants and Britain told its citizens to leave.Iraqi Kurdistan-focused shares have fallen as investors reassess what was previously viewed as a stable semi-atonomous region. Some of the biggest oil operators in the region have lost almost a quarter of their market value this week.London-listed Afren and Toronto-listed Oryx  said on Friday they were cutting production at oilfields closest to the fighting.Genel, led by ex-BP CEO Tony Hayward and one of the biggest producers in Iraqi Kurdistan, said it was withdrawing ""non-essential"" workers but maintaining the combined 230,000 barrel per day output from its large Taq Taq and Tawke fields.Marathon Oil Corp also said on Friday it was evacuating personnel from the region and all were safe.Kurdish production totalled about 360,000 barrels per day in June, according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency. About a third of that was exported, though Baghdad has been working to block sales outside its central system.Production has been cut by less than 5,000 barrels per day so far, according to company statements, but there are concerns that this could increase.U.S. military aircraft bombed Islamic State artillery attacking Kurdish positions southwest of Arbil, the Pentagon said, the first U.S. air strike since the militants started their advance across northern Iraq in early June. The Eurasia Group consultancy said that while the strikes may help the Kurdish Regional Government defend major cities, energy infrastructure remains at great risk.""The fact that most energy assets are located in the western part of the Kurdish region, and therefore closer to ISIS (Islamic State) controlled regions, presents a sustained threat to these developments,"" said Ayham Kamel, Eurasia's Middle East and North Africa director.""Clashes with the Islamic State close to the Kalak refinery and the Kurmala-Fishkhabour oil export pipeline significantly increase risks to Kurdish energy infrastructure and potential expansion plans."" The Kurmala pipeline carries crude from Genel's Taq Taq field into the broader KRG pipeline system, though the field lies some 40 km (25 miles) to the southeast of Arbil.Genel's Tawke field is close to the Turkish border, far north of the fighting.The Kurdistan Regional Government's oil pipeline through which it has been pumping oil to Turkey since December was operating normally on Friday, flowing 120,000 bpd of oil, industry sources told Reuters.Sunni fighters from the Islamic State, an al Qaeda offshoot bent on establishing a caliphate and eradicating unbelievers, have routed Kurdish troops in the past week to get within a half-hour drive of the prosperous capital Arbil. Britain told its citizens on Friday to leave Arbil and other parts of Iraqi Kurdistan close to the fighting warning the security situation could ""deteriorate quickly"".SHARES DOWN Genel recouped some of an early decline after it reassured investors about its continued operations, but fell 2.3 percent and has lost 20 percent of its value since last Friday.Gulf Keystone Petroleum, another Kurdistan-focused oil producer, lost 2 percent, recovering from a 10 percent fall early in the session but down 24 percent since last Friday.The firm said it had increased security at its flagship Shaikan field, which lies more than 60 km (37 miles) northwest of Arbil, far from the fighting. It said production and trucking operations were continuing safely.Afren fell 1 percent, while Oryx shares slipped 0.4 percent.Barda Rash, Afren's only producing oil asset in Iraqi Kurdistan, is 60 percent owned by the company. It was producing a gross average of 785 bpd of oil in the first quarter, making it a relatively small field. Afren's other operations in Iraqi Kurdistan continued to function normally.Oslo-listed oil producer DNO defied the trend, climbing 5 percent on the back of a technical buying rebound. In early trade on Thursday, DNO fell by as much as 24 percent as investors took fright.U.S. oil major Chevron had already announced on Thursday they were evacuating some staff from Kurdistan. An industry source said Exxon Mobil was also evacuating.

U.S. Steel's shares jumped to a high of $46.54, putting them among the top percentage gainers and the most heavily traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

32,"   By Euan Rocha and Allison Martell | TORONTO  TORONTO United States Steel Corp's Canadian unit had sought a wide range of relief measures from the Ontario government before it filed for creditor protection in Canada earlier this week, according to a source familiar with the matter.The source, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, said the steelmaker had sought environmental liability waivers, an extension on the deadline to fully fund its pension plans in Canada and forgiveness of a C$150 million ($137 million) loan granted by the provincial government nearly a decade ago.That loan helped fund a pension plan deficit that existed when U.S. Steel's Canadian assets were still owned by Stelco Inc. Stelco was bought by U.S. Steel in 2007. In a bid to save jobs and help Stelco restructure, Ontario about a decade ago gave Stelco a 10-year period to fully fund its pensions. It also gave Stelco the loan, the vast majority of which was to be forgiven if the pension plans were fully funded by the end of 2015.U.S. Steel agreed to honor that deal when it bought Stelco, but so far it has only been making the minimum required payments to the pension plans. Now, barely a year ahead of the 2015 deadline, its four main Canadian pension plans have a total solvency deficit of over $750 million.The source said that U.S. Steel had asked the government for a roughly 15-year extension on the deadline and also asked for leeway to sharply cut its pension plan funding obligations that currently stand at about C$70 million annually. Earlier on Thursday, a company spokesman confirmed that it had held talks with the Ontario government, looking at ways in which the government could help with its restructuring efforts.""We have been investigating ways in which it might be possible for the senior levels of government to assist in our restructuring efforts,"" Trevor Harris, the company's spokesman, said in an email, without providing further details.Separately, an Ontario government spokeswoman said the government had been working with U.S. Steel for about eight months to help find a ""workable solution"" for its Canadian assets. She did not say what the talks focused on. The company had also sought to restructure under the Canada Business Corporations Act before seeking bankruptcy protection, the source said. One part of that plan involved splitting the company into different parts, with the parent company in the United States acquiring its Lake Erie assets, the source said. That operation is among the youngest traditional mills in North America even though it began production in 1980.Industry insiders see the Lake Erie assets as more viable than the much older assets in Hamilton, Ontario. Additionally,  the environmental liabilities around its Hamilton operations are seen as significant and the size of its retiree base in Hamilton is also much larger.    However, the source said a big hitch in the discussions with the government was the fact that the company was unable to clarify the extent of potential environmental liabilities.In legal filings, U.S. Steel said there have been a number of spills at Hamilton in the past century and discharges into the environment during the normal course of operations.

45,"  * OMV, Marathon Oil consortium wins seven licences* Croatia hopes exploration will help drive growth   (Updates with quotes, details)ZAGREB Jan 2 A consortium of Houston-based Marathon Oil and Austria's OMV won seven of 10 licences awarded on Friday to explore for oil and gas off Croatia's Adriatic coast, part of a bid by the ex-Yugoslav republic to become a regional energy hub.Two licences went to INA, which is owned by the Croatian government and Hungary's MOL, and one was awarded to a consortium made up of Italy's ENI and London-based Medoilgas.""This interest from investors shows that we have potential,"" Economy Minister Ivan Vrdoljak told reporters. ""It's important to know that there are no new sources of oil and gas in this part of Europe, south-east Europe, other than in Croatia."" The exploration licences are granted for a period of five years and the government set an April 2 deadline for the signing of exploration agreements with the winning bidders.Croatia, which joined the European Union in July 2013, has been in recession since 2009 and hopes Adriatic oil and gas can help drive economic growth. The government says it expects investment worth some $2.5 billion from exploration over the next five years. The tender, which ran for seven months, comprised 29 block areas for exploration and future exploitation, eight in the north and 21 in central and southern Adriatic. The size of each block ranges from 1,000 to 1,600 square kilometres.According to preliminary data, gas reserves are more likely to be found in the north while crude deposits are expected in the southern part of Croatia's Adriatic where the seabed is deeper. Local environment groups say oil drilling could harm the Adriatic and Croatia's lucrative tourism industry.""A strategic study on the environmental impact will be completed before the agreements are signed,"" Barbara Doric, head of the national hydrocarbon agency, told reporters.Croatia currently covers about 65 percent of its annual gas consumption of 3 billion cubic metres from its own offshore fields. It hopes to be able to meet its entire domestic demand helped by the new exploration efforts.The country is also running an international tender for onshore oil and gas exploration which expires in February and has revived plans to build a liquefied natural gas import terminal on the island of Krk.

54,"   By Mike Stone | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Feb 19 Elliot Management Corp. and Omega Advisors Inc. are among activist hedge funds buying stakes in North American oil and gas producers whose stock has fallen because of weaknesses exposed by the collapse of energy prices.It's a bet on a view that's contrary to some analysts: that oil prices are poised to rebound. This month Citigroup cut its crude price forecasts, saying West Texas Intermediate could go as low as $20 a barrel before recovering. West Texas crude is currently at about $51 a barrel, up from a low of $43.58 in January.Still, oil prices are down 50 percent from last June, leaving many energy company stocks looking cheap. A Reuters review of regulatory filings, as well as interviews with more than two dozen company executives, investment bankers, lawyers and investors, reveal that many hedge funds are seizing the opportunity to buy shares on the cheap.""Activists are secretly buying up stakes now because they believe the markets have hit rock bottom,"" said Kai Haakon Liekefett, a partner at Vinson & Elkins LLP in Houston who heads the law firm's shareholder activism response team. He said hedge fund activity in the oil patch ""may get hot"" as early as this fall or winter.Activist investors aim to make money by buying shares of companies and then pushing them to change their strategy. This can include raising their dividend, launching a share buyback, spinning off a division, or an outright sale of company.In the case of oil and gas companies, calls for a change in corporate strategy may not come straight away because some hedge funds will wait for energy prices to rise first, boosting the value of the company shares they acquired. That way, a hedge fund may cash out profitably even if its activist strategy fails, or if it decides against moving forward with it.In disclosures this week, hedge funds known for their activist investing, including Elliot and Omega, said they bought stakes in Continental Resources Inc, Marathon Oil Corp , Laredo Petroleum Inc and Sanchez Energy. They are obliged to disclose such stakes in quarterly regulatory filings with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission. In the last six months, since June 19, Continental shares have fallen 36.9 percent, Marathon is down 25.2 percent, Laredo has slipped 52.5 percent and Sanchez has dropped by 60 percent.While the hedge fund investors' immediate intentions are not known, funds are taking advantage of the companies' low valuations to build positions they can exploit later, industry sources said.For example, Elliott, a hedge fund run by billionaire Paul Singer, took a 4.5 percent stake in oil and gas exploration and production company Hess Corp in 2013 and got three seats on its board after a bitter proxy fight with the company's management. It then successfully pushed the company to carry out several asset sales over the next two years. Overstretched oil and gas exploration and production companies with assets in multiple basins, inefficient production and low growth are most likely to fall prey to activists, according to industry executives.For example, Resolute Energy Corp, said last week it would cut down on spending, hampering the developments of its assets and potentially limiting its earnings growth. Resolute's assets are spread out in Utah's Aneth Field, Wyoming's Hilight Field and Texas' Permian Basin.Resolute Energy as well as Laredo are vulnerable to activists because of their weak balance sheet. Their indebtedness, equivalent to 20.61 and 9.85 times of their annual cash flow, respectively, is much higher than the industry average of 5.84 times annual cash flow. This could make them susceptible to activist calls to bolster their finances through asset sales. Laredo and Resolute Energy did not respond to requests for comment. AGITATING NOW OR LATER It is unlikely activists will call for an oil and gas company to explore a sale in this environment, given the effect of low energy prices on company valuations, a view that would align with those of oil company executives. But activists may put pressure on them to shed assets now in a bid to strengthen their balance sheet, as Elliott did with Hess.Activists are betting bet consolidation in the energy sector will occur once oil prices stabilize. Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and other large exploration and production companies will ultimately use their cash piles to make some large acquisitions. Activists may hope companies they are buying into would be the targets.Another strategy activists may demand is that mature oil producing assets be spun off into yield-generating vehicles known as a master limited partnerships (MLPs). This is because the remaining assets that stay with the company will have higher growth, and so the shares held by the hedge fund in that company are likely to get a boost.To be sure, many hedge funds acknowledge that their strategy comes with significant risks. Their bets could be wiped out if the oil price turns against them.""You can have a perfect thesis and argument for what a company should do to unlock shareholder value, but if the commodity price moves down and the share price drops, the value of the proposals could be completely destroyed,"" said Shreyas Gupta, a partner at activist investor Sandell Asset Management, a firm with a history of activist investing.

57,"  CALGARY, Alberta Feb 23 Royal Dutch Shell Plc  said it was shelving plans to build a new oil sands mine in northern Alberta, the largest such project to be deferred as producers struggle with low energy prices.The company said on Monday that it was withdrawing its regulatory application for the 200,000-barrel-per-day Pierre River project. Instead, it will concentrate on boosting the profitability of its existing 255,000-bpd Athabasca oil sands project.""The Pierre River Mine remains a very long-term opportunity for us, but it's not currently a priority,"" Lorraine Mitchelmore, president of Shell's Canadian unit, said in a statement. ""Our current focus is on making our heavy oil business as economically and environmentally competitive as possible."" Mitchelmore said Shell would hold the leases on the mine and could reapply in the future.Shell has regulatory approval to expand its Jackpine oil sands mine in northern Alberta by 100,000 bpd. Spokesman Cameron Yost said he could not speculate on when a final investment decision on that project would take place. The company said that because planning for the Pierre River mine was still in early stages, few jobs will be cut because of the deferral. Shell has a 60 percent stake in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project, while Chevron Corp and Marathon Oil Corp  each hold a 20 percent interest.Total SA and Statoil ASA have also recently postponed oil sands projects [ID: nL2N0RQ2CE]   (Reporting by Scott Haggett and Nia Williams in Calgary; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)",2015-02-23,MRO,"Mon Feb 23, 2015 | 1:10pm EST","Shell shelves 200,000-bpd Pierre River oil sands mining project",http://www.reuters.com//article/shell-pierreriver-idUSL1N0VX1HL20150223?type=companyNews

But a decision by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy has since cut it to 11.57 percent..Sverdrup, Europe's costliest offshore energy project, contains up to 3 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) and could operate for 50 years. Det norske, controlled by billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke's Aker, said it has decided to appeal the ministry decision to the government.""For Det norske, it is a decisive principle that the ownership interests in Johan Sverdrup are to be distributed according to a combination of volume and value. We do not see this principle reflected in The Ministry of Petroleum & Energy decision on the unitization split,"" Chief Executive Karl Johnny Hersvik said in a statement. The field, also owned by Lundin Petroleum, Maersk  and state holding firm Petoro, is forecast to start production by the end of 2019.Det norske has earlier said it was keeping all possibilities open, including taking legal action. Det norske reported an earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of $122 million for the quarter, below expectations for $131 million and $20 million in the same period a year ago.A comparison with earnings figures a year earlier is skewed because Det norske has since acquired Marathon Oil's  Norwegian business, significantly increasing its production and revenue.The firm reiterated its 2015 production forecast of between 58,000 and 63,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.

A source familiar with the matter said that uncertainties about the exact border between Croatia and Montenegro had also affected the planning of the blocs.Croatia's Hydrocarbon Agency, which supervises the project, confirmed on its website the consortium had withdrawn and said a new licensing round for both onshore and offshore exploration would be called in September. ""The project is continuing as planned. From day one, we've seen serious interest from global companies, which is confirmed by daily queries about the possible date of a new licensing round,"" it said.Croatia had expected to sign contracts with the oil companies this month, despite opposition to offshore drilling in the Adriatic from environmental groups and some opposition parties, who said drilling could harm Croatia's tourism industry. Two other licences in the January round had gone to INA  and one to a consortium of Italy's ENI and London-based Medoilgas.Croatia is also set to hand out a round of onshore exploration licences to companies including Vermilion Zagreb Exploration, a unit of Canada's Vermilion, Croatia's INA and Nigeria-based Oando Plc.The awarded onshore and offshore licences would be signed in early September, the Hydrocarbon Agency said.

Analysts on average had expected a loss of 48 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

82,"  (Adds Thomson Reuters data, quotes throughout, changes slug from MARATHONOIL-MARATHONOIL/EQUITY)By Lauren Hirsch and Terry WadeHOUSTON, March 1 Energy companies are dominating this year's U.S. corporate share sales, raising $7.5 billion so far this year, with Marathon Oil Corp the latest to tap the market to bolster balance sheets to weather the volatile price of oil.Share sales by oil and gas companies accounted for one third of the overall equity raised so far by U.S. corporates, a year to date record, with Marathon in an upsized offering of 145 million shares priced at $7.65 late on Monday.On Tuesday, Marathon shares fell as low as $7.56 before rebounding in afternoon trading to $8.00, paring losses to 2.6 percent. While scores of highly-leveraged oil and gas companies are struggling to tap funding, those firms with stronger balance sheets are winning over investors.""Several oil and gas companies still need equity capital, and only the strongest will actually raise that capital through block trades,"" said Michael Cippoletti, Managing Director and Head of US Equity Capital Markets at BMO Capital Markets Corp. Issuers in recent weeks have included Pioneer Natural Resources Co, Cabot Oil & Gas Corp and Hess Corp .The money raised is being used to safeguard credit ratings and position companies to potentially acquire weaker rivals. Such acquisitions are expected to take off when the price of oil bottoms out. Ability to raise funds depends on each company's acreage and finances.""Two key elements include the best relative ability to drill economically at current strip pricing, and balance sheet strength,"" he added.John Hess, chief executive of Hess, which sold equity on Feb. 4, said last week the sale was a proactive move during an oil price downturn and rocky debt markets.Crude oil prices have slumped some 70 percent since mid 2014.

100,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Arathy S Nair | NEW YORK/BENGALURU  NEW YORK/BENGALURU Oil and gas producer Marathon Oil Corp's plans to buy a small Oklahoma producer is the latest signal U.S. shale companies are pouncing on properties in the state's high margin STACK basin as the price of oil rebounds. Marathon Oil said Monday it would purchase PayRock Energy Holdings LLC for $888 million from venture capital firm EnCap Investments. PayRock currently produces about 9,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Anadarko Basin STACK play in Oklahoma. The deal comes after Devon Energy Corp's recent buy of about 80,000 net surface acres in the STACK play from privately held Felix Energy - also part of EnCap's portfolio - for $1.9 billion.The STACK, or Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties play, lies in the Anadarko Basin, which covers about 60,000 square miles in western Oklahoma, southwestern Kansas, and parts of the Texas Panhandle and southeastern Colorado. The play has emerged as a top investment priority for several companies, including Continental, Devon and Marathon Oil in the past year largely because the cost to operate wells in this area is lower than other parts of the United States. That, in part, has made it a prime opportunity for investment as oil prices recover after plumbing 12-year lows earlier this year.  Rig counts have now increased for three weeks in a row, as crude prices recover to near $50 a barrel, suggesting a shift in producers' strategies.More recently in May, Newfield Exploration Co agreed to buy 42,000 net acres in the STACK play for $470 million from a unit of Chesapeake Energy Corp. Marathon Oil had agreed to sell non-core assets for $950 million in April, bringing its total sales through divestitures to about $1.3 billion since last August.    ""It is a little bit of a change, compared to what we've been hearing lately in M&A,"" Imre Kugler, senior consultant in North America Upstream at IHS, said. He said until recently, companies had been focused on selling assets not crucial to their businesses, but the latest Marathon Oil transaction is ""more of an aggressive move.""The most recent production numbers suggest the STACK play is seeing more activity. Continental Resources Inc said production from STACK more than tripled to 11,127 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the first quarter from the year-ago period. Devon's production from the area soared about 39 percent to 91,000 boepd.  To be sure, the play is still in its early stages, but analysts have expressed optimism in its growing potential.
