11,"  LONDON Britain's Court of Appeal on Monday ruled that a lower court should look again at how pay-TV group BSkyB sells its sports channels to rivals, in the latest twist in a near four-year battle.Market regulator Ofcom ruled in March 2010 that Rupert Murdoch's BSkyB should make its two main sports channels available to rivals such as Virgin Media and BT at a lower price.Sky, which built its business around offering exclusive sports programming, responded by taking the case to the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT). When that ruled in its favor, BSkyB's rivals took the case to the higher Court of Appeal.On Monday, the Court of Appeal said it could not uphold the earlier CAT ruling because it had failed to take into consideration whether the prices charged by Sky gave rise to ""competition concerns"" for its rivals. ""The only way in which this error can satisfactorily be dealt with is for the order of the CAT of 6 March 2013 to be set aside and for the matter to be remitted to the CAT for further consideration, findings and conclusions,"" the court said.BSkyB, which offers pay-TV, broadband and telephony to customers in more than 10 million homes, said the CAT would now only look at a very specific aspect of the case. Sky said the ruling did not change the fundamental finding that it had engaged constructively with other distributors over the supply of its sports channels. ""Sky continues to believe that Ofcom's 2010 decision is flawed and that the (wholesale) obligation ought properly to be removed, and will continue to pursue all available options to achieve this aim,"" it said.Shares in BSkyB were up 1 percent at 899.50 pence by 1450 GMT, when the FTSE 100 index was up 1.2 percent. Regulator Ofcom said it welcomed the ruling.""Ensuring fair and effective competition in the pay TV market has always been Ofcom's objective,"" it said. ""Ofcom's 2010 decision that Sky must offer premium sports channels to other providers was designed to deliver choice and innovation to consumers through greater competition.""(Reporting by Kate Holton; Editing by Erica Billingham)",2014-02-17,NWSA,"Mon Feb 17, 2014 | 11:04am EST",UK court sends BSkyB's pay-TV terms back for review,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bskyb-cat-idUSBREA1G0UB20140217?type=companyNews

14,"  LONDON, March 3 Rebekah Brooks, the former head of News Corp.'s British newspaper business, told a London court on Monday she thought the company's ""rogue reporter"" defence to phone-hacking looked shaky in 2009 when she landed the job as chief executive.Brooks also told London's Old Bailey court that Rupert Murdoch's News International funded the legal bills for a man convicted of phone-hacking at one of their tabloids to keep secret any details about who he said might also have been involved.Brooks is on trial accused of conspiracy to intercept voicemail messages on mobile phones, authorising illegal payments to public officials and perverting the course of justice. She denies all charges.Giving evidence for a seventh day, Brooks, 45, was asked about an article in the Guardian newspaper from July 2009 which detailed background to a 1 million pound ($1.68 million)settlement between News International and Gordon Taylor, the former head of the Professional Footballers' Association.Taylor was named as a victim of phone-hacking in 2007 when private detective Glenn Mulcaire, who worked for Murdoch's News of the World newspaper, and the tabloid's royal editor Clive Goodman were convicted.Following the convictions, News International stated Goodman was a ""rogue exception"", the court heard, a phrase that Brooks said was first proffered by the News of the World's then editor Colin Myler.The Guardian article, published when Brooks had been appointed chief executive but before she had taken up the post, said phone-hacking was widespread and not limited to Mulcaire and Goodman.Within a fortnight, further details emerged including an email sent by a junior reporter at the paper with the transcripts of 35 separate messages left by or for Gordon Taylor.

16,"  * Murdoch rejected CEO's resignation at height of scandal* Brooks ran News Corp's UK paper business* Court hears she was escorted out of HQ* Brooks tells how husband hid large porn collectionBy Michael HoldenLONDON, March 4 Rebekah Brooks, former boss of Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper arm, told a London court on Tuesday how the media mogul had persuaded her not to quit amid public revulsion over the hacking of a murdered schoolgirl's phone.Brooks, on trial for phone-hacking offences, said a 2011 report that journalists on Murdoch's News of the World tabloid had tapped the voicemail messages of 13-year-old Milly Dowler had caused a national scandal, with her at its centre, describing it at the time as a ""sexist witch hunt"".Despite the furore, Murdoch and other senior figures told her not to resign, and she told the Old Bailey court that former Prime Minister Tony Blair and CNN talk show host Piers Morgan had also contacted her to offer support.After she finally quit when her role became untenable, she said she was escorted from the company's London headquarters following demands from the police.The outrage began on July 4, 2011, when the Guardian newspaper reported that journalists from the News of the World (NoW) had accessed voicemails on the girl's mobile phone while she was missing nine years earlier, and had deleted some, giving her parents false hope that she was still alive.The scandal led Murdoch to close the 168-year-old newspaper and ditch a $12 billion bid to take full control of British pay-TV operator BSkyB.The court has heard Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective who worked for the paper, has admitted hacking Dowler's phone but police had ascertained he had not deleted any voicemails. Brooks, the NoW editor at the time of the hacking of which she denies all knowledge, said she had been at a fertility clinic with her cousin, who was carrying her surrogate baby, when she was alerted to the news. ""First of all I didn't believe it,"" she said. ""It was pretty horrific.""MESSAGES OF SUPPORT She said the news had stunned bosses at News International, News Corp's British paper business, and as the storm grew, leading to death threats against her, she had been deluged with messages of support from friends and colleagues.""When it rains, it fucking pours. Grit your teeth and stay strong,"" Morgan wrote in a message to her. She replied: ""Terrible, made me feel sick watching the news, can't believe any reporter could do that, must have been Mulcaire.""Later she heard from Blair. ""Thinking of you. Anything I can help you with. I have been through things like this,"" he wrote. In another exchange, a friend suggested the anger directed at her was misogynistic, prompting her reply: ""Feeling slightly like a sexist witch hunt at times.""Days after news of the hacking, the decision was taken to close the paper, which she said had led to anger from its staff because while they were losing their jobs, she was keeping hers.Brooks told the jury there was no immediate suggestion she should quit from her bosses including Murdoch's son James, in charge of News International (NI) at the time.When Rupert Murdoch flew into London on July 10 to deal with the growing scandal, she said: ""He asked me not to (resign),"" adding as the week went on the situation changed.""IMPOSSIBLE TO CARRY ON""  ""Although Rupert Murdoch didn't want me to resign that day, it was obvious it was impossible for me to carry on in that position,"" she told the court. She said there were discussions about whether she should resign or take a leave of absence, complicated by her being summoned to appear before a parliamentary committee the following week.She told the court it was hoped if she went as CEO, Rupert and James Murdoch might not have to appear. In the end, they were called as well.By July 14, it was felt by everyone it would be better if she quit, she said. The following day her resignation was announced and she began a tour of the News International headquarters to make her farewells.She said: ""(NI executive) Will Lewis said the situation had changed, the police want you out of the building immediately. Will did use this phrase something like if you don't leave immediately, they're going to send the pandas (police cars) round."" She was told she couldn't take anything with her.Two days later, she was arrested after going by arrangement to a police station, spending ""quite a few hours"" in a cell.Prosecutors have told the court that her husband Charlie was involved in a plot to remove material from their London flat before police arrived to search it.The jury was told his plan failed because a cleaner found a bag they had tried to hide. Brooks said the day after her arrest, Charlie, who is also in the dock on a charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, had told her about a ""mix-up"".""He said he had given his bag to security. It seemed like a very odd story,"" she said.""He had hidden his rather large porn collection. He then said to me the police had found his bag by the bin. It seemed like a monumental cock-up. It was just kind of the final straw in what had been a cataclysmic few days.""Brooks denies conspiracy to illegally intercept voicemails, authorising illegal payments to public officials and perverting the course of justice.Her trial and that of her husband and five others continues.",2014-03-04,NWSA,"Tue Mar 4, 2014 | 2:05pm EST",UPDATE 1-Murdoch told me not to quit amid phone-hacking row - Brooks,http://www.reuters.com//article/britain-hacking-idUSL6N0M13R120140304?type=companyNews

The announcement comes a day after the BoE Governor Mark Carney faced hours of grilling from lawmakers, a large part which was dominated by the bank's response to allegations that key currency benchmarks had been rigged.The BoE is under pressure from members of parliament to show it can police itself rigorously. Lawmakers have criticized the Bank's governance system, centered on its Court of Directors, as outdated. Last week, the BoE suspended an employee as part of an initial review into the foreign exchange case. The separate investigation by the Court's Oversight Committee, which Grabiner will lead, was announced last week.The conclusions of the investigation are likely to be published only after a separate probe by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Britain's main markets regulator, is completed, the statement said.

22,"   By Michael Holden | LONDON, March 25  LONDON, March 25 Rebekah Brooks's former personal assistant denied on Tuesday that her ""beloved boss"" had paid for flights for her and her family to Australia as a reward for disposing of evidence that might incriminate the ex-News Corp. executive over phone-hacking.Prosecutors say Cheryl Carter, 49, removed seven boxes of notebooks belonging to Brooks, who ran Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper arm News International, and destroyed them as a phone-hacking scandal engulfed the company in July 2011.Brooks and Carter are on trial accused of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice while Brooks also faces charges of conspiracy to illegally intercept voicemails on mobile phones and authorising illegal payments to public officials.They and five others on trial deny all charges.Carter's lawyer Trevor Burke told London's Old Bailey court that Brooks and her PA were ""like sisters"" having worked together for years as Brooks rose to become editor of the Sun and News of the World titles and then News International's CEO. ""They adored each other. They had been shoulder to shoulder for 16 years,"" Burke told the jury. ""You can cross-examine Cheryl Carter for three weeks if you like and she will not say a bad word about Rebekah Brooks.""Burke told the jury the two co-accused ""stand or fall together"". ""If you convict one, you are obliged to convict the other,"" he said.On July 8, 2011, the day after it was announced that the News of the World would close amid revelations its journalists had hacked the phone of a murdered schoolgirl, Carter withdrew seven boxes from the company archives that were marked as containing Brooks's notebooks from 1995 to 2007. The boxes were withdrawn on the same day her request to do so was submitted to the archivist but Burke told the court she had not put him under pressure to ""protect her beloved boss"".The reason to remove them was ""absolutely not"" to do with the paper's closure, but because she said she believed they needed to withdraw material from the archive before it was moved to a new location.Carter, who wrote a weekly article about beauty for the Sun,  told the court that the boxes held few of Brooks's possessions and mainly contained scrapbooks with cuttings of her Sun articles and other magazine beauty features, as well as course work for her college studies on the subject. The court heard Carter received a 17,000 pound pay rise, taking her salary to 66,000 pounds ($108,900) a year, when she followed Brooks to her new CEO position, even though she had no formal secretarial training and did not use shorthand.She also received 7,000 pounds for her weekly Sun articles, although she told the court she did not want a lot of money because she felt ""privileged"" to be writing for the paper.Carter also told the court her family had planned to emigrate to Australia but she had kept this from Brooks until they had both left the company at the end of July 2011.After she broke the news, Brooks agreed to pay the cost of the flights. Asked by Burke if this was a reward for disposing of the boxes, she said: ""I can say that it wasn't. She just wanted to thank me for 16 or 17 years I worked for her.""The trial continues.

23,"   By Jane Wardell and Byron Kaye | SYDNEY  SYDNEY Lachlan Murdoch's appointment to senior positions within his father Rupert Murdoch's media empire marks the return of the prodigal son.Nearly a decade after walking away from the News Corp inner circle in New York to set up his own investment company and settle in Sydney with his young family, it appears Lachlan has accepted the mantle of successor, whether alone or jointly with younger brother James.""It's like the royal family,"" said Alan Knight, professor of journalism at the University of Technology in Sydney. ""Murdoch senior has always treated News Corp as a family business and this guy is just basically accepting his inheritance.""Lachlan, 42, will become non-executive co-chairman of both entertainment company 21st Century Fox and publishing operation News Corp, sharing both roles with his father. He rejoins the company after quitting as deputy chief operating officer in 2005 amid friction with other News Corp executives.However, Lachlan's track record after striking out on his own has been marked by several spectacular failures.His first move, a highly leveraged A$3.3 billion ($3.04 billion) bid with friend and fellow media dynasty heir James Packer for pay-TV company Consolidated Media Holdings fell through as the global financial crisis took hold.Another ill-fated foray with Packer was the creation of telecommunications company One.Tel during the dotcom boom. The pair lost A$1 billion when the company collapsed.As Packer started to exit the media business in favor of building a gaming empire, Lachlan paid A$1.50 per share to purchase a 9 percent stake from his friend in Ten Network Holdings Ltd in 2010. Shares in Ten, Australia's third ranked commercial channel, are now at A$0.27, down 72 percent over the past three years, and it lost almost A$285 million last year. Lachlan is stepping down as non-executive chairman and from the board to avoid conflict with his News Corp roles.""He has never shown any particular innovation in journalism, but he is part of the family, isn't he?"" said Knight.Still, others say that Lachlan had proved himself as chairman of News Ltd before leaving the family firm.""He wasn't backward in coming forward with his thoughts on what the paper was doing well and what it needed to improve,"" David Penberthy, a former editor of Sydney's Daily Telegraph, told local publication The Monthly last year.PROVE HIMSELF  A source who worked with Lachlan in his media investments said it was widely understood that the potential heir wanted to prove himself without his father's backing.Even though the Channel 10 investment failed financially, it allowed Lachlan to stretch his wings as he attempted to direct the upstart station into a more ""grown-up"" competitor for its established rivals, said the source, who requested anonymity as he was not authorized to speak on the record.More successfully, Lachlan bought a 9 percent stake in regional free-to-air television company Prime Media Group Ltd in 2009, selling it for a A$10 million profit in 2012.Also in 2009, he spent A$110 million buying half of DMG Radio Australia, owner of the Nova radio network, taking full ownership three years later. Under his chairmanship, Nova has become Australia's No.1 radio network. News Corp said Lachlan would divide his time between New York and Sydney, allowing him to continue to develop his separate businesses.Lachlan, while London-born and U.S.-educated, is seen as the most ""Australian"" of Murdoch senior's children. His English-born, Australia-raised model wife Sarah has starred as host of the local version of ""Next Top Model"", while two of his three children were born in Sydney.As recently as last June, he told The Australian Financial Review when asked about the prospect of inheriting his 83-year-old father's empire: ""No. No, I've moved on from that.""Still, the signs were there that the door was not closed.He remained on the board during his years in the wilderness and had been seen as his father's likely successor before he left.Among his siblings, he has arguably the most media experience and was untainted by the British phone hacking scandal that ensnared younger brother James.""For a billionaire media mogul with a supermodel wife, he's actually a really down-to-earth guy,"" said Joe Hildebrand, a columnist at the Daily Telegraph in Sydney.

24,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK News Corp, its Chairman Rupert Murdoch and other top officials have won the dismissal of a U.S. lawsuit accusing them of defrauding shareholders by concealing widespread, illegal phone hacking at two of its British newspapers.In a decision made public on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan said the defendants could not be held liable over statements predating the period for which shareholders sought to recoup alleged losses.The case was based on statements by Murdoch, former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks and others in the years after the 2006 arrest of reporter Clive Goodman and investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who were both later imprisoned for allegedly hacking the phones of Britain's royal family.Shareholders led by Britain's Avon Pension Fund accused the defendants of making statements in press releases, interviews, conference calls, testimony to Parliament and elsewhere suggesting that the incident was isolated.Instead, they said hacking was ""widely practiced"" at the since-closed News of the World and The Sun tabloids, and revealed only on July 4, 2011 when news broke that reporters had in 2002 hacked into the cellphone of Milly Dowler, a missing teenager who was later found murdered. Shareholders said this caused News Corp shares to fall 17 percent within two weeks and scuttled its plans to buy British Sky Broadcasting Ltd. They sought to represent shareholders from February 15 to July 18, 2011 in a class action.Gardephe, however, concluded that ""nearly all"" of the alleged false statements predated the class period and that the defendants had no duty to correct them.""To hold otherwise would require adopting an 'endless breach argument,' which would permit plaintiffs to circumvent the well-settled rule that defendants are liable only for those statements made during the class period,"" he wrote. Gardephe gave the plaintiffs until April 30 to file an amended complaint. His decision is dated March 31.Dennis Herman, a partner at Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd representing the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.News Corp spokeswoman Ashley Huston and Jay Kasner, a partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom representing the company, did not immediately respond to similar requests. The decision came nearly a year after insurers for News Corp directors agreed to pay $139 million to the company to settle a separate shareholder lawsuit accusing the board of failing to probe phone hacking.Other defendants in the latest case included James Murdoch, a son of Rupert Murdoch who is now co-chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox Inc and sits on News Corp's board; and former Dow Jones & Co chief executive Les Hinton.Brooks is on trial in Britain for allegedly conspiring to hack phones from 2000 to 2006.The case is Avon Pension Fund v.

32,"   By Michael Holden | LONDON  LONDON Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson would have been incompetent to not know of phone-hacking when they edited Rupert Murdoch's News of the World amid a ""rotten state of affairs"", prosecutors told a London court on Wednesday.Brooks, who later ran News Corp.'s British newspaper arm, and Coulson, British Prime Minister David Cameron's media chief until 2011, are accused of conspiracy to hack mobile phones and authorizing illegal payments to public officials. Brooks also faces a charge of perverting the course of justice by trying to hinder the police inquiry. They deny the accusations.Murdoch closed the News of the World in 2011 amid a public furor over phone-hacking at the paper, which rocked his media empire, sent shockwaves through Britain's political establishment and led to Brooks' resignation.In his closing speech to London's Old Bailey court, prosecutor Andrew Edis said top editors would have known their staff were engaged in illegally accessing voicemails on mobile phones if they were doing their jobs properly.He reminded the jury three senior news desk editors had pleaded guilty to phone-hacking charges. They had worked ""hand in glove"" with Brooks, Coulson and the paper's managing editor Stuart Kuttner, who is also on trial, Edis added.  ""The investigation has clearly proved there was a rotten state of affairs at the top of that organization,"" he said. ""What you have to decide is whether these one or two people above knew of that rotten state of affairs which permeated the organization they were supposed to be running.""It was their job to know. Are these people incompetent? Are they so careless and so unconcerned about what's happening on their watch that they didn't notice?"" he asked. BROOKS DENIES KNOWLEDGE  Edis asked if this was a case ""where young, inexperienced, talented, ambitious, clever, charming people have been placed in a position of great power"" and ""allowed themselves in their excitement of the chase"" to say it didn't matter if what they did was lawful because ""we just want the story"".Giving her evidence, Brooks denied any knowledge of phone-hacking at the paper she edited from 2000 to 2003 while Coulson, her successor as editor until 2007, told the court he had only been aware of one instance of phone-hacking.However, Edis told the jury that Brooks had delivered a ""carefully choreographed, well-scripted performance"" and the jury needed to ""see behind the mask"". ""There has been a fair amount of choreography in some of the way these defenses have been presented to you,"" he said.He also told the court that the prosecution was not an attack on the freedom of the press nor on the tabloid press.""We accept that a free press is an essential part of the protections of a democratic society,"" he said. ""The ultimate protection of a democratic society is the rule of law, that applies to newspapers in the same way as it does to you, me or anybody else.""Closing speeches in the trial of Brooks, Coulson, Kuttner and four others, which began seven months ago, are due to last a few weeks. The jury is expected to be sent out to consider their verdict at the end of the month.

That compares with a $17 million drop in institutional sales in the prior quarter. The company does not break out the total institutional sales number.

38,"  June 18 News Corp's board of directors voted to extend a poison pill provision it put in place to prevent hostile takeovers when the company controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his family split from its cable and entertainment properties last  year.News Corp said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that the provision, triggered if someone acquires 15 percent or more of common voting stock, will last until June 18, 2015. It was originally set to expire on June 28, 2014.In the event an acquirer becomes the owner of more than 15 percent or more of common voting shares, shareholders will get the right to purchase voting or non-voting shares at an exercise price. News Corp is controlled by Murdoch and his family through a trust that has a 38 percent ownership stake of Class B shares with voting rights. News Corp, which owns several newspapers, including The Wall Street Journal; book publishing house HarperCollins and other assets, including stakes in Australian pay-TV networks, separated from what is now 21st Century Fox in June 2013. The company has a history of potential takeovers: In 2004, Liberty Media Corp's John Malone quietly snapped up a 20 percent voting stake in the company. The move prompted Murdoch to swap his stake in DirecTV and other assets for Malone's shares in News Corp.

A law enforcement source and a second source familiar with the matter said the FBI is probing whether News Corp businesses or representatives may have violated U.S. laws, most notably the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which forbids U.S.-based companies from paying bribes to foreign government officials.  News Corp is headquartered in New York City. The company confirmed on Thursday that its lawyers turned over more than 80,000 emails extracted from U.S.-based servers to U.S. Justice Department investigators more than a year ago.

43,"  (Adds quotes, details, background throughout)By Costas PitasLONDON, June 26 Rebekah Brooks, the former boss of News Corp.'s British newspaper arm, said on Thursday she felt vindicated after being found not guilty this week of hacking phone messages and other  crimes while editing Rupert Murdoch's British tabloids.Brooks, 46, was speaking for the first time since she was cleared on Tuesday by a jury at London's Old Bailey court of charges relating to phone-hacking, illegal payments to a public official and perverting the course of justice.""I am innocent of the crimes that I was charged with,"" she said, her voice shaking with emotion. ""I feel vindicated by the unanimous verdicts.""It's been a time of reflection for me. I've learnt some valuable lessons and hopefully I'm the wiser for it,"" she told a large scrum of reporters outside the plush townhouse in central London where she has been staying during the eight-month trial.Prosecutors had alleged that Brooks was complicit in the  widespread hacking of voicemails on mobile phones carried out by journalists working for the now defunct News of the World, a Sunday tabloid and Britain's then biggest-selling paper which she edited from 2000 to 2003. She was also accused of authorising thousands of pounds in illegal cash payments while editing the sister daily paper the Sun, and then bringing in staff and her husband Charlie to try to thwart the police investigation when the hacking scandal engulfed the British political establishment in July 2011.However, following one of the most expensive criminal trials in British legal history, of the seven defendants only Andy Coulson, Prime Minister David Cameron's ex-media chief and Brooks' former lover, was found guilty.Her successor as editor of the News of the World, Coulson now faces jail for conspiracy to hack phones along with four other former senior journalists who had already admitted their involvement.When she was first arrested, her husband Charlie angrily accused the authorities of pursuing a witch hunt, a line her defence team echoed during her trial. MAELSTROM ""When I was arrested it was in the middle of a maelstrom of controversy, of politics and of comment,"" said Brooks, with her husband's arm wrapped tightly around her. ""Some of that was fair and much of it was not. So I'm grateful to the jury, I'm very grateful to the jury for coming to their decision.""Called Murdoch's ""fifth daughter"" by British media because she was so close to the media tycoon, she did not respond to questions about what her future held.""Today my thoughts are with my former colleagues and their families who face future trials. I'm going to do everything I can to support them as I know how anxious the times ahead are,"" she said.Dozens more journalists, nearly all from Murdoch's tabloids, are still awaiting trial over alleged offences arising from the huge police investigation into phone-hacking.Brooks' appearance coincides with a visit by Murdoch to London. Relations between the 83-year-old media mogul and his British journalists have been strained ever since he shut the News of the World to appease public anger at the hacking scandal, and started helping police with their inquiries.Many journalists at the Sun tabloid were left seething after the company formed an internal committee to search emails and internal documents for any sign of illegality.

44,"   By Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Rupert Murdoch looks to have been canny in his $80 billion takeover approach to Time Warner Inc, cornering the media giant at a time when potential ""white knight"" bidders are busy absorbing their own large deals.The absence of potential counter-bidders leaves Time Warner's investors with a dilemma. They can either engage with Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc to negotiate a higher price, or play for time and wait until there are more potential buyers available. Time Warner, owner of many highly-prized assets from  HBO to Warner Bros, has rejected Fox's initial cash-and-stock proposal of $85 per share. An eventual deal would transform the U.S. media landscape and cement Murdoch's status as the most powerful magnate in U.S. media and entertainment.When Time Warner's board rebuffed the approach it indicated it believes now is the wrong time to sell because the environment isn't conducive to getting the best price, people familiar with Time Warner's thinking said on Wednesday. That is mainly because a range of major media, telecom and technology companies are for various reasons not in a position to make a rival offer. Verizon Communications Inc, which last year paid $130 billion to buy Vodafone out of its U.S. wireless business Verizon Wireless, is hampered by the $140 billion debt load that it took on as a result.Comcast Corp, which completed the acquisition of NBC Universal last year, has its hands tied while waiting for the government to approve its proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable. Bidding for Time Warner while that is going on could scuttle the chances of getting the cable deal approved.Elsewhere, AT&T Inc, another large telecom company that hardly produces any programming, is trying to close its $48.5 billion takeover of satellite TV company DirecTV, which is also awaiting regulatory approval.As the media industry landscape evolves, technology companies such as Google, Apple or Amazon could also be tempted into bidding for Time Warner as opposed to trying to produce video content on their own, people familiar with Time Warner's thinking said.  Time Warner shareholder Mario Gabelli told Reuters Insider TV on Wednesday that he thought both Google and Apple were possible bidders. But for now, Google's investment in content is focused on its YouTube unit while Amazon has spent money on original TV shows for its online video service. Apple's media bets have so far been on music, illustrated by its purchase of Beats Music in May for $3 billion. ""If I were Time Warner, I would wait. A year or two from now, they will have competition for the assets actually,"" said an industry banker who is not involved either with Time Warner or Fox.""The only downside of waiting is if you believe that multiples are going to contract in the next year or two. Nobody assumes that the markets are going down,"" the banker said. For Fox, stars seem to be aligned for a deal. Financing remains cheap, making it easy for Fox to borrow the cash it will need for the deal. Its stock, which Fox wants to use to finance 60 percent of its bid, is trading at a lofty multiple to earnings.""In our experience, if Mr. Rupert Murdoch wants an asset, he will wait and pay to get it,"" ISI analyst Vijay Jayant said.   UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE Still, Time Warner shareholders have told Reuters that Murdoch will have to raise his bid and increase the cash component to stand a chance of succeeding.Also companies don't always get to choose the place and time of a battle. Fox's overture could force another company to think hard about making a competing bid, and Murdoch could get trumped. Investors in cable and media have seen this movie before. Earlier this year, Charter Communications went public in its pursuit of Time Warner Cable and ended up losing out to Comcast, which swooped in as a white knight with a surprise offer of its own in February.People familiar with Comcast told Reuters at that time that while it had historically been intrigued by the idea of buying Time Warner Cable, such a deal was not high on its priority list until Charter started pursuing the company.""By going public you could run into the unintended consequence that other people start to think it's important for them and they go after it,"" said a second industry banker.

45,"   By Ronald Grover  Rupert Murdoch's plan to buy Time Warner would help the Twenty-First Century Fox chairman make larger inroads in China, a fast-growing market that media moguls are finding hard to crack.Time Warner's board rejected Murdoch's $80 billion offer, but the Fox chairman is expected to continue the chase. A deal would create a giant with more than $37 billion a year in revenues in the United States and Canada. It would also nearly double the revenues Fox generates from the emerging media markets in Latin America and Asia/Pacific.""He sees 3 billion new consumers coming into the market and a rising middle class in China and India, and mobile devices and strong demand for content,"" said Mario Gabelli, the CEO of GAMCO Investors, in an interview with Reuters Insider, ""He's going to be able to create Netflixes of his own.""Gabelli owns shares of both Fox and Time Warner.Last year, Fox generated 42 percent of its revenue outside the United States and Canada. The company's Asian revenues, including those in Japan and China, grew by 40 percent, to $2.1 billion, over two years.Time Warner's collection of cable channels would complement Fox's programming in key territories. In Latin America, where Fox faces off against large local players, Time Warner's Turner unit operates Chilevision, a large broadcaster in Chile, and also shows its TNT entertainment channel, Cartoon Network and locally tailored regional channels such as the kids channel Tooncast.    Turner offers three well-regarded channels in India, POGO, Cartoonito and Toonami, which could help Murdoch's Indian programming behemoth Star India, which broadcasts 44 channels in seven languages.HBO would likely be Fox's big draw in foreign markets. The pay channel, with a history of hit programs such as ""The Sopranos,"" has around 84 million subscribers outside the United States, beaming its shows into more than 70 countries, and sells programming from HBO and Cinemax into 150 countries.  In China, with Time Warner in the fold, Murdoch would be able to focus more squarely on profiting from what movies and TV shows the government allows. In January, he sold Fox's 47 percent stake in Star China TV, which owns three 24-hour Mandarin channels, and in October sold off Fox's remaining stake in Chinese TV company Phoenix Satellite Television. These move come in the face of restrictions on foreign ownership of China media assets.""Murdoch is not unique. The Chinese government says, 'We cannot let these people control our media,'"" said William Yu, an economist at UCLA's Anderson School of Management, who focuses on emerging Asian economies. A Fox spokesman had no comment. In recent earnings calls and conferences, Fox President Chase Carey has stressed the company's strategy of selling off assets it couldn't own.""Long term, I still think that you ultimately want to either own and operate or monetize,"" he said at a UBS media conference in December. Doug Young, a professor at Fudan University Journalism School, cautioned against overestimating the potential in China. ""Taking two studios and combining, you’ll get a company with twice as many growth prospects in China, but in terms of either having many assets in China, it’s just a market for licensing and selling,"" he said.Still, the China potential is alluring. Consulting and audit firm EY estimates revenue from China's media and entertainment industry will reach $138 billion by 2015, from $59 billion in 2010. The country already has embraced streaming video and EY sees advertising revenue jumping.Its mobile web users, the most in the world, are expected to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.Currently, China limits to 34 the total number of movies foreign companies can import. China's box office last year grew 27 percent, to $3.6 billion, second only to the $10.9 billion million U.S. market. ""Transformers: Age of Extinction,"" a movie distributed by Viacom's Paramount studio, has so far sold more tickets in China than the United States. With its muscular films such as the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" fantasy franchises, Time Warner's Warner Brothers studio gets frequent quota approval. ""China is a great market and we've all wanted to be there for years,"" said former Viacom president Frank Biondi, one of the first U.S. media executives to visit the country. ""But for all the upside, there's the obvious downside that the government controls everything - what gets put into movie theaters, what's put on TV.""A merger would allow Murdoch to use the Warner Brothers studio to claim more quota slots. In 2013, seven Warner Brothers films were granted a release in Chinese theaters, and six for Fox, according to Box Office Mojo. Fox's Hollywood studio last year produced 14 movies, to Warner Brothers' 25 films. Fox has also agreed to co-produce five Chinese language films with Chinese studio Bona Film Group.Warner's movies generated $155.9 million from three of its films that ranked in China's top 20 last year, including ""Gravity"" and ""Man of Steel."" Fox's three films in the top 20, including ""The Wolverine,"" generated $80 million, according to Box Office Mojo. A few of Time Warner's Cartoon Network shows appear on the state-owned China Central Television, and its HBO pay channel provides a five-hour block of programming as well. HBO's offering included a censored version of its fantasy hit ""Game of Thrones"". ""It's a huge opportunity,"" said former Paramount President Sid Ganis, whose Jiaflix company advises movie companies in China, ""and media companies are only now beginning to figure the market out.""(This version of the story says complement instead of compliment in paragraph 7.)

In January, he sold Fox's 47 percent stake in Star China TV, which owns three 24-hour Mandarin channels, and in October sold off Fox's remaining stake in Chinese TV company Phoenix Satellite Television. These move come in the face of restrictions on foreign ownership of China media assets.""Murdoch is not unique. The Chinese government says, 'We cannot let these people control our media,'"" said William Yu, an economist at UCLA's Anderson School of Management, who focuses on emerging Asian economies. A Fox spokesman had no comment. In recent earnings calls and conferences, Fox President Chase Carey has stressed the company's strategy of selling off assets it couldn't own.""Long term, I still think that you ultimately want to either own and operate or monetize,"" he said at a UBS media conference in December. Doug Young, a professor at Fudan University Journalism School, cautioned against overestimating the potential in China. ""Taking two studios and combining, you’ll get a company with twice as many growth prospects in China, but in terms of either having many assets in China, it’s just a market for licensing and selling,"" he said.Still, the China potential is alluring. Consulting and audit firm EY estimates revenue from China's media and entertainment industry will reach $138 billion by 2015, from $59 billion in 2010. The country already has embraced streaming video and EY sees advertising revenue jumping.Its mobile web users, the most in the world, are expected to hit 750 million by 2017, according to data from China-based consultancy iResearch.Currently, China limits to 34 the total number of movies foreign companies can import. China's box office last year grew 27 percent, to $3.6 billion, second only to the $10.9 billion million U.S. market. ""Transformers: Age of Extinction,"" a movie distributed by Viacom's Paramount studio, has so far sold more tickets in China than the United States. With its muscular films such as the ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" fantasy franchises, Time Warner's Warner Brothers studio gets frequent quota approval. ""China is a great market and we've all wanted to be there for years,"" said former Viacom president Frank Biondi, one of the first U.S. media executives to visit the country. ""But for all the upside, there's the obvious downside that the government controls everything - what gets put into movie theaters, what's put on TV.""A merger would allow Murdoch to use the Warner Brothers studio to claim more quota slots. In 2013, seven Warner Brothers films were granted a release in Chinese theaters, and six for Fox, according to Box Office Mojo. Fox's Hollywood studio last year produced 14 movies, to Warner Brothers' 25 films. Fox has also agreed to co-produce five Chinese language films with Chinese studio Bona Film Group.Warner's movies generated $155.9 million from three of its films that ranked in China's top 20 last year, including ""Gravity"" and ""Man of Steel."" Fox's three films in the top 20, including ""The Wolverine,"" generated $80 million, according to Box Office Mojo. A few of Time Warner's Cartoon Network shows appear on the state-owned China Central Television, and its HBO pay channel provides a five-hour block of programming as well. HBO's offering included a censored version of its fantasy hit ""Game of Thrones"". ""It's a huge opportunity,"" said former Paramount President Sid Ganis, whose Jiaflix company advises movie companies in China, ""and media companies are only now beginning to figure the market out.""(This story corrects in 24th paragraph the number of films Fox produced last year) (Additional reporting by Malathi Nayak, Denny Thomas and Paul Carsten; Editing by Peter Henderson)",2014-07-22,NWSA,"Mon Jul 21, 2014 | 11:04pm EDT",A Fox-Time Warner deal would give Murdoch new heft in China,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-timewarner-fox-international-analysis-idUSKBN0FQ07Z20140722?type=companyNews
47,"   By Ronald Grover , Jennifer Saba and Liana B. Baker | LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK  LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK Chase Carey, Twenty-First Century Fox's (FOXA.O) president and chief operating officer, may be feeling pressure to stay in his job for several more years both from his boss, Rupert Murdoch, and from the company Murdoch is trying to buy, Time Warner Inc (TWX.N).As Murdoch mulls his next step following Time Warner’s rejection of his $80 billion offer, some Time Warner investors say they are concerned about who might succeed the 83-year-old chairman and chief executive. In particular, they're not sure whether Murdoch's sons, James, 41, and Lachlan, 42, are ready to manage the integration challenge. That's where Carey comes in.The 60-year-old New Yorker, who's been working for Murdoch since 1988 and earned a reputation for a no-nonsense leadership style, signed a two-year contract with Fox in June that gives him the option to opt out after 18 months. That's raised concern that two years won't be long enough given the complexity of the deal and the likelihood that it may not close until the end of 2015, if not later.""There is a big push for Carey to stick around to handle the transition if not beyond,"" said one person familiar with Fox's thinking. ""There's no way that after working for 30 years for Rupert and he gets his crowning deal that Carey would bail on him.""The succession issue is important to Time Warner shareholders not only because of concerns about the experience of Murdoch’s sons but also because the way the bid was structured, Time Warner shareholders would have no voting shares: Murdoch controls Fox through a special class of voting stock that is not part of the deal. The deal would be less risky for Time Warner shareholders if Carey were still in the job, said one person familiar with Time Warner.Fox spokesman Nathaniel Brown declined to comment. Time Warner spokesman Keith Cocozza also declined to comment. Carey didn't respond to a request for comment.""The reasons people like Carey is he is decisive, he doesn't use words to create obfuscation, he is very direct and extraordinarily candid for a senior executive,"" said Larry Haverty, a portfolio manager at Gabelli with stakes in Fox and Time Warner.""If I had to pick between James and Chase I would pick Chase,"" Haverty said, if the merger happens. On July 16 Time Warner said it rebuffed an $80 billion bid from Fox, including about $85 per share in cash and non-voting stock.The Murdoch family, including James, is so behind Carey that during the contract negotiations Carey was asked to stay three years, according to two people familiar with the talks. One of those sources said that Carey and James have become close and that James is among his strongest supporters. MEDIA COLOSSUS In March, Murdoch elevated James to co-chief operating officer with Carey. Lachlan returned to the fold after nearly ten years to become non-executive co-chairman of both Fox and News Corp (NWSA.O), the publishing assets that were cleaved off from the entertainment division in a corporate split last year.Investors in both companies view Carey as well equipped to handle the job of combining and managing an entertainment and news colossus that would alter the media landscape. A merger would bring under single management the major movie studios Warner Bros and Twentieth Century Fox, a vast array of broadcast and cable networks that includes Turner Broadcasting System and Fox News, and HBO, one of the most successful pay-TV channels.  ""You are dealing with the necessity to manage globally an enormously (big) empire. I think Chase has done that with a company half the size where James has proved he has led a single business,"" Haverty said, noting that James did an ""outstanding job"" as CEO of British pay-TV provider BSkyB BSY.L, which is 39-percent owned by Fox. ""I think James is eventually going to have enough background to move into Chase's shoes and my guess is he will do very well with that,"" said Haverty.LOYAL LIEUTENANT  Time Warner's board is concerned that the Fox deal will leave its shareholders with no say in the future company, sources familiar with Time Warner told Reuters last week. Time Warner has one class of stock. A merger could be a good leverage point to reshape the leadership.""I do think the big deal here ... is the management and the voting control,"" said Matthew Benkendorf, portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management, which owns about 5.5 million non-voting Fox shares.  ""This is a good chance for everyone to start thinking about this generational change going on.""Carey has been one of Murdoch's most loyal lieutenants. During the height of the phone hacking scandal three years ago at Murdoch's British newspapers, the media mogul once went as far as acknowledging that Carey would replace him as CEO if he suddenly ""went under a bus."" Carey joined what was then News Corp in 1988 serving in a variety of roles including a consulting stint and chief executive of DirecTV DTV.O when Murdoch controlled the satellite operator. Carey stayed with DirecTV after Murdoch sold his stake to Liberty Media's (LMCA.O) John Malone but not for long: he quickly went back work for Murdoch after Peter Chernin, president and COO exited News Corp in 2009. ""You've got Chase Carey... he's very strong across the board,"" said Jason Subotky, partner and portfolio manager at Yacktman Asset Management one of Fox's largest common shareholders. ""He's very disciplined, he's a good operator and a good negotiator. He has experience on both sides of the business, both in content and distribution.""

Fox is expected to use the $7.2 billion proceeds from its partial exit from Europe's pay TV market to fuel its pursuit of Time Warner (TWX.N), which recently rejected Fox's initial $80 billion bid. Some investors expect it to return with a higher offer. Fox announced the sale of its Sky Italian and German pay-TV units to BSkyB in cash and assets on Friday.   Murdoch said in a statement about the Sky deal that Fox's ""number one priority is increasing shareholder value in a disciplined manner"" and ""we will only consider transactions that fully support this objective.""  Fox is signalling to investors it will not go beyond its financial means to buy Time Warner, said Bernstein research analyst Todd Juenger. ""Fox and Time Warner are now both engaged in posturing. Fox is trying to reassure investors that it will not overpay,"" Juenger said. Fox did not signal it would use the proceeds for a major deal. It said in a statement that the Sky transaction improves the liquidity on its balance sheet and will support its key principles including ""the consistent return of capital to shareholders.""  Fox also pledged on Friday to keep up its new share buyback program ""regardless of any potential acquisition or investment activity by the company."" It will unveil its new share buyback program on Aug. 6 when it reports its quarterly results. (Reporting by Liana B.

49,"   By Jon Herskovitz  The publisher of a book at the center of a successful defamation case brought by former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura against the estate of a former Navy SEAL said on Wednesday it would delete the passage about a bar fight that sparked the suit.HarperCollins, a subsidiary of News Corp, said the passage in the best-seller ""American Sniper: The Autobiography of the Most Lethal Sniper in U.S. Military History"" by Chris Kyle would be removed, without offering further details.Ventura, was awarded more than $1.8 million in damages on Tuesday after a federal jury in St Paul, Minnesota, found he had been defamed in the book by Kyle, who said he hit a man who made disparaging remarks about the SEALS. Ventura, who first gained national attention as a professional wrestler with a penchant for feathered boas and finger-wagging boasts, sued Kyle's estate for an undisclosed amount, saying his reputation was left in shambles by the passage. Ventura was not named in the book, but Kyle said later that the man he hit was the former governor. Ventura said he had no recollection of Kyle and was angry that comments critical of the SEALS were attributed to him. Kyle said in a videotaped deposition played for jurors at the trial that he punched Ventura, describing him as loud and belligerent. Kyle was killed in 2013 at a Texas shooting range by a troubled Iraq war veteran.Ventura, a former member of the Naval Special Forces Underwater Demolition/SEAL teams, sued Kyle in 2012, saying the fight never happened.

Top U.S. real estate website operator Zillow Inc (Z.O) bought smaller rival Trulia Inc TRLA.N for $3.5 billion in July.CRT Capital analyst Neil Doshi said the online real estate market remained largely fragmented and there was room for more consolidation.Realtor.com, like Trulia's trulia.com and Zillow's zillow.com, lists properties for sale or rent on behalf of homeowners and agents and gets revenue through subscriptions and advertising.Trulia and Zillow lost a combined $30 million in 2013 while Move had a profit of $574,000. News Corp, which owns the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and newspapers in the UK and Australia, said it would pay $21 per share for Move, a premium of 37 percent to the stock's Monday close.Move shares rose to $20.93 in early trading on the Nasdaq, while News Corp shares were down about 1 percent at $16.67.Australian real estate website REA Group Ltd (REA.AX), which is 61.6 percent owned by News Corp, will take a 20 percent stake in Move for about $200 million, News Corp said.""In addition to boosting Move's subscription, advertising and software services, this acquisition will give News Corp a significant marketing platform for our media assets,"" News Corp CEO Robert Thomson said in a statement. Real estate agents and brokers are expected to spend $14 billion on online advertising in 2014, of which Move is expected to corner about 2 percent, he said on a conference call.Move's market share is likely to grow as more advertising spending moves online in the United States, Thomson said.Move also operates moving.com and seniorhousingnet.com. The company, whose sites are accessible through move.com, reaches about 35 million people monthly, making it the third largest U.S. property website operator.

59,"  (Adds executive comments; updates shares)By Soham Chatterjee and Lehar MaanSept 30 Rupert Murdoch's News Corp will buy Move Inc, the owner of property websites such as realtor.com, for about $950 million to expand its digital marketing business as advertising revenue from its print business dwindles.The deal is the second large acquisition in the online real estate market this year as property website operators struggle to turn rising revenue into consistent profitability.Top U.S. real estate website operator Zillow Inc  bought smaller rival Trulia Inc for $3.5 billion in July.CRT Capital analyst Neil Doshi said the online real estate market remained largely fragmented and there was room for more consolidation.Realtor.com, like Trulia's trulia.com and Zillow's zillow.com, lists properties for sale or rent on behalf of homeowners and agents and gets revenue through subscriptions and advertising. Trulia and Zillow lost a combined $30 million in 2013 while Move had a profit of $574,000.News Corp, which owns the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and newspapers in the UK and Australia, said it would pay $21 per share for Move, a premium of 37 percent to the stock's Monday close.Move shares rose to $20.93 in early trading on the Nasdaq, while News Corp shares were down about 1 percent at $16.67. Australian real estate website REA Group Ltd, which is 61.6 percent owned by News Corp, will take a 20 percent stake in Move for about $200 million, News Corp said.""In addition to boosting Move's subscription, advertising and software services, this acquisition will give News Corp a significant marketing platform for our media assets,"" News Corp CEO Robert Thomson said in a statement.Real estate agents and brokers are expected to spend $14 billion on online advertising in 2014, of which Move is expected to corner about 2 percent, he said on a conference call. Move's market share is likely to grow as more advertising spending moves online in the United States, Thomson said.Move also operates moving.com and seniorhousingnet.com. The company, whose sites are accessible through move.com, reaches about 35 million people monthly, making it the third largest U.S. property website operator.Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos wrote in a note on Sept. 11 that he expected Move's revenue to grow faster in 2015 as the U.S. housing market picks up.News Corp said it would commence a tender offer for Move shares within 10 business days and that it expected the deal to close by the end of the year.Goldman Sachs was News Corp's financial adviser and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP its legal adviser. Morgan Stanley was Move's financial adviser and Cooley LLP its legal adviser.Up to Monday's close, Move shares had risen 4.5 percent since July 24, when reports emerged that Zillow was in talks to buy Trulia.

He was referring to traditional cable packages that ""bundle"" together several channels for one price.Consumers have drastically changed the way they watch television, opting for on-demand content offered by Netflix Inc or Amazon.com Inc that can be viewed on a array of devices from TVs to smartphones to tablets. The shift has prompted several big media companies, notably Time Warner Inc and CBS Corp, to announce products that stream TV programs and movies over the Internet without a cable subscription. Carey said on the call that changing viewing habits ""also means we'll be able to engage the consumer more directly, to create more exciting and valuable experiences.

""We want to make sure we are proactive about forming our own judgments about what kinds of offerings that are additive to our business that exist today.""Also on Tuesday, Fox reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit, helped by growth in its cable network and film studio businesses.The company reported a 12 percent rise in revenue to $7.89 million, which beat analysts' average estimate of $6.25 billion, largely driven by the box-office success of ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" and ""The Fault in Our Stars."" Fox shares rose 1.6 percent to $33.85 after the bell on Tuesday.Revenue from cable networks, the company's largest business, rose 15 percent to $3.23 billion, while filmed entertainment revenue was up 17 percent at $2.48 billion. Revenue at the television division was flat at $1.05 billion, held back by declining advertising revenue tied to weak ratings.

Fox had previously forecast 2016 profit of about $8 billion.""We anticipate the industry trends impacting advertising will be slightly larger than previously expected, as both advertising and viewership continues to migrate to digital platforms,"" Carey said on a conference call with analysts.Viewers have made drastic changes to the way they watch television, opting for on-demand content offered by Netflix Inc or Amazon.com Inc, which can be viewed on a array of devices from TVs to smartphones to tablets. According to Trefis, a research company, ratings have been softer this season for scripted shows on Fox's broadcast network, such as supernatural drama ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""New Girl"", a sitcom starring Zooey Deschanel.Softer ratings will hit advertising revenues, a trend that is likely to be exacerbated by rising programming costs, Trefis said in a report published on Feb. 3. (bit.ly/1xkI2Fy)Fox also joins a growing list of U.S. corporations to be hit by the strengthening of the dollar, which gained nearly 13 percent against a basket of currencies in 2014. Carey said 2016 profit would take a $200 million hit from currency moves in addition to a $250 million hit that the company had already been anticipating.Despite the gloomy outlook, quarterly profit came in ahead of analysts' estimates, helped by higher affiliate and advertising revenue in the company's cable business and the box-office success of ""The Maze Runner"" and ""Gone Girl"".

76,"   By Nadia Damouni and Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Several top investors in Twenty-First Century Fox Inc are pressing for the right to swap their voting shares for ordinary shares, which are trading at an unusual premium, even though the move could hand even more control of the company to Rupert Murdoch, according to people familiar with the matter.Fox's dual-class share structure already gives the 83-year-old media mogul control over 39.7 percent of voting rights, even though he and his family hold only a 12 percent equity stake.Several Fox investors, which collectively own 8 percent of voting rights, have been unhappy about the relative performance of their shares since the company delisted from the Australian stock exchange last May, the people said.Historically, the voting shares had traded at a premium. In the five years before the delisting, the Class B shares, which carry voting rights, traded at an average premium of 6.2 percent over the ordinary Class A shares. But the delisting caused some Australian institutional funds to sell their B shares, which now trade at a 3 percent discount to the A shares.Frustrated with the gap, several top Fox shareholders have met with management in recent months to press for amendments to the company's charter to allow voting shares to be convertible into ordinary shares, according to the people, who requested anonymity as the discussions are private.They said the investors, which include major hedge funds, believe conversion rights would push up the value of the B shares, pointing to CBS Corp and Comcast Corp as examples. The voting shares of both companies can be converted and they trade at a premium to ordinary shares.Some of the Fox investors plan to take their proposals to the next annual general meeting, expected in the fall, said the sources familiar with the matter. Changing Fox's charter would require approval from a majority of shareholders with voting rights. It is unclear how much support there would be for this campaign. A Fox spokesman declined to comment. At least two major institutional investors said they had no desire to convert their shares and lose voting rights. Other shareholders may be wary that conversion would leave Murdoch with an even bigger share of the remaining voting shares. In the past, some pension funds and shareholder proxy advisors have criticized Murdoch's command over his media empire, and pushed to separate his chairman and chief executive roles, among other things.Fox, which owns the Twentieth Century Fox film studio as well as broadcast and cable television networks, was spun off from News Corp in 2013 amid shareholder pressure surrounding the phone hacking scandal involving Murdoch's newspapers in Britain. (News Corp's voting shares are also not convertible into ordinary shares.) Following the split, Fox chose to delist from the Australian stock exchange, in part to cut compliance costs and consolidate trading on the Nasdaq to boost liquidity in the U.S. market.The move forced Australian institutional funds that are not permitted to own foreign-listed securities to wind down their positions in Fox. That process is still going on, and has taken longer than some investors expected, people familiar with the matter said. Adding to the pressure, the voting shares have not so far been accepted on any S&P Dow Jones indices, whereas the ordinary shares have. S&P Dow Jones said the voting shares will be indexed in September, which would open them up to index mutual funds, exchange traded funds and index portfolios - that could help the voting shares rebalance. Fox's ordinary A shares have risen 3.8 percent over the past six months to $33.58, while the voting B shares have gained 2.7 percent to $32.57. The average A share trading volume per day is about 12 million shares, versus the B share volume is 4 million shares. There are 1.4 billion A shares and 800 million B shares. Some top Fox investors are willing to give up their voting rights because Murdoch already holds a controlling stake, the sources said. Even if Murdoch's voting rights increase, these funds believe it would not change the way the business is run. ""Once you own the controlling block that he does, the vote is not worth a terrible lot,"" said one of the sources.As for ordinary shareholders, the prospect of convertibility could be an overhang on the common shares, said Eddie Best, a lawyer specializing in capital markets at Mayer Brown LLP. Class B ""shareholders are unlikely to exercise their conversion rights if they don't have plans to sell,"" he said. As for ordinary shareholders, ""they might not love it but they might not have a choice,"" Best said.

77,"   By Michael Holden | LONDON  LONDON Media mogul Rupert Murdoch and former supermodel Jerry Hall got engaged over the weekend, announcing their plans to tie the knot in a classified ad on Tuesday in the Times newspaper, which is owned by Murdoch's News Corp.The 84-year-old executive chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc and Hall, 59, became engaged in Los Angeles, where they had been attending Hollywood's Golden Globes awards ceremony on Sunday, the London newspaper reported.The three-times-married media tycoon and Hall - who is also a former actress and was the longtime romantic partner of Rolling Stones front man Mick Jagger - began dating last summer after being introduced by one of Murdoch's sisters and his niece while in Australia, the Times said.Murdoch, a native of Melbourne, Australia, and Hall, who hails from Gonzales, Texas, were first photographed together at the Rugby Union World Cup Final in London in October.""They have loved these past months together, are thrilled to be getting married and excited about their future,"" a Murdoch family spokesman told the Times. The announcement, published in the paper's Births, Marriages and Deaths section, read: ""Mr Rupert Murdoch, father of Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan, James, Grace and Chloe Murdoch, and Miss Jerry Hall, mother of Elizabeth, James, Georgia and Gabriel Jagger, are delighted to announce their engagement.""The newspaper did not say whether the couple had announced a date for their nuptials. Murdoch divorced his third wife, Wendi Deng, a former executive at Murdoch-owned Star TV in China, in 2013 after 14 years, saying their marriage had been irretrievably broken. (reut.rs/1OYm3n6)In addition to the Times, Murdoch’s News Corp newspapers include the Wall Street Journal, the New York Post and the Sun in Britain. Murdoch also controls 21st Century Fox,  which owns cable networks like Fox News and movie studios.    Hall was married to Jagger for more than 20 years. However, in divorce proceedings in 1999, the British musician claimed they were never legally married.Before her relationship with Jagger, she had dated British pop star Bryan Ferry, front man of the band Roxy Music. On Twitter on Tuesday, “Jerry Hall” was one of the top-trending terms in Britain after news of the engagement broke. Many Twitter users expressed surprise, calling the Hall-Murdoch pairing an unusual match, and some indulged in snark.“So, Jerry Hall, what first attracted you to billionaire ... No, actually, I still don’t understand it,"" tweeted actor David Schneider (@davidschneider).

78,"   By Anya George Tharakan  Rupert Murdoch's News Corp said rumors about the company's interest in buying microblogging site Twitter Inc or building a stake in it were untrue.Twitter's shares, which rose as much as 14 percent on Wednesday, pared some gains and closed up 4.1 percent at $17.38.The stock rose from a record low after unconfirmed chatter about News Corp's interest in Twitter circulated on Wednesday. The rumors intensified after a CNBC segment, tech website Re/code said.The social media site was evaluated as a takeover target because of the company's shrinking stock price, Re/code said. (on.recode.net/1QeVuHw) In the few months since co-founder Jack Dorsey returned as the chief executive, Twitter has been trying to make the site more engaging. The company said in December it was testing a feature to show ads to people who read tweets without logging in as it tries to monetize non-active users.  ""Twitter inside a larger organization definitely makes theoretical sense, whether its another internet company or a media company,"" Monness, Crespi, Hardt, & Co Inc analyst James Cakmak said.A News Corp spokesman said there was no truth to the rumors.Twitter already has several high-profile investors. Former Microsoft Corp CEO Steve Ballmer reported a 4 percent stake in October, making him the third-biggest shareholder after Twitter co-founder Evan Williams and Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Twitter has been the subject of takeover rumors in the past, including a fake report attributed to Bloomberg that claimed the company had received an offer to be acquired for $31 billion. (reut.rs/1Qn5AIj)Twitter had received bids from Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook Inc, according to reports. Twitter trades at 28.12 times forward earnings, below its peer median of 36.06. Facebook has a PE of 33.08, while LinkedIn Corp's is 52.64, according to Thomson Reuters data.""Even though News Corp denied the rumors, I do think this could help investors potentially see some valuations for the stock,"" Cakmak added. Up to Tuesday's close, the stock had fallen nearly 41 percent since Dorsey was named permanent CEO in October.

""Clearly it's a deal that's been in the works for a while, but it's quite fair to say that the decline in the pound is auspicious in the circumstances,"" Thomson told Reuters after the announcement of the 220 million-pound ($295 million) deal that brings together the publisher of The Sun and The Times newspapers with the sports radio broadcaster.Murdoch said on Tuesday the falling pound made Britain more competitive, Sky News and Times journalist Ed Conway tweeted.
