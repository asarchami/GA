1,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BB-' rating to Crown  Castle International Corp.'s (Crown) proposed $500 million senior unsecured note  offering. Crown has an IDR of 'BB' and the Outlook is Stable.  Crown intends to use the net proceeds from the offering to refinance its  existing $500 million of 7.125% senior unsecured notes due 2019. KEY RATING DRIVERS Crown's ratings are supported by the strong recurring cash flows generated from  its leasing operations, the robust EBITDA margin that should continue to  increase as a result of new lease-up opportunities, and the scale of its tower  portfolio. Crown's primary focus on the U.S. market, compared with seeking  growth in emerging markets, reduces operating risk. These factors lend  considerable stability to cash flows and lead to a lower business risk profile  than most typical corporate credits. A key factor in future revenue and cash flow growth for Crown, as well as the  rest of the tower industry, is the growth in wireless network capacity needed to  meet demand for mobile broadband services. Growth in 4G services will drive  amendment activity and new lease-up revenues from the major operators, leading  to at least midsingle-digit growth prospects for the next couple of years.  Fitch expects Crown to deleverage through a mix of cash flow growth and debt  reduction over the course of 2014. This should improve credit protection  measures back within rating expectations. Fitch projects leverage based on full  year EBITDA to be in the 5.5x to 5.7x range by the end of 2014. Crown materially expanded its tower portfolio in December 2013 when it closed on  the $4.83 billion acquisition of exclusive rights to lease and operate towers  from AT&T, Inc. Approximately $3.95 billion of the transaction was funded by  proceeds from common and preferred equity offerings completed in October 2013,  with the remainder funded by revolver drawings and cash on hand. Incremental  term loans totaling $700 million were then used to repay a portion of the  revolver. Crown has meaningful FCF generation, balance sheet cash, and favorable maturity  schedule relative to available liquidity. Cash, excluding restricted cash, was  $223 million as of Dec. 31, 2013. For the year, FCF was approximately $658  million. Crown spent $568 million on capital during this period with a  significant portion allocated for land purchases, which is discretionary in  nature. CCOC had drawn $374 million on its $1.5 billion senior secured revolving credit  facility as of Dec. 31, 2013. The revolving credit facility matures in November  2018. The financial covenants within the credit agreement include a total net  leverage ratio of 6.0x, and consolidated interest coverage of 2.5x. The  financial leverage covenant has an additional step-down to 5.5x in March 2014.  For 2014, Crown expects adjusted funds from operations of approximately $1.5  billion. Contractual maturities for 2014 and 2015 are $101 million and $100  million, respectively.  Crown converted to a real estate investment trust (REIT) for tax purposes on  Jan. 1, 2014. The company has indicated that the total cash distribution in 2014  will approximate $470 million. Fitch believes the company will have flexibility  to manage its leverage as a REIT over the next several years, as its $2.2  billion net operating loss carry-forwards will allow it to manage required REIT  distributions. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Longer-term, Crown may consider lowering its leverage target, which  could lead to an upgrade. In Fitch's view, if the company operated in the 5.0x  to 5.5x range, an upgrade could be considered. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  Fitch taking a negative rating action include: --If Crown does not deleverage the company below 6x by year-end 2014; or --If Crown makes additional material acquisitions that are debt financed.

2,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 30 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings believes Crown Castle International  Corp.'s (Crown) proposed acquisition of Quanta Fiber Networks, Inc. (Sunesys)  for $1 billion in cash will not affect its current 'BB' Issuer Default Rating or  Positive Rating Outlook.  Crown has agreed to acquire Sunesys, a wholly owned subsidiary of Quanta  Services, Inc., in a transaction expected to close by the end of the year.  Sunesys is a fiber services provider that owns or has rights to nearly 10,000  miles of fiber in major metropolitan areas. The business is expected to generate  approximately $80 million to $85 million of gross margin and incur approximately  $20 million in general and administrative expenses in the first year of Crown's  ownership. Strategically, the acquisition complements Crown's rapidly growing  small cell network business by providing significant additional fiber for small  cell deployments. On a pro forma basis, Crown would own or have access to 16,000  miles of fiber. Fitch believes Crown intends to fund the transaction in a leverage neutral  manner, with the transaction funded at least in part through proceeds from asset  sales or equity financing. Crown is currently exploring the sale of its 77.6%  stake in CCAL, its Australian subsidiary, but no agreement has been announced to  date.  Crown's ratings are supported by the strong recurring cash flows generated from  its leasing operations, the robust EBITDA margin that should continue to  increase over time as a result of new lease-up opportunities, and the scale of  its tower portfolio. Crown's primary focus on the U.S. market, compared with  seeking growth in emerging markets, reduces operating risk. These factors lend  considerable stability to cash flows and lead to a lower business risk profile  than most typical corporate credits. Crown's Rating Outlook is currently Positive, given progress made on  deleveraging following two major acquisitions of towers, or rights to towers,  since the end of 2012. These transactions include the $2.5 billion T-Mobile  transaction in 2012, which was largely debt financed, and the $4.8 billion AT&T  Inc. transaction in 2013, which was primarily financed with equity. Fitch  expects Crown's 2015 gross leverage to be in the low 5x area, which is within  the 'BB+' range of Fitch's expectations for leverage for a tower company with  Crown's business and financial risk profile. In December 2014, Crown began paying out a higher proportion of cash flow to its  shareholders as it increased its distribution to $3.28 per share, or  approximately $1.1 billion annually, from $1.40 per share, or approximately $470  million annually. The payout represents an acceleration relative to previous  expectations but will slow future distribution growth. In addition, the change  reduces the rate at which net operating loss carryforwards are used to manage  required real estate investment trust (REIT) distributions. Crown has meaningful cash generation, balance sheet cash, revolving credit  facility availability and a favorable maturity schedule relative to available  liquidity. Cash, excluding restricted cash, was $240 million as of March 31,  2015. For the latest 12 months (LTM) ended March 31, 2015, FCF after dividends  was approximately $98 million. Crown spent $842 million on capital expenditures  during this period, of which approximately $90 million were sustaining capital  expenditures, with the balance discretionary in nature. CCOC had $1.37 billion available on its $2.23 billion senior secured revolving  credit facility as of March 31, 2015. The revolving credit facility matures in  November 2018. The financial covenants within the credit agreement include a  total net leverage ratio of 5.5x, and consolidated interest coverage of 2.5x.  For 2015, Crown expects adjusted funds from operations of approximately $1.45  billion. Crown's maturity profile is manageable; in 2015, anticipated repayments  for securitized debt are expected under the terms of $250 million of tower  revenue notes and $254 million (face value) of WCP securitized notes. Crown  intends to offer new tower revenue notes to repay certain existing tower notes  and to raise proceeds for general corporate purposes. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: An upgrade is likely in the near term given expectations for gross  leverage to be in the low 5x range by the end of 2015. Negative: Future developments potentially leading to a negative rating action  include an increase in leverage above 6x for a protracted period of time due to  an acquisition funded mostly by debt, or a change in financial policy targeting  higher leverage.

11,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 01 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the Issuer Default Ratings  (IDR) of Crown Castle International Corp. (Crown) and its subsidiaries to 'BBB-'  from 'BB'. In addition, Fitch has upgraded the long-term debt ratings of Crown  and its subsidiaries as listed at the end of this release. The Outlook is  Stable, resolving the previous Positive Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS Crown's ratings reflect the strong recurring cash flows generated from its  leasing operations, the robust EBITDA margins and the scale of its tower  portfolio. A focus on the U.S. market reduces operating risk. These factors lend  considerable stability to cash flows and lead to a lower business risk profile  than most typical corporate credits. Delevering Progress: Crown has made progress on delevering following two major  acquisitions of towers, or rights to towers, since the end of 2012. These  transactions include the $2.5 billion T-Mobile transaction in 2012, which was  largely debt financed, and the $4.8 billion AT&T Inc. transaction in 2013, which  was primarily financed with equity. Fitch expects Crown's 2016 gross leverage to  reach 5.2x on a run-rate basis at the end of the year, which is within Fitch's  expectations for leverage for a 'BBB-' rating for a tower company with Crown's  business and financial risk profile. Higher Distributions: In December 2014, Crown began paying out a higher  proportion of cash flow to its shareholders as it increased its distribution to  $3.28 per share, or approximately $1.1 billion annually, from $1.40 per share,  or approximately $470 million annually. The payout represents an acceleration of  the level of payout relative to previous expectations, but slows future  distribution growth. In addition, the change reduces the rate at which net  operating loss carryforwards are used to manage required real estate investment  trust (REIT) distributions. Portfolio Expansion: In December 2013, Crown acquired exclusive rights to lease  and operate towers from AT&T, Inc. for $4.83 billion. The rights are for a  weighted average lease term of approximately 28 years, and Crown has the option  to purchase the towers at the end of the respective lease term for aggregate  payments of approximately $4.2 billion. The leased towers, plus a small number  acquired outright, comprise approximately 24% of Crown's domestic towers.  Equity Financing: Approximately $3.95 billion of the AT&T transaction was funded  by proceeds from October 2013 common and preferred equity offerings, with the  remainder funded by cash on hand and revolver borrowings (later partly repaid by  incremental term loans totalling $700 million).  Wireless Broadband Growth: A key factor in future revenue and cash flow growth  for Crown and its industry peers is the growth in wireless network capacity  needed to meet demand for mobile broadband services. Growth in 4G data services  will drive amendment activity and new lease-up revenues from the major  operators, leading to at least mid-single-digit growth prospects for the next  couple of years. Crown has also deployed distributed antenna systems, which  should allow it to capture additional share in the small-cell infrastructure  required for scaling 4G networks. Sunesys Acquisition: Crown will acquire Sunesys (a wholly owned subsidiary of  Quanta Services, Inc.), a fiber services provider that owns or has rights to  nearly 10,000 miles of fiber in major metropolitan areas, for $1 billion in a  transaction expected to close by the end of the year. Strategically, the  acquisition complements Crown's rapidly growing small-cell network business,  which Fitch believes is a positive. Crown will fund the transaction in a  leverage-neutral manner through the sale of its Australian subsidiary.  Australian Subsidiary: Crown Castle sold its 77.6% interest in its Australian  subsidiary (CCAL) in May 2015 to a consortium of investors led by Macquarie  Infrastructure and Real Assets for approximately $1.6 billion. After accounting  for its ownership interest, the repayment of intercompany debt and transaction  costs, Crown realized about $1.3 billion in net proceeds and disclosed that the  primary use of cash would be to finance the Sunesys transaction. The sale was  prompted by the receipt of unsolicited offers. CCAL was expected to contribute  approximately $100 million to 2015 adjusted EBITDA.  Maturity Profile: Crown's maturity profile is manageable, with legal maturities  for 2015 of $83 million and 2016 of $125 million, respectively. In May 2015, the  company issued $1 billion of securitized tower revenue notes and used part of  the proceeds for anticipated repayments of previously issued $250 million of  tower revenue notes. The remainder was used for the repayment of other debt. REIT Conversion: Crown converted to a REIT for tax purposes on Jan. 1, 2014. The  company was not required to make an accumulated earnings and profits  distribution in order to convert to a REIT. The company's total cash  distribution in 2015 will approximate $1.1 billion. Fitch believes the company  will have flexibility to manage its leverage as a REIT on a business as usual  basis, since the contractual revenues with escalators provide for natural  delevering over time. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Fitch assumes organic site rental revenue growth will be in the low single  digits (on a GAAP basis) in 2015, with potential improvements resulting from  lower churn in the future. Over the next two to three years, EBITDA margins will  remain relatively stable in the mid- to high-50% range. --Fitch anticipates moderate deleveraging will produce gross debt/EBITDA (last  12-months EBITDA) in the range of 5.2x to 5.4x (as calculated by Fitch) at the  end of 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive Rating Action: An upgrade is not likely within a rating horizon  extending to the end of 2016. Negative Rating Action: Developments potentially leading to a negative rating  action include an increase in leverage above 5.5x for a protracted period of  time due to an acquisition funded mostly by debt, or a change in financial  policy targeting higher leverage. LIQUIDITY Strong Liquidity: Crown has meaningful cash generation, balance sheet cash,  revolving credit facility availability and a favorable maturity schedule  relative to available liquidity. Cash, excluding restricted cash, was $240  million as of March 31, 2015. For the LTM ended March 31, 2015, FCF was  approximately $98 million. Capital expenditures were $842 million on capital  expenditures during this period, of which approximately $90 million were  sustaining capital expenditures, with the balance discretionary in nature. CCOC had drawn $860 million on its $2.23 billion senior secured RCF as of March  31, 2014. The RCF matures in November 2018. The financial covenants within the  credit agreement include a total net leverage ratio of 5.5x, and consolidated  interest coverage of 2.5x.
