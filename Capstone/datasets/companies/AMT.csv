1,"  NEW DELHI, April 21 Indian conglomerate Reliance Industries' telecommunications unit, which holds nationwide 4G permits, has agreed to lease mobile phone masts from infrastructure provider American Tower Corporation's (ATC)  local arm, the companies said in a statement on Monday.Reliance Jio Infocomm's agreement with ATC India Tower Corporation comes after its tower-leasing pacts with local firms Reliance Communications, Bharti Infratel and Viom Networks. Reliance Jio also has an agreement with Bharti Infratel's parent Bharti Airtel to share network. Reliance Jio and ATC India did not give financial details of the agreement. ATC India has 11,000 mobile phone towers in the country, according to the statement. Reliance Industries, controlled by India's richest man, Mukesh Ambani, bought 4G airwaves in a 2010 government sale, but is yet to launch services. It added some airwaves it can use to offer 4G services from an auction this year. Boston-headquartered ATC has 67,000 mobile phone towers across 13 countries, according to the statement.

2,"  * American Tower, Axiata, private equity could eye stake* Viom says exploring IPO on NYSE or LSE* Sources say firm could raise $350 mln* Indian telecom tower firms recovering after 2012 setback   (Adds details on stake sale, banks' names, company valuation, industry context)By Sumeet Chatterjee and Devidutta TripathyApril 28 Viom Networks Ltd, an Indian phone tower operator majority owned by the Tata Group, is looking to raise funds either through a stake sale or an overseas listing that could raise up to $350 million, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.Malaysia's Axiata Group Bhd, U.S.-headquartered tower operator American Tower Corp, which operates in India, and a couple of private equity firms are among the possible bidders for the Viom stake, four sources said.Tata Teleservices Ltd, India's No.7 mobile phone carrier by users, owns about 54 percent of Viom, which operates more than 40,000 mobile phone masts. Indian infrastructure financier SREI Group holds about 18 percent.Four private equity investors including Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC and Oman Investment Fund own the rest of the company. The sources said talks are at a preliminary stage and Viom is yet to decide which route to take for fund raising. A deal, either to sell a stake or list shares in an overseas market, was at least five to six months away, said two of the sources.A mismatch in valuation expectations of the seller and the potential bidders may derail the stake sale process, they said.Viom is exploring an overseas initial public offering either on the New York Stock Exchange or the London Stock Exchange, a  company spokesman said. He did not say how much Viom was looking to raise and if it was mulling bringing in an equity partner.""While, we don't comment on speculation, we can confirm that Viom Networks and its shareholders have engaged international financial advisers to explore options for raising growth capital,"" the Viom spokesman said in a statement.The sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media ahead of a public announcement. An Axiata spokeswoman declined to comment, while American Tower and Tata Teleservices did not respond to requests for comment. Tower companies in India get their revenue from leasing out mobile phone masts to carriers. A 2012 court order to revoke several carriers' permits following a licensing scandal hurt tower companies including Viom.But growth is returning as established carriers expand their 3G and 4G networks. Viom recently landed a deal to lease towers to conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd's yet-to-be launched 4G venture. The Indian unit of Norway's Telenor ASA  is one of Viom's biggest customers.OVERSEAS LISTING  As part of the stake sale terms, both Tata Teleservices, a unit of India's steel-to-software conglomerate Tata Group, and SREI Group are likely to divest some of their shares in Viom, the sources said.""If the process goes through, the successful bidder will be the single largest shareholder in the company,"" a source said. No decision has been taken on how much the two main founders of the company will own after the stake divestment, he said.The Viom spokesman said its advisers had valued the company between 220 billion rupees ($3.63 billion) and 270 billion rupees ($4.45 billion), including debt, and that it would decide on the route to raise capital by end-September.Viom, which had hired a clutch of investment banks in 2010 for an Indian market listing but later put off plans due to subdued investor appetite, has less than 65 billion rupees of debt, the spokesman said.If Viom is able to list shares in an overseas bourse soon, it could become the first Indian company to take that route after the government last year allowed firms to list and raise capital overseas without first being listed on local exchanges.Citigroup Inc and Credit Suisse Group AG are advising Viom for the stake sale process, the sources said. A spokesman for Citigroup in Mumbai and a spokeswoman for Credit Suisse in Hong Kong declined to comment.The company has engaged London-based STJ Advisors, a capital market advisory firm, for exploring the possibility of an IPO, Viom said in the statement. It is likely to hire a few Wall Street banks for this process as well, the sources said.($1 = 60.6550 Indian Rupees)   (Additional reporting by Yantoultra Ngui in Kuala Lumpur; Editing by Mark Potter)",2014-04-28,AMT,"Mon Apr 28, 2014 | 9:39am EDT",UPDATE 1-India's Viom looking at stake sale or overseas IPO to raise funds-sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/viom-netw-stakesale-idUSL3N0NK3XT20140428?type=companyNews
3,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to American  Tower Corporation's (AMT) proposed offering of benchmark-sized senior unsecured  debt due in 2021. Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay outstanding  revolver borrowings, which on a June 30, 2014 adjusted basis totaled  approximately $923 million, and for general corporate purposes. The adjusted  basis includes $140 million borrowed in July 2014. AMT has a Fitch Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB', with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS  The ratings and Outlook reflect Fitch's expectations that AMT remains on the  path to delever to levels established upon its October 2013 acquisition of MIP  Tower Holdings LLC - the parent of Global Tower Partners (GTP) for $4.8 billion  (including assumed debt). Owing to debt level expectations at the end of 2014,  combined with recently increased expectations for EBITDA as a result of  acquisitions in 2013 and 2014 and the continued strong performance of its legacy  tower business, Fitch expects the company to remain on a path to reduce  quarterly run-rate net leverage to approximately 5.0x by the end of 2014 or  early 2015. Fitch believes the May 2014 issuance of the mandatory convertible preferred  stock (net proceeds of approximately $583 million) signals the company's intent  to get back to the high end of its 3x to 5x net leverage target by the end of  2014 or early 2015.  Tower revenues are predictable, and contractual escalators combined with strong  prospects for additional business provide for growth. Revenues are generated  primarily from non-cancellable long-term lease contracts with national wireless  operators, several of which are investment-grade. AMT, and the tower industry as  a whole, are benefiting from wireless carriers expanding their fourth generation  (4G) networks to supply rapidly growing demand for mobile broadband services.  Similar trends are occurring internationally, with wireless data services at an  earlier stage of development than in the U.S.  U.S. wireless consolidation is not expected to have a material effect on AMT's  operations. Revenue growth from continued lease activity (supported by wireless  data growth) and contractual escalators in the U.S market will more than offset  the relatively modest losses that may occur over time due to consolidation.  In Fitch's opinion, AMT has a strong liquidity position supported by its free  cash flow (FCF), cash on hand, and availability on its revolving credit  facilities. Operationally, cash flow generation should remain strong. For the  LTM ending June 30, 2014, FCF (cash provided by operating activities less  capital spending and dividends) was approximately $518 million. As of June 30,  2014, cash on hand approximated $283 million and unused revolver capacity was  approximately $3.2 billion. Of the cash balance, approximately $171 million was  held by foreign subsidiaries. Adjusted for $140 million of borrowing in July  2014, available borrowing capacity was $3.066 billion. AMT has three revolving credit facilities: a $1 billion, 364-day RCF due in  September 2014, a $1 billion RCF due in January 2017, and a $2 billion RCF due  in June 2018. The principal financial covenants limit total debt-to-adjusted  EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) to no more than 6.5x until Sept. 30, 2014  and 6.0x thereafter, and senior secured debt-to-adjusted EBITDA to 3.0x for the  company and its subsidiaries. If debt ratings are below a specified level at the  end of any fiscal quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA expense must be no less  than 2.5x for as long as the ratings are below the specified level. The next  material maturities are in 2015 and total approximately $1.15 billion.  RATING SENSITIVITIES At the current 'BBB' level, Fitch's sensitivities do not currently anticipate  developments with a material likelihood of leading to a rating upgrade.  A negative rating action could occur if: --Operating performance falls short of expectations of at least mid-single-digit  organic growth combined with margin pressure; --2014 acquisitions do not extend the time to reach the target leverage range  from Fitch's initial expectations, as a result, a subsequent, significant  leveraging transaction that delays anticipated delevering could lead to a  downgrade.

American Tower did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Any agreement would have to be approved by the local competition watchdog which could take several months.Telecom Italia directors are scheduled to gather on Friday to review the Italian phone group's strategy options in Latin American market, where it controls wireless operator TIM Participacoes (TIMP3.SA).  Sources on Thursday said Telecom Italia Chief Executive Marco Patuano is expected to propose that the best option for the company's Brazilian mobile business is to pursue an acquisition of rival Oi OIBR.SA, three people familiar with the matter said. After failing to complete a planned deal to sell its Telecom Argentina unit and delays in the disposal of its mobile towers in Italy, the Brazilian towers deal would mark a step forward in the Italian group's plans.

American Tower said in a separate regulatory filing it expected the deal value to be about $1.05 billion, subject to adjustments. The companies expect to close the deal during the first half of 2015, they said.Bharti Airtel, India's top telecommunications company,  entered Africa in 2010 by acquiring loss-making telecoms operations for $9 billion, funded by debt. The Indian company has yet to turn a profit in Africa because the high cost of running the operations eat into margins. Nigeria is Bharti Airtel's biggest market in Africa.The latest deal comes after an agreement to sell more than 3,500 mobile phone masts in six African nations to Eaton Towers, a transaction sources said was worth up to $800 million.

12,"  * Bharti Infratel, Blackstone, Carlyle among likely bidders* American Tower, Providence Equity also potential suitors* Tower unit stake sale to help cut debt at Reliance Comm   (Adds details on Reliance debt, source comments, industry context)By Sumeet Chatterjee and Aman ShahMUMBAI, July 31 India's Reliance Communications  has revived a plan to sell a stake in its tower unit, attracting early interest from U.S. private equity firms as well as sector rivals, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.Reliance Communications, India's fourth-biggest mobile phone carrier, is looking at a valuation of about $4 billion for the unit, which has about 45,000 mobile phone masts, the sources said. The stake sale is key for Reliance Communications, the most-leveraged Indian telecoms carrier with $5.8 billion in net debt as of the end of March. Past efforts to sell a stake in the unit or to take it public failed to go through.This time, private equity firms including Blackstone, Providence Equity Partners and The Carlyle Group have shown an interest in bidding, said the sources, requesting anonymity as the information was not public.From the industry side, American Tower Corp and India's Bharti Infratel Ltd were other potential suitors for the 51 percent stake to be offered in Reliance Infratel, they said. ""We keep evaluating options on an ongoing basis and are open to opportunities provided there is a strategic fit,"" a Bharti group spokesman said in a statement, although he did not specifically confirm possible interest in the unit.A Reliance Communications spokesman declined to comment. The company said in a regulatory filing in May that it was looking to monetise its tower assets by March 2016. Blackstone, Carlyle and American Tower, which has a presence in the Indian market, declined comment. Providence Equity could not be immediately reached for comment.India's mobile phone tower sector, which was hit by a court order in 2012 cancelling the permits of several carriers, is expected to see higher demand and tenancies as operators step up the rollout of networks to meet a surge in data uptake.Domestic tower companies may be interested because of an increase in demand from new carriers such as Reliance Jio Infocomm that are preparing to roll out 4G services, said one of the sources.Another of the sources said Reliance Communications was expected to transfer $1.5 billion of its debt to the tower company on a non-recourse basis after closure of the deal, which is likely in October.The tower unit's parent also expects to get at least $1 billion in net proceeds for the stake, which would be used to pay off its high-cost rupee debt, the source added.

23,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to American  Tower Corporation's (AMT) offering of $1 billion 3.375% senior unsecured notes  due in 2026. Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay outstanding  revolver borrowings on its 2013 credit facility.  As of March 31, 2016, outstanding borrowings on AMT's $2.75 billion credit  facility (2013 Revolver) totalled approximately $1.232 billion on a pro forma  basis. Following first-quarter 2016, total outstanding borrowings on the  company's 2013 Revolver, which matures in 2019, increased $1.2 billion from $32  million. AMT has a Fitch Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB' with a Stable  Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectations that AMT's net leverage is  likely return to 5x or below within a 12-24-month period. Fitch expects AMT's  net leverage to be approximately 5.1x (pro forma for current 2016 acquisitions)  and 4.9x at the end of 2016 and 2017, respectively. Leverage is currently  elevated as a result of AMT's acquisition of rights to certain towers, and some  outright, from Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) in a transaction totalling  approximately $5 billion. The Verizon transaction, combined with other  acquisitions in 2015, elevated leverage. Since September 2013, the company has been on the delevering path on an organic  basis, but has continued to be acquisitive. To support delevering while making  acquisitions, in February 2015 the company issued on a net basis $1.34 billion of mandatory convertible  preferred and $2.44 billion (net) of common stock to fund acquisitions,  including the Verizon transaction. In May 2014 the company issued $583 million  (net) of mandatory convertible preferred stock (both mandatory convertible  preferred stock issues are given 100% equity credit). Stronger than expected  organic growth, as well as acquisition-related EBITDA, and debt repayments have  also enabled the company to remain on its delevering path. AMT's ratings are supported by the financial flexibility provided by its strong  free cash flow (FCF; cash provided by operating activities less capital spending  and dividends) and its high EBITDA margin, which has been consistently above 60%  in recent years. The tower business model translates into strong, sustainable  operating performance and FCF growth, aided by the company's significant scale  and the favorable demand characteristics for wireless services (particularly  data). AMT is expected to continue to post strong FCF, generate mid- to high-single-digit organic core revenue growth and expand organic margins. Tower  revenues are predictable, and growth is provided by contractual escalators  embodied in long-term lease contracts and there are strong prospects for  additional business. The tower industry is benefiting from wireless carriers  heavily investing in fourth generation (4G) networks to meet rapidly growing  demand for mobile broadband services. In the second quarter of 2016, AMT closed its acquisition of a 51% stake in Viom  Networks Limited (Viom), a tower operator in India, for approximately $1.1  billion in cash plus assumed debt. At some point in the future, AMT will  contribute its existing tower portfolio in India to Viom, which Fitch expects  will increase its stake in Viom to above 60%. Fitch believes that growth in both  EBITDA and FCF will allow AMT to fund the acquisition with debt without varying  from its year-end leverage path.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Consolidated revenue grows to just over $5.7 billion, based on expectations  for property revenue to be at the mid-point of company guidance of $5.61  billion. In addition, Fitch has incorporated approximately 3/4 of a year of  revenue from the Viom acquisition and one-half of the year-one property revenue  from the Tanzania acquisition in 2016. In 2017, revenue grows just over 7% based  on the full-year effects of the Viom and Tanzania acquisitions. Thereafter  revenue grows in the 4%-5% range due to contractual escalators and new-business  growth. --EBITDA margins decline slightly in 2016 due to the lower margins associated  with acquired properties. --Capital spending of approximately $750 million in 2016, which increases  moderately through 2018, before declining slightly in 2019. --Cash taxes remain modest, at less than $100 million in 2016 and increase  modestly thereafter. There was a one-time cash tax charge in 2015 of $93 million  related to Global Tower Partners (GTP) taken pursuant to a tax election, as GTP no longer operates as a separate  REIT for state and federal tax purposes. --Moderate stock repurchases as net leverage under 5x is reached, with further  deleveraging arising from EBITDA growth (rather than debt repayment). RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: At the current 'BBB' level, Fitch does not currently anticipate  near-term developments that would likely lead to an upgrade of the rating. A negative rating action could occur if: --Operating performance falls short of expectations of at least mid-single-digit  organic growth combined with margin pressure; --A significant transaction, or share repurchases, results in expectations for  net leverage sustained above 5x for longer than a 18-24 month period. LIQUIDITY In Fitch's opinion, AMT has a strong liquidity position supported by its FCF,  cash on hand, and availability on its revolving credit facilities.  Operationally, cash flow generation should remain strong. For 2015, FCF was  approximately $666 million. As of March 31, 2016, cash on hand was approximately  $336 million, and unused revolver capacity was approximately $2.9 billion ($1.7  billion pro forma for the Viom transaction). Of the cash balance, approximately  $236 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. AMT has two revolving credit facilities (RCFs): a $2 billion facility due in  January 2021 and a $2.75 billion multi-currency RCF due in June 2019. The  maturity dates for both credit facilities were extended by one additional year  in October 2015. The principal financial covenant limits total debt/adjusted  EBITDA (as defined in the agreements) to no more than 6.0x beginning in 2016.  The covenants limit senior secured debt/adjusted EBITDA to 3.0x for the company  and its subsidiaries. If debt ratings are below a specified level at the end of  any fiscal quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to interest expense must be no  less than 2.5x for as long as the ratings are below the specified level. Debt maturities during 2016 and 2017 are nominal. Contact:  Primary Analyst John C. Culver, CFA Senior Director +1-312-368-3216 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

27,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to  American Tower Corporation's (AMT) offering of senior unsecured notes due in  2022 and 2027. Net proceeds from the offering will be used to repay existing  debt, including outstanding revolver borrowings on its 2013 and/or 2014  revolving credit facility as well as term loan borrowings. Proceeds may also be  used for general corporate purposes.  As of June 30, 2016, outstanding borrowings on AMT's revolving credit facilities  and term loan totalled approximately $3.9 billion. AMT has a Fitch Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB' with a Stable Rating Outlook. KEY RATING DRIVERS Strong FCF and Margins: AMT's ratings are supported by the financial flexibility  provided by its strong FCF and its high EBITDA margin, which has been  consistently above 60% in recent years. The tower business model translates into  strong, sustainable operating performance and FCF growth, aided by the company's  significant scale and the favorable demand characteristics for wireless services  (particularly data). Stable Growth Model: AMT is expected to continue to post strong FCF, generate  mid- to high-single-digit organic growth and maintain stable margins. Tower  revenues are predictable, and growth is provided by contractual escalators  embodied in long-term lease contracts and there are strong prospects for  additional business. The tower industry is benefiting from wireless carriers  continued investment in their fourth generation (4G) networks to meet rapidly  growing demand for mobile broadband services. Stable Outlook: Although leverage is elevated, Fitch expects net leverage to  return to 5x or below within a 12-24-month period. Fitch expects AMT's net  leverage to be approximately 5.1x (pro forma for current 2016 acquisitions) and  4.9x at the end of 2016 and 2017, respectively. Leverage is currently elevated  primarily as a result of AMT's acquisition of rights to certain towers, and some  outright purchases, from Verizon Communications Inc. (Verizon) in a transaction  totaling approximately $5 billion.  2016 Acquisition: In the second quarter of 2016, AMT closed its acquisition of a  51% stake in Viom Networks Limited (Viom), a tower operator in India, for  approximately $1.1 billion in cash plus assumed debt. At some point in the  future, AMT will contribute its existing tower portfolio in India to Viom, which  Fitch expects will increase its stake in Viom to above 60%. Fitch believes that  growth in both EBITDA and FCF will allow AMT to fund the acquisition with debt  without varying from its year-end leverage path. Consolidation Risk Manageable: U.S. wireless consolidation, if it were to occur,  would not have a material effect on AMT's operations. Revenue growth from  continued lease activity and contractual escalators in the U.S market would more  than offset the relatively modest losses occurring over time due to  consolidation. International Exposure: Similar wireless service demand trends are occurring  internationally, with wireless data services at an earlier stage of development  than in the U.S. Excluding pass-through revenues, the company's international  operations generated approximately 33% of total property revenues in the second  quarter of 2016.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Consolidated revenue grows to more than $5.7 billion, based on expectations  for property revenue to be at the mid-point of company guidance of $5.66  billion. In addition, Fitch has incorporated approximately 3/4 of a year of  revenue from the Viom acquisition and portion of the year-one property revenue  from the Tanzania acquisition in 2016. In 2017, revenue grows just over 7% based  on the full-year effects of the Viom and Tanzania acquisitions. Thereafter  revenue grows in the 4%-5% range due to contractual escalators and new-business  growth. --EBITDA margins decline slightly in 2016 due to the lower margins associated  with acquired properties. --Capital spending of approximately $750 million in 2016, which increases  moderately through 2018, before declining slightly in 2019. --Cash taxes remain modest, at less than $100 million in 2016 and increase  modestly thereafter.  --Moderate stock repurchases as net leverage under 5x is reached, with further  deleveraging arising from EBITDA growth (rather than debt repayment). RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: At the current 'BBB' level, Fitch does not currently anticipate  near-term developments that could lead to an upgrade of the rating. Negative: A negative rating action could occur if operating performance falls  short of expectations of at least mid-single-digit organic growth combined with  margin pressure, or if a significant transaction, or share repurchases, results  in expectations for net leverage sustained above 5x for longer than an 18-24  month period. LIQUIDITY In Fitch's opinion, AMT has a strong liquidity position supported by its FCF,  cash on hand and availability on its revolving credit facilities. Operationally,  cash flow generation should remain strong. For the LTM ending June 30, 2016, FCF  (cash provided by operating activities less capital spending and dividends) was  approximately $813 million. As of June 30, 2016, cash approximated $410 million  and unused revolver capacity was approximately $2.8 billion. Of the cash  balance, approximately $295 million was held by foreign subsidiaries. AMT has two revolving credit facilities: a $2 billion, multi-currency facility  due in January 2021 and a $2.75 billion revolving credit facility due in June  2019. The principal financial covenants limited total debt/adjusted EBITDA (as  defined in the agreements) to no more than 6.0x. The covenants limit senior  secured debt/adjusted EBITDA to 3.0x for the company and its subsidiaries.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or  in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and  distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to  three days earlier than to print subscribers.
