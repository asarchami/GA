4,"   By Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Super-sized hydraulic fracturing jobs, which use vast amounts of sand to coax more oil and gas from shale, have led to astronomical returns for investors in companies that mine the tiny particles.    The question is whether those super-sized gains can continue.Demand has jumped for the sand used in hydraulic fracturing, which blasts it, along with water, chemicals, into wells to crack rock and release crude oil and natural gas. The increasing practice of ""superfracking"" requires much more sand, and investors have taken notice.Emerge Energy Services LP, a master limited partnership that produces sand for use in hydraulic fracturing, began trading a little more than one year ago at $17 per unit. Today the units trade at about $109.Shares of two other sand miners, U.S. Silica Holdings Inc and Hi Crush Partners LP, have more than doubled in the past year. And Fairmount Minerals Ltd, one of the largest providers of sand to the oil and gas industry, is considering a $1 billion initial public offering, according to sources familiar with the situation.Still, investing in these companies carries risks.A drop in crude prices would slow drilling. And the market for sand itself is opaque, requiring investors to make a leap of faith as contract terms, prices and supply and demand are not fully disclosed. Also, some oil and gas companies, such as EOG Resources Inc, are cutting out the middleman by buying their own sand mines.   At the same time, RBC Capital Markets says U.S. demand for raw frack sand will climb 30 percent from 2013 to 2015.Houston oil and gas company Rice Energy Inc, which operates wells in the eastern United States, says it has benefited from using at least 7 percent more sand than its competitors. ""It's something that we've found really effective to help stimulate the well"" to produce more oil and gas, said Julie Danvers, director of investor relations. MILK MONEY Demand for sand is expected to outpace the number of rigs drilling new wells for the foreseeable future, but valuations for the sand miners are rich. Their enterprise value – market capitalization plus debt – is about 10 times expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. An investor looking for a way to profit indirectly from the fracking boom could buy shares of Martin Marietta Materials Inc, which provides gravel to build roads at frack sites and whose enterprise value is 11.7 times EBITDA.Analysts at Baird Equity Research say Emerge has a good growth outlook but rate its units ""speculative."" ""If you buy (Emerge Energy) here, do not do it with the milk money,"" Baird cautioned in a June 5 note to clients.Not every oil and gas producer is convinced that super-sized sand fracks are needed. Chesapeake Energy Corp Chief Executive Officer Doug Lawler said that while the company was tinkering with the amount of sand it used in some areas, greater quantities do not work on all wells.""With every shale, the reservoir is different,"" Lawler told a shareholder who asked about sand at the company's annual meeting on Friday. Sand miners also face the risk of an energy glut and corresponding drop in oil and gas prices, which could reduce drilling.While crude prices have gotten a substantial lift from worries over violence in Iraq, there is lingering concern that producing oil from shale will leave the domestic market oversupplied. In 2013, U.S. crude production climbed to a 24-year high and is forecast to grow more this year with the help of oil pumped from shale, according to government data.MURKY MARKET  Investors in sand miners must also accept the lack of information available to them.Thomas Dolley, a mineral commodity specialist at the U.S. Geological Survey who tracks the sand market, said the industry was fragmented, and participation in the government's supply and demand surveys was not mandatory, resulting in what may be incomplete data for investors.Because most sand companies are privately held, Dolley tracks sand mine openings through industry contacts and the media, he said.""I would say we could use a little more transparency,"" he said.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' latest producer price index shows frack sand prices in May reached their highest level in more than two years, according to a report from Cowen and Co.But Cowen called the government's data for short-term trends ""unreliable"" because some prices in the sample include transportation costs and others do not.

6,"  (Adds details of settlement, share prices)WASHINGTON, June 26 Martin Marietta Materials Inc must divest an Oklahoma quarry and two Texas rail yards in order to proceed with its proposed $2.7 billion acquisition of Texas Industries Inc, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday.Without the divestiture, the proposed acquisition was likely to result in higher prices for purchasers of aggregate in parts of the Dallas metropolitan area because of a dearth of competition, the DOJ said. Aggregate, a crushed stone produced at quarries or mines, is used in a variety of applications, such as road construction, and for the production of ready-to-mix concrete and asphalt.The DOJ's anti-trust division and the state of Texas on Thursday filed a civil lawsuit to block the proposed transaction, and at the same time filed a proposed settlement to resolve competitive concerns. Among the beneficiaries of the actions will be the Texas Department of Transportation, for whom Martin Marietta and Texas Industries are two of the only three suppliers of aggregate for  road building and other infrastructure projects. Under the proposed consent decree, North Carolina-based Martin Marietta must divest its North Troy aggregate quarry in Mill Creek, Oklahoma, and rail yards in Dallas and Frisco, Texas, to approved buyers.In midday U.S. trading Martin Marietta was down 0.7 percent at $130.00 per share and Texas Industries was down 0.9 percent at $90.800.

9,"  (Adds details)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, Sept 24 Lockheed Martin Corp  said on Thursday that U.S. officials have approved its $9 billion takeover of Black Hawk helicopter maker Sikorsky Aircraft from United Technologies Corp.In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said authorities in Japan and South Korea had also approved the deal, but it was waiting for other regulatory approvals.Multiple sources familiar with the matter said Lockheed was now likely to close the acquisition well before the end of the year, as initially expected.When it announced the deal on July 20, Lockheed said it did not anticipate major hurdles, and expected to close the transaction by late in the fourth quarter of 2015 or early 2016. The regulatory process has moved along more smoothly than expected, said the sources, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly.The U.S. Justice Department led the review, with input from the Pentagon and other federal agencies. The deal must still win regulatory approval from the European Union, China and a host of other countries where one or both companies have business interests.""Things are tracking well,"" said one source.The acquisition would open key foreign markets for Lockheed, which has annual revenues of $45 billion, and already dwarfs its nearest competitors, the defense businesses of Boeing Co  and Northrop Grumman Corp. Lockheed is also reviewing the sale or spinoff of $6 billion in businesses in its Information Systems & Government Services unit.If the Sikorsky deal is approved, Lockheed has said it plans to fold the company into its Mission Systems & Training (MST) operation, creating a division with about $15 billion in annual revenues.The services businesses it plans to keep will also become part of MST.Sikorsky will be Lockheed's largest acquisition since it bought Loral Corp's defense electronics business for $9.1 billion in 1996, and merged with Martin Marietta in 1994 in a $10 billion deal.
