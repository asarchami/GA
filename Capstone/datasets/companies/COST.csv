1,"  By Phil WahbaNEW YORK Jan 9 Many large U.S. retailers slashed their earnings forecasts on Thursday because of steep discounts they offered during the holidays to persuade reluctant consumers.The discounts boosted overall industry sales but hurt profits at many chains, including L Brands Inc, Family Dollar Stores Inc and teen retailer Zumiez Inc. Even retailers that reported big sales gains, like Kay Jewelers parent Signet Jewelers Ltd, were not spared.Fewer store visits and aggressive pricing at the start of the season by big retailers like Amazon.com Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc left many chains with little choice but to offer sweeter deals. Many also had too much holiday merchandise, which was ordered in late spring when retail executives were feeling upbeat.""The discounts needed to be deeper, and they needed to be longer,"" said Joel Bines, managing director of consulting firm AlixPartners.The discounts did result in a stronger-than-expected 2.4 percent increase in December sales at nine retailers tracked by the Thomson Reuters Same-Store Sales Index.Still, L Brands cut its holiday-quarter profit forecast on disappointing December sales at its Victoria Secret and La Senza chains.While L Brands' sales at stores open at least year rose 2 percent last month, Wall Street had been expecting a gain of 3.7 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's shares fell more than 4 percent. Zumiez reported an unexpected drop in same-store sales.Shares of Signet, which is not part of the same-store sales index, were down more than 6 percent even though it reported a 5 percent increase in U.S. same-store sales for the November-December holiday season.Gap Inc reported a lower-than-expected 1 percent increase in comparable sales, hurt by weak business at its Old Navy chain, but the retailer said it was ""comfortable"" its full-year profit would come in at the high end of its own forecast range. Shares rose 2 percent in after hours trading.Sears Holdings, which is not in the same-store sales index, reported dismal holiday results at its namesake and KMart stores. Its shares tumbled after hours. Toys R Us, also not in the index, said same-store sales were up 1.8 percent at its U.S. stores.DEALS, AND MORE DEALS Between Nov. 3 and Jan. 4, eight retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Macy's Inc , increased the number of circulars published by 6 percent and sent 57 percent more promotional e-mails, according to data prepared for Reuters by MarketTrack. Retailers also had to deal with shoppers who were less willing to go into stores: Data firm ShopperTrak this week said foot traffic had dropped 14.6 percent this holiday season.Walgreen Co, whose comparable sales of general merchandise rose 2.5 percent in December, said fewer shoppers had come to its drugstores.Small clothing chain Cato Corp also slashed its profit forecast after reporting poor December sales.Still, some retailers offering staples at low prices fared well. Warehouse club chain Costco Wholesale Corp  reported a 5 percent gain in U.S. same-store sales for December, while Wall Street was expecting only 1 percent.American Eagle Outfitters Inc said comparable sales for November and December fell 7 percent and that it expected its quarterly profit to come in at the bottom of its earlier forecast range of 26 cents to 30 cents per share.Family Dollar's same-store sales fell 3 percent last month.American Eagle and Family Dollar are not part of the same-store sales index.",2014-01-09,COST,"Thu Jan 9, 2014 | 5:18pm EST",UPDATE 3-Discounts slam U.S. retailers' holiday season profits,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-retail-december-idUSL2N0KJ18A20140109?type=companyNews
2,"   By Jeff Mason | WEST MIFFLIN, Pennsylvania  WEST MIFFLIN, Pennsylvania President Barack Obama set in motion a plan to help middle-income Americans save for retirement on Wednesday on a road trip to highlight themes from a State of the Union speech devoted to narrowing the gap between the rich and poor.At events at a U.S. Steel plant near Pittsburgh and earlier at a Costco retail store in outside Washington, Obama made good on his promise in Tuesday's speech to focus on reducing income inequality - with or without the cooperation of Congress.Obama signed a presidential order directing Treasury Secretary Jack Lew to establish a government-backed investment option called myRA that permits people with little to no savings to set aside as little as $5 in payroll deductions.""If you worked hard all your life, you deserve a secure retirement,"" Obama told about 1,500 plant workers.The program seeks to address the problem that Americans have not made proper plans to set aside money for their old age and have neither pensions nor a 401(k) retirement savings plan.The myRA plan is similar to the tax-advantageous Roth Individual Retirement Account, but with investment holdings backed by the U.S. government like savings bonds. The accounts would be available to households earning no more than $191,000 a year.Some Republicans expressed concerns about the go-it-alone strategy Obama adopted on Tuesday night.Asked at a Wall Street Journal breakfast about the president's plans to make changes through executive orders when stymied by Congress, Republican Senator Marco Rubio said they were ""deeply counterproductive to making progress.""""All presidents get frustrated with the congressional branch. This president seems to have an extra frustration with it and reacts to it through unilateral actions that I think are counterproductive and in my opinion in some instances borderline unconstitutional,"" said Rubio, a potential 2016 presidential candidate. At the Costco store in Lanham, Md., flanked by boxes of paper towels and garbage bags, Obama said that in coming weeks he would sign an executive order raising to $10.10 an hour the minimum wage for federal contract workers. But he said Congress must act to raise it for millions of other American workers. The current federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.""If you work hard, you should be able to pay your rent, buy your groceries, look after your kids,"" Obama said at the big-box retail store, whose wage practices he had praised. ""If you put in a hard day's work you deserve decent pay for it.""RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE Obama noted that many state governors had already taken steps to raise the minimum wage in their states. ""While Congress decides whether it's going to raise the minimum wage or not, people outside of Washington are not waiting, and I'm not either,"" he said.Obama's travel had a political motive. He is trying to help Democrats win seats in November's congressional elections by focusing on a popular theme that touches on the economy and income inequality.(For a Reuters graphic on U.S. minimum wage and poverty, see link.reuters.com/nuw46v)Obama's action on the minimum wage will affect only a relatively small number of workers, but it drew praise from members of his Democratic Party who were discouraged by the flawed roll-out of his signature healthcare reform law last fall.""The increase in the minimum wage is a very powerful message. It resonates across the country,"" said Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts. ""I think this will really give some wind to this year's Obama agenda."" Republicans oppose a broad increase in the minimum wage, saying it could cause employers to cut jobs and harm the economy.The president's determination to resort more to executive action follows a year in which his policy proposals failed to gain traction in a divided Congress, in which Republicans control the House of Representatives.Vice President Joe Biden, however, said in television interviews on Wednesday that the president did want to work with Congress and was confident of cooperation in some key areas, including reform of immigration policy.House Republicans plan to discuss immigration during a three-day retreat in Maryland starting on Wednesday but conservatives in the party were wary about moving forward on the issue.""We're ready to work with the Congress,"" Biden told NBC's ""Today"" program. The low public approval rate for the legislature, many of whose members face elections in November, would help motivate them to action, he said.Democrats are trying to reinforce the image of Obama, whose poll numbers are low, as a hero of the middle class, much as he presented himself during the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns.""Raising the minimum wage is not just a matter of fairness or a means of combating inequality; it is also needed to jumpstart our economy,"" the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning Washington think tank, said in a statement.(Additional reporting by Roberta Rampton, Mark Felsenthal, Doina Chiacu and Steve Holland; Graphic by Stephen Culp; Editing by David Storey, Sofina Mirza-Reid and Dan Grebler)",2014-01-29,COST,"Wed Jan 29, 2014 | 4:36pm EST",Obama promotes retirement savings plan on State of Union road trip,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-obama-idUSBREA0S0D320140129?type=companyNews
3,"   By Krista Hughes | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. President Barack Obama's nod to trade in his annual State of the Union address reflects a delicate political dance and leaves the hard work still ahead in convincing a skeptical Congress to get behind free trade deals.Business lobbyists had hoped Obama would explicitly urge lawmakers to back a bill giving the White House authority to negotiate free trade pacts and put them before Congress for an up-or-down vote, without amendments.This so-called ""fast-track authority"" is a litmus test of support for two massive free trade deals currently under negotiation which would create a network of trading nations covering roughly two-thirds of global trade.But in recognition of a tricky political juggling act ahead, Obama stopped short of that mark. He did, however, devote four sentences to the need for trade and trade promotion authority (TPA) to ""protect our workers, protect our environment, and open new markets to new goods stamped 'Made in the USA.'""""There are all kinds of political landmines on both sides of the aisle and in both houses of Congress that have to be overcome,"" said National Association of Manufacturers President Jay Timmons on Wednesday.""The speech is important to set the tone but action is what is most critical, and we are going to have to see if the words are backed up by concrete action by the administration - my sense is yes.""Forging stronger trade links with countries on the Pacific Rim is part of the U.S. administration's move to engage more with Asia, while a tie-up with the European Union seeks to level regulatory differences between the world's biggest economies.But Obama has to walk a fine line in gauging how much he can publicly lobby for fast-track power without misstepping in Congress which must be persuaded to cede some power in order for the administration to seal the deals.Trade is deeply divisive in a country which, although it is the world's second-biggest exporter, has the lowest level of exports for the size of its economy of any Group of 20 developed and emerging powers, except Brazil.Opposition to free trade deals, and by extension fast-track power, comes partly from consumer groups, environmentalists and unions, a power base for Obama's Democrats, many of whom worry about lost jobs and weaker labor and environmental standards.More than 550 lobby groups have written to lawmakers urging them to vote against a TPA bill introduced in the House and Senate and opponents released a poll of 816 voters showing 62 percent were opposed to fast-track power for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).""Trade agreements are no longer just about tariffs and quotas. They are about the food we eat, the air we breathe, the jobs we hold. We cannot abdicate this process to non-elected representatives,"" said Larry Cohen, president of the Communications Workers of America, which co-sponsored the poll. But opposition also comes from some Republicans.Conservative Tea Party groups have launched a campaign urging lawmakers to insist on their right to closely scrutinize free trade deals and avoid giving more power to the president.""I don't trust his decision-making process and the American people should not either,"" Republican Paul Broun told reporters on Tuesday.Business groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, are lobbying hard from the other side.An analysis of Twitter hashtags used about the speech by social media analysis firm Crimson Hexagon showed heavy traffic on trade issues, a sign of how some groups have mobilized supporters against expanding trade deals.NUMBERS GAME The numbers game to be played out in Congress is complicated by the likely departure of TPA advocate and Senate Finance Committee chair Max Baucus, nominated as U.S. ambassador to China, as well as looming mid-term elections. Baucus is co-sponsoring the bill in the Senate with Orrin Hatch, the top Republican on the panel. Dave Camp, the Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, which also has jurisdiction over trade, is doing the honors single-handedly in the House.The whole 435-member House is up for re-election in November, along with 36 of the 100 Senate seats. Both Democrats, who control the Senate, and Republicans, who have the numbers in the House, want to keep what they already have and make gains into the other party's territory.Winning support for a politically unpopular bill just ahead of an election is a tough task for the Obama administration. The job is made tougher by the reticence of many Republicans to hand a Democratic president what may look like a political victory.Obama is relying on U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman, highly regarded for his White House connections and behind-the-scenes negotiating skills, to do the heavy lifting to push a TPA bill through. Froman is on the Hill nearly every day Congress is in session, meeting with Democrats and Republicans about the TPA and the trade agenda, a USTR spokeswoman said.""The reality is that the White House needs to bring in Democratic votes in both chambers of Congress to pass TPA,"" said Eric Shimp, policy adviser at law firm Alston and Bird and a former senior trade official.""Both industry and Congress will now wait to see if the White House legislative affairs shop swings into motion to help USTR Froman make the pitch for TPA. If he's flying solo in these coming weeks, we'll have our answer."" Froman and his staff have their work cut out for them.Senate leader Harry Reid, a Democrat, urged policymakers on Wednesday to go slow. ""Everyone would be well advised just to not push this right now,"" he told reporters.In the House, the top Democrat on the Ways and Means committee, Sander Levin, is mulling an alternative TPA bill, and 151 of the 200-strong House Democratic caucus wrote to Obama in November to say they would oppose TPA. A group of 22 House Republicans made a similar complaint.The New Democrats, a 53-strong body which is more aligned with business and trade than union-backed colleagues from the party's left, could be a more fertile ground for TPA votes.The group plans to introduce a bill early next week to extend until 2020 a program making it easier for workers displaced by trade to get benefits and retraining. The bill would go hand in hand with the TPA and could help win Democrat support, but at the risk of alienating Republicans.Republican Representative Erik Paulsen said the bipartisan Free Trade Working Group was trying to convince fellow lawmakers of the benefits of trade, especially given 90 new members had joined the House since the last batch of trade deals passed.""It's imperative now that we go through this education process once again with these new members,"" he told a lunch organized by the Economic Club of Minnesota. ""We really need to work hard to end the myths surrounding TPA.""As mid-year approaches, U.S. lawmakers will increasingly turn their attention to re-election efforts, meaning the window to pass the TPA is very narrow.If not passed by May or June, the timeline could easily slip into 2015 and further drag on the TPP talks, which involve nations from Japan to New Zealand and Chile. Countries hope to wrap up a deal by April, when Obama plans an Asian trip.""We would welcome the passing of the TPA as soon as possible,"" the Japanese ambassador to the United States, Kenichiro Sasae, told a forum on Wednesday.""Unless the United States has it, people might be worried about what would happen if there is a negotiation result and lots of proposals and changes take place, nobody would be seriously negotiating to find a landing zone.""(Reporting by Krista Hughes, additional reporting by Caren Bohan, Thomas Ferraro, David Brunnstrom and Roberta Rampton; Editing by Nick Zieminski)",2014-01-29,COST,"Wed Jan 29, 2014 | 4:22pm EST",Analysis: Obama's nod to trade leaves tough work ahead in Congress,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-trade-analysis-idUSBREA0S1DM20140129?type=companyNews

Net revenue rose by 2.9 percent compared with the same quarter a year earlier to 11.92 billion pesos.Family-owned Comerci is Mexico's No. 4 supermarket chain by revenue.

19,"  WASHINGTON U.S. wholesale inventories rose more than expected in January, as companies built up stocks of autos and machinery, though sales posted their largest decline in nearly five years.The Commerce Department said on Tuesday wholesale inventories rose 0.6 percent to $521.2 billion after a revised 0.4 percent gain in December.Economists polled by Reuters expected stocks of unsold goods at wholesalers to rise 0.4 percent in January.Inventories are a key component of gross domestic product, and strength in that category added 0.14 percentage point to the economy's annual growth pace in the fourth quarter.Excluding autos, wholesale inventories rose 0.4 percent in January. This component goes into the calculation of GDP. Economists believe the current inventory level is unsustainable and expect the build-up in unsold stocks to eventually reverse.The value of automotive stocks rose 2.2 percent in the first month of the year, while machinery stocks were up 1.3 percent.

20,"   By Lisa Baertlein | LOS ANGELES, March 30  LOS ANGELES, March 30 Kraft Macaroni & Cheese has been a favorite meal for generations of American children, but smaller brands made with more natural ingredients are starting to nibble at its market share, part of a trend that is biting into growth at large U.S. food companies.Zenobia Godschalk, an Atlanta mother of two young boys, stopped buying Kraft's ""mac and cheese"" after reading its complicated ingredient list. Now she buys Annie's organic version in bulk at Costco Wholesale Corp.""I'm fully aware that it is not a health food,"" said Godschalk, of Annie's macaroni and cheese product. ""But the ability to make it just a little bit better, and the color that I can believe comes somewhat naturally is good.""Sales of macaroni and cheese are growing as busy Americans look for convenient and inexpensive meal options and older consumers indulge in the comfort foods of their youth. Kraft Foods Group Inc still dominates the category, but the battle for the hearts and minds of American mac-and-cheese lovers may become a new front in a running war in the $360 billion U.S. packaged food industry.On one side stand established food companies like Kraft, which seem more focused on slashing costs than taking big risks on emerging trends. The challengers are more nimble upstarts catering to rapidly evolving consumer tastes by offering products in the fast-growing ""health and wellness"" category.""Even though individual companies by size are quite small, in aggregate they're more on trend with consumer demand and pose a threat to Big Food over time,"" said Consumer Edge Research analyst Robert Dickerson.Nestle SA's Gerber baby food division and General Mills Inc's Yoplait yogurt business may each offer a cautionary tale for Kraft. Both led their respective categories, but their market shares tumbled in recent years. In Gerber's case, it was the growing popularity of small organic baby-food brands. In Yoplait's, it was the arrival of Chobani Greek yogurt, which has more protein and a thick, creamy texture that struck a chord with consumers.WIDER DISTRIBUTION Kraft dominates the U.S. market for packaged macaroni and cheese, but its share fell to 78 percent this month from 82 percent in March 2010, according to Consumer Edge data. A key rival is Annie's Inc, whose natural and organic foods were once sold only at specialty retailers like Whole Foods Market Inc but are now available at Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Kroger Co and other mass-market grocers.Catering to middle- and low-income consumers can transform brands from niche players to powerhouses.Annie's macaroni and cheese share grew to 7 percent this month from 5 percent in March 2010, according to Consumer Edge.WhiteWave Foods Co's Horizon brand, the No. 1 U.S. organic dairy purveyor by sales, also is coming on strong. Its  new macaroni and cheese already is sold by natural and mainstream grocers. Analysts bet the big-box retailers, which stock Horizon's organic milk and cheeses, will soon follow.Kraft, with net revenue of more than $18 billion last year, has said its macaroni and cheese business generates more than $500 million in annual sales. It also has an organic version, but distribution is limited. Dollar sales for Kraft's macaroni and cheese last year rose more than 1 percent. But because the category grew at a faster rate than Kraft's sales growth, the company's share declined slightly, a spokesman said.Kraft, which also sells Velveeta, Cheez Whiz and Jell-O, is tweaking some items with its more mainstream customers in mind, including adding whole grain and removing artificial colors from some macaroni and cheese products. It also took artificial preservatives out of its Kraft Singles processed cheese.""Consumers (are) seeking more fresh, real foods that are made with simple ingredient lines, and we have to think that this is more than just a premium trend,"" Kraft Chief Executive Tony Vernon said at a recent industry conference in Boca Raton, Florida. ""We are democratizing health and wellness, we are not marketing to the 1 percent."" IS 'BETTER FOR YOU' GOOD ENOUGH? Some experts estimate that health and wellness brands account for roughly 10 percent of overall packaged food sales.Organics and Greek yogurt fall into the category, as well as gluten-free products for special dietary needs.A recent survey from consultancy AlixPartners showed that so-called ""superusers,"" defined as individuals who spend 40 percent or more of their budget in the health and wellness category, are most willing to pay a premium of 10 percent or more for locally-sourced or organic products.Large packaged food companies, under pressure to change from parents and anti-obesity activists including first lady Michelle Obama, have made incremental moves into health and wellness.Like Kraft, they tend to rework existing products to be ""better for you"" by removing fat or sodium, or by adding fiber or vitamins. They have also bought small but successful health and wellness brands that end up accounting for just a tiny slice of overall revenue.Some food industry observers warn that there could be a limit to how long large companies can resist consumers' stepped-up demands for changes.""The food industry is at a tipping point,"" said Stephen Hughes, chief executive of Boulder Brands Inc, which makes Smart Balance spread. Boulder was a pioneer in removing artery-clogging trans fats from its products and is taking out ingredients with genetically modified organisms (GMOs).The industry's big players won't start taking more risks until ""the cost of not changing exceeds the cost of changing,"" Hughes said.

27,"   By Jeffrey Dastin  Average sales growth at 10 U.S. retailers, including Costco Wholesale Corp and Rite Aid Corp, topped expectations in May for a second month in a row as shoppers headed to malls in droves around the Memorial Day weekend, according Thomson Reuters data.Sales at established stores on average rose 4.4 percent in May, higher than the 3.9 percent increase analysts had estimated, according to the Thomson Reuters' same-store sales index.The May increase followed a growth spurt in April, when same-store sales for the group rose 6.4 percent, buoyed by the release of pent-up demand after a harsh winter that had kept many consumers home.Most of the retail group, which excludes giants such as Walmart Stores Inc, Target Corp and Best Buy Co, exceeded or equaled sales growth in May 2013. ""It's not just warm weather,"" said Michael Niemira, chief economist at the International Council of Shopping Centers. ""In comparison, temperatures were nearly identical to last year. Presumably [the change] is more fundamental."" Niemira said he expected sales activity to moderate in June after April and May's robust growth. The data is more evidence that the U.S. economy is picking up momentum after slowing during the winter, when weather was colder than usual in many parts of the country.Costco (COST.O) reported a 6 percent increase, stronger than the 4.8 percent that analysts had expected, and its shares rose more than 1 percent on Thursday. By contrast, apparel retailers were ahead of May forecasts, but their sales growth slowed after a strong April.

32,"   By Courtney Sherwood | PORTLAND Ore.  PORTLAND Ore. An Oregon man has sued Costco for $670,000, claiming store security detained him and broke his leg after he refused to show his receipt when exiting the building.Timothy Walls says in his Multnomah County Circuit Court lawsuit, which was filed last week, that when he tried to leave a Portland Costco store with $102.66 in purchases in January last year, an employee grabbed his shopping cart and told him to present his receipt for inspection.When Walls refused, another Costco employee used a “martial arts type strike” that fractured his leg in multiple locations, according to his civil complaint.Walls’s attorney said Tuesday that the litigation is about much more than the broken leg. “We have, throughout the country, observed big box stores that have implemented policies to check all receipts at the door,” lawyer Clayton Morrison said. “They can have that policy. But if the person refuses to show their receipt, what is lawful for the store? Can they detain you?”Costco could have prohibited Wells from returning to the store, but forcing him to stay with no reason to suspect him of a crime amounted to “unlawful holding,” Morrison said. Costco’s lawyers have declined to discuss the case with the media, but in court filings they said that Walls attacked first.The members-only warehouse box store in its court filings said that Walls refused to show his receipt, then threw an employee against a wall and struck him in the throat after the worker called for a manager to resolve the dispute. Walls’s injuries were “the sole and direct cause of Plaintiff’s own actions,” Costco said in the court papers.Walls is asking for $500,000 for pain and suffering, $150,000 for medical expenses and $20,000 for lost wages, and has requested a jury trial. A trial date has not yet been set.

33,"  Warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp's (COST.O) profit topped analysts' estimates for the first time in five quarters, helped by strong back-to-school sales and higher membership fees.Costco's shares rose as much as 3 percent to a record high of $128.95 on Wednesday.The company's strong results are a bright spot in a retail industry that has struggled to attract customers, who have been curbing spending due to stagnant wages and higher taxes.Costco, which caters to relatively higher-income customers than Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and Target Corp (TGT.N), reported a 7 percent increase in same-store sales, excluding fuel, in the quarter ending Aug. 31. Wealthier U.S. shoppers are likely to drive sales in the holiday season even as retailers slash prices to cope with tighter budgets, analysts have said. Costco said it was running promotions to boost sales and memberships as it heads into the holiday shopping season.Costco, which has 185,000 employees globally, said it did not plan any changes to its healthcare benefits. ""We haven't and aren't going to make major changes like cutting a bunch of people out of it,"" Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on a conference call with analysts.Wal-Mart, the biggest U.S. private sector employer, said on Tuesday it would end benefits for some part-time staff.

39,"   By Nandita Bose | CHICAGO  CHICAGO By selling directly to Chinese consumers on Alibaba's platform, a move announced Tuesday, Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST.O) aims to employ local knowledge and a low-cost structure to avoid missteps that caused even the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N), to stumble.Many global retailers opening in China have struggled to find product mixes and store designs favored by local customers. Besides Wal-Mart, Best Buy (BBY.N), eBay (EBAY.O) and others have fallen short of expectations in one of the fastest-growing consumer markets.Costco's virtual storefront on Alibaba Group Holding's (BABA.N) Tmall is designed to help the warehouse store operator study consumer shopping habits with no brick-and-mortar costs and fewer risks, signaling a new approach to expanding in China. ""This shows Costco has learned from the mistakes made by companies like Wal-Mart and also those who were forced to exit the market like Home Depot (HD.N),"" said Anjee Solanki, national director of retail services at Colliers International.Wal-Mart's China sales in the second quarter grew 1.1 percent, but same-store sales, a key figure, declined 1.6 percent. David Cheesewright, head of Wal-Mart's international division, acknowledged at the company's investor conference Wednesday that China remains tough even after 17 years. ""We are still very much focused on building our foundations,"" he said.Early steps at times have been shaky. Wal-Mart stuck with its big-box format even though Chinese consumers prefer neighborhood stores. And its stores in China, including Sam's Club warehouses, offered few high margin private-label goods until as recently as last year. Even Wal-Mart's ""Everyday Low Prices"" slogan backfired. Chinese consumers equate inexpensive with unsafe and value quality as much as bargain prices, retail consultants said. Supply-chain problems came to a head in January when Wal-Mart recalled its popular ""Five Spice"" donkey meat after tests showed traces of fox meat. The recall followed episodes involving tainted milk and recycled ""gutter oil"" sold as cooking oil in the market.Despite the difficulties, Wal-Mart has become China's third-largest retailer, behind Sun Art Retail Group Ltd and state-backed China Resources Enterprise Ltd, according to consultant Kantar Retail.Wal-Mart has made adjustments, too. Last December it announced plans to boost private-label sales to a 20 percent share within a decade, and Wal-Mart has built its own distribution centers to manage product quality.  ""We've done a lot of work on building trust,"" Cheesewright said. TESTING THE WATERS Costco's decision to partner with Alibaba is designed to bring local credibility to the Issaquah, Washington-based retailer. China-based iResearch in July forecast sales of 2.76 trillion yuan ($446.6 billion) for the year, up 45.8 percent from 2013. Virtual storefronts are a growing business on Tmall, one of the world's fastest-growing business-to-consumer marketplaces, with a 50 percent share in China. Tmall lists more than 100,000 brands, about 2,000 of them foreign-made.   ""Digital storefronts are a powerful tool to help shape what a retailer might want to do with a physical store,"" said Marcie Merriman, executive director of retail strategy and customer engagement at EY.  Costco is opening in China with its well-regarded and high-margin private-label Kirkland brand, which sells everything from men's shirts to laundry detergents, aimed at quality-conscious Chinese consumers. Even so, price competition likely will be fierce with Yihaodian, a website in which Wal-Mart is majority owner. As part of an introductory ""Shopping Spree"" on Tmall, Costco offered four packs of Sensodyne toothpaste at 145 yuan, or $23.68, compared with 109 yuan on Yihaodian. Partnering with Alibaba, a symbol of China's economic maturation, may even provide political benefit, a concern at a time when foreign companies have found themselves jousting with the Chinese government. ""We believe (Costco's) worry has always been that if they got it right in China, and returns exceeded the cost of capital, they would quickly gain a new partner in the Chinese government,"" Janney Capital Markets said in a note. LOGISTICS CONCERNS The tie-up with Alibaba is not without risk. Costco's plan to rely on Tmall warehouses to reduce logistics costs and shorten delivery times may risk creating logistics problems similar to those Wal-Mart has faced. ""Letting Alibaba handle a lot of their supply chain is a good short-term solution,"" said Colliers' Solanki. ""But (product) safety is a big issue with supply chains in China, and that has to be managed well."" Rob Howard, chief executive officer of San Francisco-based local delivery firm Grand Junction, said the Alibaba partnership could put Costco in a system that often favors local players. ""It's more of a cobbled-together, relationship-driven infrastructure,"" he said. ""It's hard for an external person to tap into that effectively, and Alibaba has that all nailed.""

40,"   By Nathan Layne  Martha Franco says she hadn't really noticed the sharp drop in gasoline prices, even though the mother of three is always shuttling the kids around in her SUV. She has been paying closer attention to the soaring cost of meat instead.""Meat and grains. Actually it seems like the price of everything is going up,"" Franco, 30, said following a visit to a Kmart discount store on the outskirts of Chicago, with her two youngest children and a bag of groceries in the shopping cart.Retailers hoping for a lift to the year-end shopping season see promise in gas prices, which last week fell below $3.00 for the first time since 2010. Those savings, along with the effect of lower heating fuel, could amount to more than $2 billion extra per month for consumers, analysts calculate, enough to buy a lot of holiday gifts.Franco's attitude is a reality check on those hopes, though: higher food costs are eating into or eclipsing savings from gasoline, and a $2 billion jump in spending could be a much smaller bump after food inflation is taken into account.""People talk about gasoline prices but you can't look at them in isolation,"" said Craig Johnson, head of consultancy Customer Growth Partners (CGP). ""We think the psychological effect of record food inflation, because it's a bigger part of the family budget, is a key behavioral driver here.""Food prices, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts will rise 2.5 to 3.5 percent this year, is one of the main reasons CGP forecasts holiday spending to rise only 3.4 percent. Most other forecasts call for growth above 4 percent.Johnson estimates higher food prices will likely swipe about $10 billion out of consumer wallets in November and December compared with a year earlier, double the $5 billion boost expected from cheaper gasoline. Food accounts for three times more of household budgets than the amount spent at the pump, and he believes food inflation is currently higher than USDA forecasts, running at a clip of 5 percent. The net impact of lower gas prices versus higher food costs will be felt most by lower income households, which on average  own fewer automobiles, said IHS economist Chris Christopher.Assuming the same amount of gas was bought both years, Christopher estimated consumers saved about $1.6 billion from lower gas prices in October versus the same month last year, while laying out $3.3 billion more on food. ""Remember everyone eats, but not everyone drives a car,"" Christopher said.Fortunately for retailers, the fall in gas prices gathered steam and outstripped food inflation in the last month, leaving consumers with net savings of $760 million in October, compared with September, Christopher said.  The caution about food prices is not universal. Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank, estimated a penny saved at the pump provides a $1 billion boost to consumers and that lower gas prices would have a broad, positive effect on the economy, even accounting for food prices.With gas trading at about 27 cents per gallon lower than last year, that translates into annualized savings of $27 billion.Still, retailers which offer gas, food as well as other items may be the best positioned, according to the companies themselves and analysts.Same store sales results by apparel and teen apparel retailers, especially Gap Inc, were among the biggest disappointments in October, according to Thomson Reuters data, while Costco Wholesale Corp did better than expected. Wal-Mart told investors last month that lower gas prices should help its business. On Thursday, citing fuel prices, Wells Fargo raised its earnings targets for convenience store chains Casey General Stores, The Pantry Inc and CST Brands, all three of which deal in groceries and sell gasoline.""Consumers only have so much money in their budget and when a commodity like fuel goes down in price, it has historically created 'space' for us to compete for a higher spend inside the store,"" a CST official told Reuters. Sears Holdings said that it too could benefit, noting shoppers at its Kmart chain were more sensitive to changes in gasoline and other prices.The fall in gas prices ""will hopefully give them added shopping confidence heading into the holiday season,"" said Imran Jooma, executive vice president of the holding firm.But standing outside the Chicago area Kmart, shopper Franco did not display such confidence.""Everything is so expensive and my husband's salary has not increased,"" she said.

41,"  (Adds CEO comments, background)By Ole MikkelsenCOPENHAGEN Nov 13 William Demant, the world's second-largest hearing aid maker, cut its full-year earnings forecast on Thursday after its products were displaced by rival offerings at one of the biggest U.S. retailers, sending its shares down more than 9 percent.Demant said a deal by global leader Sonova to sell its Phonak-branded devices at hearing aid retail centres run by Costco Wholesale Corp had been won at the expense of its own Bernofon range.The Danish company did not give any third-quarter numbers in its trading update but reduced its guidance for 2014 earning per share growth to between 2 and 7 percent, from 5 to 10 percent.It shares were down 9.1 percent at 418.1 Danish crowns by 1057 GMT, pulling down compatriot GN Store Nord by more than 4 percent amid concerns of increased price competition across the sector. Demant Chief Executive Niels Jacobsen said Sonova's deal had upset many independent hearing aid retailers, forcing Sonova to cut prices to them as well.""That is what put pressure on the prices,"" Jacobsen told Reuters. ""Our options are still to gain market share, but we can see we get lower prices for our products than a year or two ago."" Costco's significance is shown its increasing market share in hearing aids. Analysts at Bernstein Research estimate Costco stores acccount for 10 percent of all devices sold in the U.S. private market.In the third quarter, Demant's growth in sales of units globally was estimated to have exceeded its assumption of a 2 to 4 percent growth in the market overall, the company said. ""Its core business ... is under pressure by competitors like GN Store Nord and Sonova,"" said analyst Michael Jorgensen at brokerage Alm. Brand Markets, who has a ""buy"" rating on the stock. ""William Demant just cannot execute at the same level due to price pressure, especially in the United States.""Demant also said it had calculated one-off losses due to ""inaccuracies"" on its balance sheet related to the acquisition of some 70 to 80 entities in the United States between 2011 and 2013.""Combined with an expected loss on a customer loan in the United States, this leads to a total one-off adjustment of our EBIT in 2014 of around 100 million Danish crowns,"" it said.$1 = 5.9739 Danish crown)   (Editing by Sabina Zawadzki and David Holmes)",2014-11-13,COST,"Thu Nov 13, 2014 | 6:30am EST",UPDATE 2-William Demant shares drop after forecast cut on Costco displacement,http://www.reuters.com//article/william-demant-results-idUSL6N0T31OT20141113?type=companyNews

It also alienated independent shops that were Sonova's traditional outlets and angered its competitors: Danish rival William Demant slashed its full-year targets last week, blaming Sonova's deal with Costco - which accounts for 10 percent of all devices sold in the U.S. private market according to estimates by Bernstein Research.Now the Swiss company looks as though it may also have damaged itself by the Costco deal: Not only is it having to woo back the independent shops that turned their back on its brands following the U.S. partnership, but analysts believe it will now be hard for Sonova to meet its full-year sales targets.Sonova's net profit rose 6.1 percent to 173.6 million Swiss francs ($180.63 million) in the first half, lower than expectations for 183 million francs in a Reuters poll of analysts. It said it still expects full-year sales to grow by 7-9 percent and earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) to increase by 11 to 15 percent in local currencies.But Bernstein Research analyst Lisa Bedell Clive wrote: ""We see no conceivable way that Sonova can hit consensus full-year expectations, and thus we expect earnings downgrades in the coming days.""In a note to investors she rated the stock at underperform with a target of 115 Swiss francs, and also pointed out that Sonova's plan to buy back 500 million Swiss francs ($522 million) of its own shares in the next three years was only half of what Bernstein had expected. By 1321 GMT, Sonova shares had fallen 1.4 percent to 145 francs - investors disappointed also by its announcement that it would only lift its dividend ratio to roughly 40 percent of its earnings from 37 percent""This has been an eye opener for the whole industry that a leading hearing aid maker decided to sell its premium brand via a low cost retail chain,"" said Morten Imsgaard, an analyst with Danish Sydbank.While Siemens, GN Resound, and Demant all sell through CostCo, hearing aid makers have typically reserved their lower-end devices for discounters. Sonova has changed that by selling a premium brand - Phonak - through the discounter, which comes at the expense of independent audiologists and so-called shop in shops, typically found in opticians or pharmacies such as Boots.Sonova, which is also struggling to convince investors it can find success with a new range of hearing aids that connect to mobile phones, said it was debt free and had funds to invest in research and acquisitions.It also said the strong Swiss franc against the U.S. dollar, euro and Canadian dollar shaved 30.2 million francs off first-half sales. It expects this impact to ease in the second half.      (1 US dollar = 0.9611 Swiss franc)   (Reporting By Katharina Bart and Ole Mikkselsen.

52,"   By Koustav Samanta and Vijaykumar Vedala  Crude oil prices are likely to bottom out in the first half of 2015, until a possible slowdown in U.S. shale production counters a supply glut exacerbated by OPEC's decision not to cut output, a Reuters monthly survey showed.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' agreement last month to stand pat on output meant the onus for any supply cutbacks was now on non-OPEC producers, primarily led by U.S. shale oil, analysts said.""Oil prices will be lower, making shale oil production less attractive for investments, which are necessary to keep shale oil production growing,"" Commerzbank's Carsten Fritsch said.Oil is seen recovering in the second half as non-OPEC production responds to lower prices, while demand picks up in the course of the year, the poll showed.The survey of 30 economists and analysts projected Brent to average $74.00 a barrel next year and $80.30 in 2016.The forecast for 2015 is $8.50 below the average projection in the previous Reuters poll. The November poll number was down $11.20 from October, marking the biggest downgrade in average forecasts since the 2008 economic downturn.Brent this month hit five-year lows below $60 a barrel, down almost half from peaks reached in June. Brent has averaged $100.57 so far this year.  Brent was up 74 cents at $62.12 on Monday. U.S. crude was up 66 cents at $57.79 a barrel.""In terms of the floor price, we think $60 per barrel will be the level at which fast-rising U.S. shale oil producers will feel the pinch,"" ANZ analyst Natalie Rampono said.""Supply cuts above this level will be limited to other smaller, high-cost U.S. and Canadian unconventional oil producers. Although we think it will take six to 12 months for these supply cuts to become apparent,"" she added. Some analysts, however, were skeptical whether OPEC's stand would serve as a deterrent to U.S. shale oil producers. ""The lag in oil production response from existing wells from the U.S. suggests that only the marginal oil projects will be discouraged at this stage,"" Vyanne Lai of National Australia Bank said. The poll forecast U.S. light crude would average $68.70 a barrel next year, and $74.90 in 2016. U.S. crude has averaged $93.99 so far in 2014.""Some of the highly leveraged U.S. shale oil producers will face serious trouble. In the long term, OPEC strategy should pay off for OPEC as this strategy should lead to higher oil prices from 2016/17 on,"" Hannes Loacker of Raiffeisen Bank said. Raiffeisen is among the most bullish forecasters, projecting Brent to average $80 a barrel in 2015, and is one of 11 institutions that had participated in the previous poll and retained their outlook since then. Of the 14 banks polled that have cut their forecasts since the previous month's survey, Morgan Stanley slashed its projection by $28 to an average 2015 Brent price of $70. ANZ, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, JBC, LBBW and Deutsche Bank also lowered their North Sea crude forecast for next year by more than $15 per barrel.ABN AMRO had the highest Brent forecast at $85 for 2015, while Nomisma Energia had the lowest at $59 a barrel.Brent's premium to U.S. crude will narrow to $5.30 a barrel in 2015 from $6.68 so far this year and $10.58 in 2013, the poll said.

53,"   By Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler | DUBAI/LONDON  DUBAI/LONDON Saudi Arabia and its Gulf OPEC allies are showing no sign of considering cutting output to boost oil prices, even though they dipped below $50 a barrel this week.OPEC decided against limiting production at its last meeting on Nov 27, despite misgivings from non-Gulf members, after Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the group needed to defend market share against U.S. shale oil and other competing sources.Those misgivings have grown with a slide in oil prices to below half their level in June, hurting the economies of OPEC's smaller producers. Benchmark Brent dipped to $49.66 on Wednesday, its lowest since April 2009, before rising to $51 on Thursday.OPEC has forecast an increasing surplus in 2015, citing rising supplies outside the group and lackluster growth in global demand. But the Gulf members, who account for more than half of OPEC output, are not wavering, arguing lower prices will slow competing supplies, spur economic growth and revive demand.One delegate from a Gulf OPEC member said there was ""no chance"" of a rethink while another referred to the view that non-OPEC producers were to blame for the glut. ""Naimi made it clear: OPEC will not cut alone,"" the second delegate said.OPEC ministers and delegates have blamed non-OPEC producers such as Russia, Mexico and Kazakhstan, as well as U.S. shale and tight oil production, for the oversupply in the market.U.S. oil production has surged from around 5 million barrels per day to reach a near 30-year record of more than 9 million bpd over the past six years, propelled by the sudden emergence of shale oil output from North Dakota to Texas.The OPEC delegates - government officials representing their countries who attend OPEC's meetings - spoke to Reuters after oil's brief fall below $50 on condition of anonymity as they are not authorized to speak publicly on the issue. Officially, OPEC agreed at its November meeting on keeping its output target of 30 million barrels per day (bpd) - a point the U.A.E oil minister reinforced on Wednesday - although African members, as well as Iran and Venezuela, had wanted a reduction.Iran and Algeria have both since called on OPEC to cut output in the face of the slide in oil prices. A delegate from Libya, one of OPEC's four African OPEC members, agreed.""Something should be done by OPEC countries to reinstate its role to stabilize the market, ensuring a fair price for both producers and consumers,"" Samir Kamal, Libya's OPEC governor, told Reuters on Thursday, emphasizing he was not speaking on behalf of the Libyan government.""Or there is no need for it any more, especially if only one country is dictating its strategy while hurting other members.""Venezuela campaigned for supply cuts before the OPEC meeting and is still pushing for action. President Nicolas Maduro has embarked on a tour of OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Iran and Algeria, to lobby for efforts to boost prices. FURTHER PRICE FALL?     Saudi Arabia is by far the biggest OPEC producer, with output at around 9.6 million bpd. This, and Saudi's ability to make up for supply shortages elsewhere given its significant spare capacity, also make it in the view of other members the one with the least to lose from cutting output.Venezuela, Algeria and Iran need oil above $100 to balance their budgets, according to estimates from the IMF and other analysts, higher than the Gulf members who can tolerate lower oil revenues for years. The rift in OPEC could deepen if prices keep falling towards $40 or lower and Saudi Arabia maintains its resistance to output cuts, some delegates say, although it is unclear whether it would have any practical impact. One said if it got as far as $30, ""others will start telling the Saudis: 'then you are at war with me?'.""A further drop looks likely, analysts and traders say. BofA Merrill sees a growing risk of Brent falling to $40, not far from the 2008 low of $36.20 reached before OPEC's last formal output cut prompted a steady revival.The Libyan OPEC governor said he believed oil may fall to $45 in the first 6 months of 2015 but would eventually rise, perhaps averaging $55-$60 in 2015.For now though, there has been no call for an OPEC meeting before the group's next scheduled gathering in June, another delegate said. Other countries see little to gain from calling for one given Saudi Arabia's expected resistance.""It would be up to the Saudis. There is no point in having a meeting unless you plan to do something,"" the delegate said.""These prices are killing us,"" said another non-Gulf OPEC delegate. ""But why are you asking me? Go ask the big guys.""

56,"  COPENHAGEN Feb 9 Danish hearing aid company GN Store Nord has extended a supply agreement with U.S. retailer Costco, removing a major risk to its business model and sending its shares four percent higher.It avoids the fate of rival Danish hearing aid maker William Demant which had to cut its 2014 earnings forecast in November after its products were displaced by rivals in Costco stores.It is especially important as Costco sales of hearing aids have outpaced the market average, analysts said.""Losing the contract would have reduced the sale of GN ReSound hearing aids by six percent,"" Jyske Markets wrote in a note to clients on Monday, following GN Store Nord's  announcement. Bernstein analyst Lisa Bedell Clive said Costco now accounts for around 10 percent of all volumes sold in the U.S. private market.

GN Store Nord shares rose 4.2 percent to 153.20 crowns, having earlier hit their highest level since July 2014. GN Store Nord made waves in the industry last year when it launched a hearing aid it developed with Apple that streams iPhone content directly to the user's ear.Chief Executive Niels Jacobsen of William Demant, the largest hearing aid maker in the world after Swiss-based Sonova , emphasised his company was fighting back with its own new products.""We have faith in our pipeline which we count on to deliver a technological lead,"" he told daily Berlingske on the weekend.

65,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 17 (Fitch) American Express' (AXP, 'A+' Outlook Stable)  decision not to renew its U.S. co-brand relationship with Costco Wholesale  Corporation (Costco, 'A+', Outlook Positive) adds earnings pressure to the  company's existing near-term challenges, according to Fitch Ratings. AXP  currently faces lackluster global economic growth, normalizing credit  performance, elevated regulatory risk, and a strengthening U.S. dollar, among  others.  However, AXP's loss of the Costco relationship does not have an immediate rating  impact given the company's continued strong franchise, spend-centric business  model, leading market position in the payments industry, strong relative credit  performance, consistent profitability, diverse funding base, ample liquidity,  and strong risk-adjusted capitalization.  Fitch had anticipated the possibility of the termination of the U.S. Costco  relationship, given the termination of AXP's co-branding relationship with  Costco Canada last year and heightened competition for co-brand relationships  more broadly. Longer-term rating implications will be influenced by AXP's  ability to defend its franchise and invest and grow other businesses while  maintaining strong relative operating performance over time. Extending the Costco relationship would have likely required substantial  concessions from AXP. Fitch views AXP's decision not to renew such an important  relationship as an understandable outcome when seeking to balance long-term  economic value and short-term results. Although near-term earnings will be  pressured, Fitch believes AXP's strong franchise, spend-centric business model  and leading market position in the payments industry position it well to achieve  its long-term operating performance targets. Last Thursday, AXP announced that its co-brand partnership with Costco U.S.  would not be renewed after it expires on March 31, 2016. The announcement  follows the termination of AXP's co-brand program with Costco Canada and  reflects the company's decision last year to conduct a broader review of its  existing co-brand relationships. As part of its review, the company accelerated  contract renewal discussions with several of its co-brand partners well in  advance of their expiration dates.  Despite the loss of the Costco relationship, AXP has been able to reach new  multi-year agreements with several important co-brand partnerships including  Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. ('BBB', Outlook Stable), Cathay Pacific  and Delta Airlines ('BB', Outlook Positive), which represented AXP's largest  airline co-brand loan portfolio at year-end 2013. AXP's other notable co-brand  programs include relationships with Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., Lowe's  Companies Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp. ('B', Outlook Stable). Last Friday, the  Wall Street Journal reported that AXP and JetBlue were not renewing their  co-brand relationship. However, this has yet to be publicly confirmed by AXP or  JetBlue. AXP expects the loss of the Costco U.S. contract to have a negative impact on  earnings and revenue growth in 2015 and 2016. However, the company reiterated  its long-term earnings per share growth target of between 12% and 15% beginning  in 2017. Fitch believes AXP has a number of other investment opportunities  including within consumer and small business payments, prepaid products, global  network services (GNS) bank partnerships, and new co-brand relationships which  could help offset long-term loss of earnings from the Costco relationship. According to AXP, the Costco U.S. co-brand product accounted for approximately  8% of worldwide billed business in 2014 although approximately 70% of total  spending on the card occurred outside of Costco warehouses. AXP believes the  high spend volume outside of Costco warehouses indicates that these cardmembers  have a strong affinity to the AXP brand as well as Costco. AXP expects to slowly  begin offering these customers new products in order to retain a portion of the  high volume of out of store spending.  Furthermore, the Costco U.S. co-brand portfolio accounted for roughly 20% of  AXP's worldwide loans and 10% of worldwide cards in force. As it relates to  regulatory capital levels, AXP expects the lost earnings to be offset by the  decline in loans.

74,"  (Repeating story for additional subscribers without changes to text)By David HenryNEW YORK, March 5 Citigroup Inc had at least one advantage in its successful bid for the exclusive right to issue credit cards for Costco Wholesale Corp, rivals and tax specialists say: it lost so much money during the financial crisis that it has billions of dollars of tax credits.Citigroup and Costco have not disclosed terms of the deal, and outsiders can only speculate about the reasons Citigroup bid aggressively enough to win the business.But officials at two rival banks said they suspect Citigroup's tax credits allowed it to offer Costco better terms than competitors could. They declined to be identified because the negotiations were confidential.At the end of last year, Citigroup had $49.5 billion in net tax credits, known as ""deferred tax assets."" They are a boon to the bank because they can reduce - or even eliminate - its federal income tax liability. Other banks could pay as much as 35 percent of their U.S. income in federal tax, though many also use tax-reduction strategies that push their rates lower.American Express said last month that it would not renew its deal with Costco because the retailer was demanding terms that were not economic, an indication that the profit margins for anyone taking on the business were likely to be razor thin.""The deferred tax assets would be quite a dramatic advantage,"" said Robert Willens, an independent accounting and taxation consultant. Citigroup, he said, may well have won the deal by being able to offer far better terms to Costco than banks that pay more in taxes. Citigroup responded to questions about its tax advantage in the deal with a written statement: ""As the world's largest issuer of consumer credit cards, Citi has unrivaled scale, expertise and capabilities in servicing our partnerships with industry leaders. Costco brings the opportunity for consumer spending growth - when you add Costco's customer loyalty with increased Visa acceptance, it is a win for all parties.""It declined to comment on whether its tax credits helped in winning the business.In 2014, Citigroup used about $3 billion of deferred tax assets to reduce tax liability. To competitors, the bank's tax credits are an irritant. A big chunk of the bank's deferred tax assets stem from the billions of dollars of losses it generated during the financial crisis. Citigroup was rescued three times by the U.S. government between 2008 and 2009, and one of the rescues threatened to wipe out some of the bank's deferred tax assets. However, the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service - which were concerned about the stability of the banking system - relaxed the rules governing such assets to help Citigroup and other banks during the crisis.The government's tax rules were relaxed again for Citigroup when the United States looked to sell its roughly one-third stake of the company after the crisis, Willens said.In both cases, the bank came close to triggering a 1986 tax rule designed to prevent healthy corporations from avoiding taxes by buying weak companies with large deferred tax assets.""In an odd kind of way, the U.S. government essentially put Citigroup in a more competitive position"" to bid for business like the Costco deal, said Charles Peabody, a veteran bank analyst at Portales Partners, a broker focused on research. The Costco transaction is not without risks for Citigroup, especially in the event of an economic downturn that would cause more cardholders to default on payments. But such deals typically last for five to seven years, so Citigroup will have an out down the road.Citigroup could continue to benefit from its deferred tax assets in bidding for assets in the future, Willens said, and the bank has done so in the past. In 2013, the bank bought a portfolio of about $7 billion of credit card loans to customers of Best Buy Inc.Banks, like all U.S. companies, keep two sets of books, one for financial markets and a second for the Internal Revenue Service. Many of the losses on loans and securities that Citigroup recognized during the financial crisis were reported on the bank's books for investors, but cannot be reported for tax purposes until the loss actually happens. When the loss happens and the bank has enough taxable income, Citigroup gets a tax credit, but until then, the bank keeps a deferred tax asset on its books, to recognize the future benefit.The bank's $50 billion of tax credits expire over several decades starting in 2017.Based on how credit card deals are typically negotiated, Citigroup would have factored a number of considerations into its bid for the Costco portfolio: how generous to make rewards programs for the store's customers, how much of a break it would give the retailer on transaction processing costs and how much revenue it would share with the company from fees for processing transactions when Costco cardholders use their cards outside of the store.Banks have been competing intensely for the right to issue cards with retailers, airlines and hotel companies.  In the next year or so American Airlines  is expected to review its current deal with Citigroup, which issues cards carrying both the bank and the airline's brand.

80,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By Lisa Baertlein and P.J. HuffstutterLOS ANGELES/CHICAGO, March 12 KFC, the world's largest chain of fried chicken restaurants, may face pressure from consumer and environmental groups to change how its poultry are raised after McDonald's Corp said it would switch to chicken raised without human antibiotics.McDonald's will phase out chicken raised with antibiotics that are important to human health over two years to allay concern that use of the drugs in meat production has exacerbated the rise of deadly ""superbugs"" that resist treatment, Reuters reported last week. Within days, retailer Costco Wholesale Corp told Reuters it aims to eliminate the sale of chicken and meat raised with human antibiotics. [ID: nL1N0W731Y]KFC is owned by Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum Brands Inc , which has no publicly stated policy on antibiotic use in the production of meat it buys. Chick-fil-A, another chicken restaurant chain that competes with KFC, says about 20 percent of the chicken it serves is raised without any antibiotics, and that its entire supply chain will be converted by 2019.Both McDonald's and Yum are stepping up efforts to win back younger and wealthier diners lured away by chains such as such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc and Panera Bread Co , which boast antibiotic-free meats and other high-quality ingredients. Yum's KFC restaurants in China two years ago suffered a massive sales hit following local media reports that a few poultry farmers supplying KFC fed excessive levels of antibiotics to their chickens.""The train has left the station,"" Bob Goldin, a food services company consultant at Technomic in Chicago, said of McDonald's influence on U.S. chicken production standards.Yum, which also owns the Taco Bell and Pizza Hut chains, declined to discuss its standards for antibiotic use in meat production. ""The chicken served in our U.S. restaurants is USDA high quality, and free of antibiotics,"" the company said in an emailed response to Reuters queries.The antibiotic-free statement refers to a lack of residue in the meat served at its restaurants and not the practice of delivering antibiotics to chickens before they are slaughtered, said Steven Roach, food safety program director at Food Animal Concerns Trust in Chicago.The U.S. Department of Agriculture has three classifications for poultry, A, B, and C, and doesn't have a ""high quality"" designation for chicken. Poultry rated A is what's typically found at retail, while poultry rated B or C is usually used in further-processed products where the meat is cut up, chopped, or ground, according to a USDA website. NOT PART OF THE CONVERSATION McDonald's told Reuters it worked with a wide range of stakeholders, including environmental group Friends of the Earth, to develop its U.S. chicken guidelines. Yum and its brands have ignored requests for information regarding its antibiotic policy, said Kari Hamerschlag, senior program manager for Friends of the Earth's food and technology program.""They have so far not answered any of our emails or phone calls,"" said Hamerschlag, who is working with other advocacy groups to persuade food companies to change their supplier standards to exclude animals raised with the routine use of antibiotics. By contrast, McDonald's was ""very responsive"" to the groups' requests, she said.Other groups working with Friends of the Earth to cut antibiotics from chickens and other meats include the Natural Resources Defense Council, Consumers Union and the Center for Food Safety. Friends of the Earth said its interest in antibiotics has to do with animal agriculture's connection to the environment and human health. KFC supplier Tyson Foods Inc did not comment. Other U.S. chicken producers that have supplied Yum either declined to comment or could not be reached. It's not known who KFC's biggest supplier is or how many chickens KFC buys a year.In 2012, Chinese media reports about excessive antibiotic use by a few KFC chicken farmers hammered sales there. The country has more than 4,800 KFC restaurants and accounted for nearly half of Yum's 2014 operating profit. In response, Yum dropped some 1,000 small poultry farmers from its supply chain and launched a public relations campaign to reassure diners about the quality and safety of its food.Yum operates separate supply chains in China and United States. While antibiotics have made for big headlines in China, the issue also has surfaced at home.A Reuters investigation last year found that KFC supplier Koch Foods Inc from November 2011 to July 2014 had given some of its flocks antibiotics critical to fighting human infections, even though its website stated otherwise.The Chicago-based chicken producer changed the language on its website after questions from Reuters about its use of virginiamycin, an antibiotic included in a class considered ""highly important"" to fighting infections in humans. At the time, Koch said it has no plans to discontinue the use of virginiamycin, which it says may be used to prevent a common intestinal infection in chicken.Koch did not respond to interview requests for this story.KFC US said at the time that its ""supply partners must adhere to our strict standards and specifications, which in some cases are more stringent than the FDA's regulations."" It declined to comment this week.(Editing by Michele Gershberg and John Pickering)",2015-03-12,COST,"Thu Mar 12, 2015 | 7:00am EDT",RPT - INSIGHT-KFC faces pressure after McDonald's says no antibiotics in chicken,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-antibiotics-yum-idUSL1N0WD2X520150312?type=companyNews

The company declined to disclose other terms and said details of how the cards will work for customers will be announced closer to the their expected offering early next year.If the arrangement tracks one that American Express has had with brokerage Morgan Stanley since 2012, the companies will offer both charge cards, which customers would pay off monthly, and credit cards, on which they can carry balances. Competition among card companies has heated up in recent years as issuers have offered richer rewards to customers for their spending and as retailers and airlines have demanded better terms for access to their customers in co-branded deals.American Express said in February it was ending a 16-year deal with Costco because it could not reach renewal terms with the retailer that would make ""economic sense.""

August Brent fell 69 cents to settle at $63.95.The weak July Brent expiration also signalled ""a much over-supplied North Sea trade that is seeing the impact of near record OPEC production both directly and indirectly,"" Jim Ritterbusch, analyst at Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois, said in a research note.U.S. July crude fell 44 cents to settle at $59.52, after trading from $58.73 to $59.98.The spread between Brent and U.S. crude shrank to $2.65 a barrel intraday, the narrowest since January. A month ago it was more than $7 a barrel. Brent has fallen from a high above $66 last week and appeared to be settling in a range between $60 and $65, said Carsten Fritsch, senior oil and commodities analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt.    Global stock markets fell on Monday after talks between Greece and its creditors collapsed on Sunday. [MKTS/GLOB]The euro recovered from earlier weakness. The dollar's intraday strength had weighed on oil futures as a strong dollar makes dollar-denominated oil more expensive for consumers using other currencies. United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon launched Yemen peace talks in Geneva with a call for a humanitarian truce after warplanes from a Saudi-led Arab coalition pounded the capital Sanaa.U.S. industrial production unexpectedly fell in May, data released on Monday showed, as a strong dollar and energy spending cuts weighed on manufacturing and mining output. Oil futures felt pressure from concerns about surplus supply with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) pumping about 2 million barrels per day (bpd) more than needed, according to most industry estimates. Output is increasing in Libya, where production has been constrained by civil war.Production has risen in Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and a deal on Iran's nuclear program could lead to sanctions being lifted, allowing Tehran to increase exports.""Sentiment this morning gets a bearish touch from negative equities, a dollar to the strong side, Greek concerns and news of some increase in Libya oil production,"" said Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodities analyst at SEB Markets in Oslo.

96,"   By Robert Gibbons | NEW YORK  NEW YORK U.S. crude prices rose on Tuesday as a tropical storm moved ashore in the oil-producing state of Texas, but global oversupply limited gains and pressured Brent futures.Expectations that U.S. crude inventories fell again last week and strong RBOB gasoline futures also lent support.U.S. July crude rose 45 cents to settle at $59.97 a barrel, having swung from $59.42 to $60.37.Brent front-month August crude fell 25 cents to settle at $63.70, off its $64.41 intraday peak and below Brent's 50-day moving average of $64.01.U.S. RBOB gasoline rose 2.54 cents to settle at $2.1245 a gallon, still bolstered by last week's government inventory data showing the bulk of the 2.9 million-barrel drop in the week to June 5 occurred on the East Coast.        RBOB futures extended gains more than two cents in post-settlement trading on Tuesday after industry group American Petroleum Institute reported U.S. gasoline and crude oil inventories both fell 2.9 million barrels last week. [API/S] ""Short of a bearish surprise tomorrow in the EIA gasoline data, such as a build of more than 2 million barrels, we look for nearby gasoline to remain strong,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president at Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a research note.Helping U.S. crude outperform Brent is the expectation that this week's U.S. inventory data will show another draw.U.S. crude stocks are forecast to have fallen 1.7 million barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll of analysts. Gasoline stocks are expected to be down 300,000 barrels.

97,"   By Robert Gibbons | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Brent crude edged up and U.S. crude eased on Wednesday in volatile trading as both contracts trimmed losses after the Federal Reserve left the outlook for interest rate increases uncertain, brokers and analysts said.The Fed said the economy was likely strong enough to support an interest rate increase by the end of the year, although it lowered expectations for 2015 economic growth because of a weak start to the year. [MKTS/GLOB]""The Fed again cited international concerns and the lower growth, opening the door for delaying the expected rate hike and keeping liquidity boosted,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.The dollar index weakened, helping dollar-denominated crude recover.Brent August crude rose 17 cents to settle at $63.87, having swung from $62.60 to $65.47 and ending back below its 50-day moving average of $64.16.U.S. July crude dipped 5 cents to settle at $59.92, having traded from $58.85 to $61.38.     Crude and refined products oil futures turned sharply lower after government data showed a surprise gasoline inventory build last week.Concerns about Greece's debt problems and the potential effect on Europe's demand for petroleum also provided pressure.    U.S. July RBOB gasoline fell 2.40 cents to settle at $2.1005 a gallon. It fell as low as $2.0726 after soaring to $2.1858, the strongest front-month price since November.Gasoline inventories rose unexpectedly and crude oil stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, hub rose for the first time since April, while refinery utilization fell, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday. [EIA/S]     Crude inventories fell by 2.7 million barrels, the EIA said.While the EIA's slip was more than the expected draw of 1.7 million barrels, the drop was less than the 2.9-million-barrel slide reported on Tuesday by industry group American Petroleum Institute (API). [API/S]""The drawdown in crude oil inventories was expected, so its effect is muted, and the rise in Cushing, Oklahoma, inventories diminishes the headline number quite a bit,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York. The EIA showed gasoline stocks rose by 460,000 barrels, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 314,000 barrel drop and in sharp contrast to the fall of 2.9 million barrels reported by the API.        U.S. ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) futures also turned lower on the EIA data, although the inventory build reported was less than expectations and ULSD managed to settle 2.49 cents higher at $1.9098 a gallon.

101,"   By Anthony Esposito | SANTIAGO  SANTIAGO Chile's salmon farmers are using record levels of antibiotics to treat a virulent and pervasive bacteria, driving away some U.S. retailers including Costco Wholesale Corp, which is turning to antibiotic-free Norwegian salmon.The coastal waters of Chile, the world's second-largest producer of salmon, are awash with a bacteria known as SRS, or Piscirickettsiosis. The bacteria causes lesions and haemorrhaging in infected fish, and swells their kidneys and spleens, eventually killing them.Unable to develop an effective vaccine, Chilean farmers have been forced to increase antibiotic use. In 2014, the industry produced around 895,000 tonnes of fish and used 563,200 kilograms (1.2 million pounds) of antibiotics, according to government and industry data. Antibiotic use had risen 25 percent from 2013.  In contrast, Norway, the world's largest salmon producer, produced around 1.3 million tonnes of fish and used 972 kilos of antibiotics in 2013. (Figures for last year were not immediately available)Chilean officials say their salmon is safe and the antibiotics have been approved by U.S. food and drug regulators.Still, amid growing concerns in the U.S. food industry that heavy use of antibiotics in animals can spawn drug-resistant superbugs and endanger human health, Costco told Reuters in April that it would reduce imports of Chilean salmon.""The whole industry is starting to shift,"" said Jeff Lyons, who oversees fresh foods at Costco, the No. 3 U.S. retailer. ""If I was to ask you your biggest concern on produce, you might say pesticides. When we ask people in protein, generally it's going to be hormones or antibiotics.""Costco used to buy 90 percent of the 600,000 pounds of salmon fillet it needs per week from Chile, accounting for about 8.5 percent of Chilean salmon exports to the United States. Costco said it intends to buy 60 percent of its salmon from Norway, cutting Chilean imports to 40 percent.A former executive at a Chilean salmon producer said Costco's move could hurt the local industry's reputation and spur other retailers to follow suit.In recent years, U.S. grocery chains Whole Foods Market Inc and Trader Joe's have gradually phased out Chilean farm salmon in favor of antibiotic-free fish caught in the wild.""This is the beginning of a change in seafood,"" said Tobias Aguirre, the executive director of FishWise, a seafood consultancy that works with retailers such as Safeway [MRWAY.UL] and Target Corp. Target has also eliminated farmed salmon from its shelves.  ""Other retailers will look at their lead and try to better understand why Costco made this move, and I think they will follow,"" Aguirre said.CHILE VS NORWAY To be sure, not every salmon buyer is that worried about antibiotics. Chile exported $4.4 billion (£2.8 billion) worth of salmon in 2014, up 24 percent from the previous year, according to industry group SalmonChile.For some buyers, costs are paramount. Brazil's biggest retailer, GPA SA, which buys some 3.6 million kilograms of Chilean salmon per year, said demand for antibiotic-free fish in the South American giant is small, and the high cost of importing from Norway is a deterrent.""The greatest demand in the Brazilian market is for fresh salmon, purchased, for now, from Chile mainly due to logistics,"" GPA said in an email. Chilean salmon producers said there is no reason for consumers to worry. Farmers do not administer antibiotics for months before harvesting the fish, so any traces of the drugs that remain in the salmon when it reaches consumers are within tolerance levels, they said.""The final product consumers eat has no antibiotics,"" said Ricardo Garcia, chief executive of salmon producer Camanchaca, which reported nearly $500 million in sales last year.""This is only something given to sick fish so they don't die. It's not something preventive,"" he said.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a statement that inspections of Chilean salmon have not found unapproved drug residues this fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, and ""any article of food that appears to be adulterated or misbranded at importation is refused admission"" into the country.GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES PROBLEM  In recent months, the U.S. food industry has taken an increasingly tough stance against antibiotics due to concerns that overuse may diminish their effectiveness in fighting disease in humans. Wal-Mart Stores Inc, for instance, is pressing meat, seafood, dairy and egg suppliers to reduce their use of antibiotics.Speaking in general terms, the FDA said it has ""concerns about the improper use of medically important antibiotics in food products derived from animals, as this practise is one factor that can contribute to antimicrobial resistance in humans.""Antibiotic-resistant strains of the SRS bacteria have emerged in Chile's salmon farms, according to a November 2014 study on the government's National Fisheries website.""The bacteria will respond for a few years to the antibiotics treatment but afterward will become stronger and resistant,"" said Alex Munoz, vice president for South America at the Oceana environmental group in Chile.Salmon producers in Chile say they are aware they should reduce their dependence on antibiotics, but they do not expect a significant change since efforts to find an SRS vaccine have so far been unsuccessful.In Norway, intensive research has produced vaccines against most bacterial infections found in salmon farms.    ""We're faced with a reality in Chile, unlike Norway, where we haven't developed vaccines for the Chilean market, leading us to often correct things with the use of antibiotics,"" said Gerardo Balbontin, chief executive of Blumar, which exports a tenth of its salmon production to Costco.

107,"   By Leslie Gevirtz and Alisa Tang  NEW YORK/BANGKOK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A U.S. lawsuit accusing retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. of knowingly selling frozen prawns linked to a company that uses slave labor was described on Friday as ""entirely without merit"" by Thai seafood supply company CP Food Products.A lawsuit filed in the federal court in San Francisco in California on Wednesday sought a court order to stop Costco from selling prawns without a label stating that slave labor was involved in the farm raised prawns.The claim, citing federal and state rules on labeling and slavery, alleged Costco was aware the prawns bought from its Southeast Asian producers came from a supply chain dependent on ships involved in human trafficking and labor abuses.The exporter, CP Food Products Inc, and its parent company, Thailand's Charoen Pokphand Foods PCL, were also named in the lawsuit that was filed on behalf of California resident Monica Sud, a member of Costco which is run as a warehouse club.CP Foods on Friday said it had received a copy of a complaint filed in California concerning its shrimp business.""CPF believes that it has complied with all applicable laws and regulations, and that the complaint is entirely without merit,"" the company said in a statement. Sud's lawyers are seeking class-action status for the lawsuit, which means if granted it could affect millions of customers in California.Costco, the third largest U.S. retailer, said these allegations over issues in the Thai seafood industry had been well publicized for more than a year.This followed an investigation by Britain's Guardian newspaper into the prawn supply chain that found large numbers of men were bought and held against their will on fishing boats off Thailand used to farm prawns sold in some of the world's leading supermarkets. The investigation found Charoen Pokphand (CP) Foods, the world's largest prawn farmer, was buying fishmeal to feed to its farmed prawns from some suppliers that owned, operated or bought from fishing boats manned with slaves.In response to the allegations of labor violations, CP Foods said in a statement in March that it had ""locked down our supply to 30 by-catch fishmeal suppliers and 380 fishing vessels, for which we have full visibility and traceability on sustainability and social issues"".It said it had also stepped up audits and monitoring of fishmeal suppliers, while the company's fishmeal traceability and audit system underwent third-party verification by an independent auditing firm.

108,"   By Leslie Gevirtz and Alisa Tang  NEW YORK/BANGKOK, Aug 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A U.S. lawsuit accusing retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. of knowingly selling frozen prawns linked to a company that uses slave labor was described on Friday as ""entirely without merit"" by Thai seafood supply company CP Food Products.A lawsuit filed in the federal court in San Francisco in California on Wednesday sought a court order to stop Costco from selling prawns without a label stating that slave labor was involved in the farm raised prawns.The claim, citing federal and state rules on labelling and slavery, alleged Costco was aware the prawns bought from its Southeast Asian producers came from a supply chain dependent on ships involved in human trafficking and labor abuses.The exporter, CP Food Products Inc, and its parent company, Thailand's Charoen Pokphand Foods PCL, were also named in the lawsuit that was filed on behalf of California resident Monica Sud, a member of Costco which is run as a warehouse club.CP Foods on Friday said it had received a copy of a complaint filed in California concerning its shrimp business. ""CPF believes that it has complied with all applicable laws and regulations, and that the complaint is entirely without merit,"" the company said in a statement.Sud's lawyers are seeking class-action status for the lawsuit, which means if granted it could affect millions of customers in California.Costco, the third largest U.S. retailer, said these allegations over issues in the Thai seafood industry had been well publicized for more than a year. This followed an investigation by Britain's Guardian newspaper into the prawn supply chain that found large numbers of men were bought and held against their will on fishing boats off Thailand used to farm prawns sold in some of the world's leading supermarkets.The investigation found Charoen Pokphand (CP) Foods, the world's largest prawn farmer, was buying fishmeal to feed to its farmed prawns from some suppliers that owned, operated or bought from fishing boats manned with slaves. In response to the allegations of labor violations, CP Foods said in a statement in March that it had ""locked down our supply to 30 by-catch fishmeal suppliers and 380 fishing vessels, for which we have full visibility and traceability on sustainability and social issues"".It said it had also stepped up audits and monitoring of fishmeal suppliers, while the company's fishmeal traceability and audit system underwent third-party verification by an independent auditing firm.The U.S. State Department's 2015 Trafficking in Persons Report last month singled out the ""enslavement of fishermen in Southeast Asia"".Costco said it has been working with and would continue to work with various stakeholders, including the Thai government, other retailers, and Thai industry, to address the issues that have surfaced.""In the meantime, all of our customers know that if they are dissatisfied with any purchase from Costco Wholesale they can return the item for a full refund,"" Costco said in a statement.

114,"  (Corrects the reporting day for Costco Wholesale to Tuesday)      WEEKAHEAD  Markets enter a busy week with jobs data, several Federal Reserve speakers and the possibility of more brinksmanship in Washington over a potential government shutdown - though that looks like it will be avoided. Markets were unable to hang onto a rally on Friday that was initially prompted by Janet Yellen's assurance that the Fed will raise rates in 2015, and it suggests an overall ongoing level of concern that we're well into a period of steady, ongoing volatility that won't abate for some time.         Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard give welcome remarks before the Third Annual Community Banking Research and Policy Conference on Wednesday. Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley speaks before the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Liquidity Forum in New York on the same day. On Thursday, Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams speaks on the economic outlook before a Salt Lake Area community leaders event. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren gives welcome and opening remarks before the ""Macroprudential Monetary Policy"" conference on Friday. Other speakers at the event hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston include Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland President Loretta Mester and Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer. Separately, ECB president Mario Draghi speaks on the occasion of the awarding of the Atlantic Council Global Citizens Award in Washington, D.C on Thursday.  The Conference Board on Tuesday issues its index of consumer attitudes for September. Economists project consumer confidence to have slipped to 96, compared with 101.5 last month. The single-family home prices for July is due to be released on the same day. The July's S&P/Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas is expected to have gained 5.2 percent year-over-year, a bit quicker than the 5 percent rate in June. The ADP National Employment Report for September is due to be released on Wednesday. Economists estimate a gain of 195,000 jobs this month. On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management issues its index of national factory activity for September. The index, which reflects the pace of growth of manufacturing sector, is projected to have slipped to 50.6 from 51.1 last month. Nonfarm payrolls on Friday are expected to have gained 203,000 in September.  On Tuesday, warehouse club operator Costco Wholesale Corp is likely to report fourth-quarter sales below analysts average estimate. Quarterly comparable store sales, including fuel and foreign currency impact, shrank for the first time in almost six years in the third quarter. The strength of the U.S. dollar could hurt sales and result in comparable sales falling again, analysts said. The company gets 30 percent of its revenue from outside the United States. However, the company could benefit from higher fuel margins in April like Kroger.  Micron Technology Inc is expected to report fourth-quarter profit below estimates on Thursday. The chipmaker has taken a battering as the prices of chips used in computers fall across the board. Micron makes both dynamic random access memory chips, used mostly in personal computers, and NAND memory chips for storing music, pictures and other data on smartphones, cameras and other mobile devices. But with analysts saying that the sector will get back on its feet only after demand picks up in the first half of 2016, investors and analysts will be looking for any kind of positive commentary on chip prices and inventory. The company was also the subject of a much-scrutinized $23 billion takeover bid from China's Tsinghua Unigroup Ltd.  Business research firm IHS Inc is expected to report higher revenue in the third quarter on Tuesday, helped by growth in its subscription business. The company, which raised its full-year revenue forecast last quarter, has said it would focus on ""larger"" acquisitions, and expanding margins. The company has been looking to its industrials business, the second-biggest revenue contributor, to offset weakness in the energy business.  Surgery Partners Inc's IPO is expected to price on Friday in the $23-$26/share range, valuing the company at up to $1.25 billion. The company will raise about $325 million at the mid-point of the range. The Tennessee-based, H.I.G Capital-owned company operates 94 ambulatory surgery centers and five hospitals in 28 states. Surgery Partners' competitors include Surgical Care Affiliates, AmSurg Corp and United Surgical Partners International, which recently struck a merger deal with Tenet Healthcare Corp.  The main economic event in Canada next week will be the monthly gross domestic product report, with economists forecasting the economy grew 0.2 percent in July. On Wednesday, the data should help underscore expectations by both policymakers and economists that the economy regained momentum in the third quarter. Canada was in a mild recession in the first half of the year as it was hit by the drop in the price of oil, a major export for the country.      ON MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 28  The Commerce Department releases U.S. consumer spending data for August. The figure is estimated to have increased 0.4 percent last month after a 0.3 percent gain in July. Economists also expect the monthly core price index for consumer spending to have risen 0.1 percent. Personal income is forecast to have gained 0.4 percent in August.

118,"  BANGKOK Oct 5 Environmental activist group Greenpeace on Monday urged the world's largest manufacturer of canned tuna, Thai Union Group Pcl, to free its supply chains of destructive fishing practices and alleged labour abuses.It warned Thai Union, which makes the U.S. ""Chicken of the Sea"" brand and counts Wal-Mart and Costco Wholesale Corp among buyers, that the fishing methods it and its suppliers employ have serious environmental impacts and carry reputational risks.The Greenpeace action comes as Thailand faces pressure from the European Union to clean up illegal fishing practices or face a trade ban.It could also jeopardize Thai Union's plan to acquire U.S. rival Bumble Bee, which awaits approval from U.S. antitrust authorities.Greenpeace said it would work to make ""every single customer"" aware of the alleged abuses, until Thai Union took responsibility and demonstrated real leadership. ""We can no longer allow Thai Union Group and its brands around the world, including Chicken of the Sea, to sacrifice the world's oceans and jeopardize workers at sea,"" Greenpeace official Graham Forbes said in a statement.Greenpeace said two fishing methods primarily used by Thai Union result in by-catch, or fish that was not targeted but caught inadvertently, and are often associated with illegal fishing and rights violations.Thai Union, formerly known as Thai Union Frozen Products Pcl, said in a statement it was committed to responsible sourcing and legal compliance to ensure all supply chains were treated with respect and human rights upheld. ""We call on Greenpeace to enter into an open and transparent dialogue with Thai Union so that together we can work towards achieving our shared objectives,"" it said.Thailand, the world's third-largest seafood exporter, was given six months by the EU in April to address issues such as ensuring all fishing vessels were registered, had registered equipment and were fitted with a Vessel Monitoring System. Labour abuses in the Thai fishing industry are well-documented. Since 2014, the United States has put Thailand on the bottom-ranked Tier 3 in its annual Trafficking in Persons report.In its 2015 TIP report the U.S. State Department said some Thai and migrant workers were subjected to forced labour on Thai fishing boats with some remaining at sea for several years or paid very little or were threatened and beaten.The commission will decide in December whether Thailand's seafood exports should be blacklisted.Brussels also warned Taiwan last week that it was not doing enough to tackle illegal fishing.

119,"  At least 19 people in seven states may have been infected by E.  coli after eating rotisserie chicken salad sold at Costco Wholesale Corp's (COST.O) stores, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday.Five people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported, but two individuals developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, a type of kidney failure that can lead to permanent organ damage.The infections have been reported in Montana, Utah, Colorado, California, Missouri, Virginia and Washington, CDC said.The current number of HUS cases is twice what is normally seen with E. coli O157:H7, the pathogen identified in the outbreak, said Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety attorney who represents people sickened by tainted food.""This tells me that the number of ill is likely going to go up because the HUS cases are easier to track,"" Marler said. Fourteen of 16 people bought or ate rotisserie chicken salad from Costco in the week before the illness started, but the ingredient linked to the infection has not been identified, the CDC said.Costco said it stopped selling the chicken salad on Nov. 20, the same day it was notified by federal health officials that it was linked to cases of E. coli, said Craig Wilson, vice president of food safety at Costco. E. coli O157:H7 can cause serious illness and is perhaps most often associated with a 1993 outbreak that killed four children who ate undercooked hamburgers at Jack in the Box restaurants.Costco last year was linked to a salmonella outbreak caused by chicken products it sold in at least nine states. The contaminated chicken was supplied to Costco by California-based Foster Poultry Farms. (reut.rs/1lIcHPf) The current E. coli outbreak at Costco comes days after health officials linked burrito chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N) to more than 40 cases of E. coli O26 food poisoning in six states. No HUS nor deaths have been reported in that case.Costco's shares closed down 1.3 percent at $162.19 after heavy trading on Tuesday and were down slightly more in extended trading.

120,"  (Adds details on E. coli strain)Nov 24 At least 19 people in seven states may have been infected by E.  coli after eating rotisserie chicken salad sold at Costco Wholesale Corp's stores, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday.Five people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported, but two individuals developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, or HUS, a type of kidney failure that can lead to permanent organ damage.The infections have been reported in Montana, Utah, Colorado, California, Missouri, Virginia and Washington, CDC said.The current number of HUS cases is twice what is normally seen with E. coli O157:H7, the pathogen identified in the outbreak, said Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety attorney who represents people sickened by tainted food. ""This tells me that the number of ill is likely going to go up because the HUS cases are easier to track,"" Marler said.Fourteen of 16 people bought or ate rotisserie chicken salad from Costco in the week before the illness started, but the ingredient linked to the infection has not been identified, the CDC said. Costco said it stopped selling the chicken salad on Nov. 20, the same day it was notified by federal health officials that it was linked to cases of E. coli, said Craig Wilson, vice president of food safety at Costco.E. coli O157:H7 can cause serious illness and is perhaps most often associated with a 1993 outbreak that killed four children who ate undercooked hamburgers at Jack in the Box restaurants. Costco last year was linked to a salmonella outbreak caused by chicken products it sold in at least nine states. The contaminated chicken was supplied to Costco by California-based Foster Poultry Farms.

127,"   By Kristen Hays | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Dec 1 Costco Wholesale Corp, which sells some of the cheapest gasoline in the country, says a revised tariff overhaul on the giant Colonial Pipeline would add to its costs of providing gasoline.The warehouse club operator told the Federal Energy Commission in a filing on Tuesday that a new tariff system proposed for the massive artery sending fuel from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the Northeast would leave it scrambling for space on the critical but clogged line.Costco is among a group of companies challenging Colonial's rewrite of tariffs governing how space is allotted to ship barrels of gasoline and distillates on the 5,500-mile (8.851 km) system.Costco, which sells fuel at often steep discounts in order to attract customers to its stores, said Colonial's proposed lottery system leaves too many shippers out, forcing them to find other ways to move barrels.Colonial has been full for about three years and routinely allocates space based on shipper history, or how many barrels shippers regularly move in 72 cycles each year. Those that meet a certain threshold are ""regular"" shippers and qualify for consistent space.Those that do not can currently attain that status by swapping their shipper histories back and forth as needed. The new tariff would largely prohibit that practice, leaving them to try to get a fraction of remaining space via a lottery. Colonial says the change would stop shippers from making history transfers that undercut rewarding shipper loyalty.Costco said it would have to win a lottery pick 75 percent of the time - in 54 of the year's 72 cycles - to meet the threshold to qualify as a regular shipper.Otherwise, Costco would be relegated to buying unused line space from another regular shipper on top of fuel costs and Colonial's transport fees. Line space is a secondary market that emerged as shippers grappled with the full system. Regular shippers that may not need all the space they are allotted in a cycle sell the excess - in pennies per barrel shipped - to others who need it.That allows regular shippers to maintain a consistent allotment without paying a penalty for failing to use it all - and risk Colonial shrinking it.Costco said in the past year it has bought line space to various refiners and suppliers for every gallon it took from a Colonial destination.That puts Costco at a disadvantage to its competitors that are regular shippers that do not have to buy line space, it said.

129,"   By Anjali Athavaley  A U.S. federal agency has yet to identify the source of an E. coli outbreak that sickened at least 19 people in seven states who may have been infected after eating rotisserie chicken salad sold at Costco Wholesale Corp. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration laboratory analysis did not confirm the presence of E. coli in a sample of celery and onion mix collected from a Costco store in Montana, the agency said on Tuesday. The incident is the latest occurrence of E. coli where the source of the outbreak is unknown. Health officials have still not found the cause of an E. coli outbreak at restaurants owned by Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc in nine states.In the Costco outbreak, the celery and onion mix was made by Taylor Farms for use in the salad. In November, Taylor Farms Pacific Inc voluntarily recalled 71 products sold at retailers such as Safeway and Wal-Mart Stores Inc citing ""an abundance of caution"" due to the mix testing positive for E. coli in a sample taken by the Montana Department of Health. The state performed a rapid preliminary test and then sent a partial sample of the celery and onion mix to the FDA, which performed a more accurate test that involves growing a colony of the bacteria. Fourteen of 16 people bought or ate rotisserie chicken salad from Costco in the week before the illness started.Costco shares were little changed at $169 in after-hours trading. Chipotle warned that sales at established restaurants could drop 8 percent to 11 percent for the fourth quarter from a year earlier due to the outbreak. The time between ingesting E. coli bacteria and feeling sick is usually three to four days, but may be as short as one day or as long as 10 days, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms often begin slowly with mild belly pain or non-bloody diarrhea that worsens over several days.

134,"   By Olivia Oran  American Express Co (AXP.N) wants to grow small-business lending to make up for revenue it expects to lose after its credit card partnership with Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) ends this year.    Last week, American Express said it will pay an undisclosed amount to feature its charge cards on Fundera, an online marketplace. AmEx hopes small-business owners will compare loan terms and rates and choose its cards over traditional loans.    The company is bracing for the end of co-branded cards with Costco that accounted for 8 percent of worldwide annual spending on AmEx cards in 2014, and 20 percent of the company's outstanding loans.    The planned end of the partnership in March has been delayed a few months because it has taken more time to move customers to a new card, the Seattle Times reported last week.    To make up for that lost revenue, American Express has focused on small-business loans, where it already has a foothold. It views small-business cards as an area with room to grow in the near term, unlike consumer spending.  In 2014, American Express cards for small businesses funded $190 billion in purchases, up from $122 billion in 2010. The company considers cards an untapped form of small-business funding, because small businesses tend to rely more heavily on cash and traditional loans. Only 10 percent of small-business spending takes place on cards.     At AmEx's investor day last year, management highlighted its small-business loan operation as an area of focus.    ""One of the very most important things we're doing as a company is lending and funding,"" David Rabkin, AmEx’s senior vice president of small-business customer acquisition, said in an interview. ""Putting our cards on Fundera marketplace is part of that.""    The charge cards American Express offers on Fundera, called Open, are designed for companies that need to fund large spot purchases of inventory or raw materials, and can pay off the balance in full each month. The Open cards do not charge interest, but carry an annual fee. Spending limits adjust with usage and payment history.     There may be pain ahead as American Express works to grow small-business lending. The credit-card business has gotten more competitive because banks and card issuers view the loans and transaction fees as a relatively stable source of revenue. Also, consumer spending has slowed despite cheaper gasoline.     American Express shares have fallen 25 percent so far this year. The company plans to cut $1 billion in costs by the end of 2017.

137,"   By Nathan Layne  Sam's Club, the warehouse club unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, is building a team of regional U.S. buyers to bring in more local and organic groceries, a strategy used by rival Costco Wholesale Corp to drive loyalty and attract wealthier customers.Attracting and keeping customers has taken on a new importance for Sam's Club after a 0.5-percent fall in sales at existing stores in the quarter ending in January, the first drop since early 2014. Costco, by comparison, posted rises in each month of the quarter and has outgrown Sam's for years.    Sam's Club has hired a handful of buyers in Dallas and is considering putting teams in up to five other markets, John Furner, chief merchandising officer at Sam's Club, told Reuters. Until now, all of its buyers have worked out of company headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas.Buyers find and purchase the products that end up on the shelf.

138,"   By Nathan Layne  Sam's Club, the warehouse club unit of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, is building a team of regional U.S. buyers to bring in more local and organic groceries, a strategy used by rival Costco Wholesale Corp to drive loyalty and attract wealthier customers.Attracting and keeping customers has taken on a new importance for Sam's Club after a 0.5-percent fall in sales at existing stores in the quarter ending in January, the first drop since early 2014. Costco, by comparison, posted rises in each month of the quarter and has outgrown Sam's for years.    Sam's Club has hired a handful of buyers in Dallas and is considering putting teams in up to five other markets, John Furner, chief merchandising officer at Sam's Club, told Reuters. Until now, all of its buyers have worked out of company headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas.Buyers find and purchase the products that end up on the shelf. Having them closer to local markets will make it easier to forge ties with up-and-coming suppliers of organic, healthy and premium foods, as well as products catering to local tastes, Furner said.""(Such items) end up by default being local products and regional products,"" Furner said in an interview, citing organics, craft beer and ""unique salsas"" as examples of the types of product buyers would look to bring into the club.

139,"   By Lisa Baertlein and Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Kroger Co (KR.N) and Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) both turned in softer-than-expected sales at established stores on Thursday, stoking worries about deflation and U.S. consumer spending.Kroger, which attributed some of the weakness to unusually mild winter weather, warned that lower inflation would cool same-store sales growth this year, sending shares down 7.9 percent to $37.46 in afternoon trading. The timing of this year's Super Bowl also hit sales, executives said.  While shoppers have more disposable income as a result of significantly lower fuel prices, ""economic uncertainty remains, which typically causes people to cut back on discretionary spending,"" Kroger Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said on a conference call with analysts.   The largest supermarket operator in the United States said sales at established stores, referred to as same-store sales, rose 3.7 percent in the quarter, excluding fuel, missing the 4.5 percent rise analysts expected, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.Kroger, owner of the Ralphs, Smith's and Food 4 Less stores, forecast same-store sales growth of 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent for the year ending January 2017, down from 5 percent growth for year earlier. Costco said its same-store sales growth was hurt by lower traffic in January and a strong dollar that dented overseas spending on big-ticket items. Shares in Costco were down 2.1 percent at $149.65.Excluding fuel and foreign exchange impact, same-store sales at Costco rose 5 percent, below the 5.4 percent growth expected by analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix.February traffic was up just over 3.5 percent, while the average transaction fell about 3.75 percent, Costco executives said on a call with analysts. Kroger Chief Financial Officer Mike Schlotman conceded that  volatile prices for staples such as meat, milk and produce are giving certainty-seeking investors heartburn. Still, he warned against concluding that ""less inflation is fundamentally a bad thing.""For example, he said, same-store sales in Kroger's meat department were down 5 percent in the latest quarter. But steep price declines lured back shoppers who had been suffering from sticker shock and the resulting increase in tonnage contributed to Kroger margins.            ""The price of meat went down and the volume went a up lot, which is a sign of a solid, normal consumer environment,"" said BB&T Capital Markets analyst Andrew Wolf. The average value of the dollar against a basket of currencies was 8.2 percent higher in Costco's second quarter compared with the same quarter last year. The company gets about 27 percent of its revenue from outside the United States.Sales at rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) missed market expectations last month, hurt by a strong dollar, declining prices for grocery products and sluggish apparel demand.

153,"  April 18 Costco Wholesale Corp is considering building a poultry-processing plant in Nebraska in a move that would lead to the retailer buying area corn and soybean meal, according to an announcement by a local development council.The facility, if built in Nebraska's Dodge County, would create 1,100 jobs and work with local farmers to provide locally raised poultry, the Greater Fremont Development Council said in a release on its website dated April 14.Costco, the third-largest U.S. retailer, could not immediately be reached for comment. Costco said last year that it was working toward eliminating the sale of chicken and meat from other animals raised with ""shared-use"" antibiotics. It also pledged eventually to procure only chickens raised in cage-free environments.Both moves are part of industry-wide trends that promise to shake up food supply chains. Costco has grown into one of the largest U.S. food retailers and sells more than 80 million rotisserie chickens a year. Costco chose Dodge County, in eastern Nebraska, as a ""preferred site"" to build the facility because of the area's quality workforce, available land, local farmers willing to grow chickens and proximity to customers and suppliers, among other factors, the Greater Fremont Development Council said in the release.Costco plans to buy 300,000 bushels of corn and 3,000 tons of soybean meal each week from local providers, according to the release.

154,"  (Updates with comments from union negotiator, details on the agreement)April 19 Teamsters unions representing 16,000 workers of Costco Wholesale Corp on Tuesday recommended their members approve a new contract offer from the retailer that they said would secure larger pension contributions throughout an employee's career.The new offer came after the union members, which represent about 8 percent of the retailer's global workforce, rejected an earlier proposal that would not have extended coverage in the defined benefit pension plan to non-participating employees.The new agreement allows those employees - about 4,000 on the East Coast on a 401(k) plan - to join the other roughly 12,000 in California in their defined benefit plan, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said on Tuesday.The breakthrough comes as a tight U.S. labor market prompts retailers to improve pay and benefits. Reuters reported on Monday that Target Corp was lifting its minimum hourly pay by $1 to $10, its second hike in a year and following a similar bump by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Without disclosing details, the Teamsters said that language and economic changes allowed it to reverse position and recommend the offer. Ratification would conclude a 12-year push to make the pension change, the head negotiator said.The new plan ""means more money being contributed especially throughout an employee's career,"" Rome Aloise told Reuters. ""The way the Costco plan works is the longer you are there the more you get, which is what they believe in: That you get rewarded for your longevity."" Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Costco has a reputation as a good employer with relatively high wages, standing out in a retail industry that faces criticism from labor activists for not paying workers enough to make ends meet. But Costco had characterized the initial, rejected proposal as its ""last, best and final offer,"" the union said last month.When asked why Costco changed its mind even though the new agreement could increase costs, Aloise said he believed the company came to understand how important the pension was to the workers. ""Costco is a rare company,"" he said.West Coast union members will likely vote on the contract in early May and East Coast members in June, Aloise said.In its latest annual report, Costco said it had 205,000 employees globally, all non-union with the exception of those represented by the Teamsters. It said it considered its employee relations to be very good.

158,"   By Nathan Layne  Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) plans to expand business with chicken supplier Pilgrim's Pride Corp (PPC.O) even after building its own poultry processing plant in Nebraska, a senior executive at the retailer told Reuters.Shares of Pilgrim's Pride have fallen more than 5 percent since April 14 when a development council in Nebraska unveiled plans for the Costco plant, reflecting investor concerns that it could eat into the supply from a Pilgrim's Pride plant in Alabama.Jeff Lyons, a senior vice president at Costco, said the retailer expected to expand business with Pilgrim's Pride at the Alabama facility. He said Costco's need for chicken overall should increase markedly in the coming years assuming even a ""moderate"" annual unit growth rate of 5 to 8 percent.""We’ve got a long-term deal with Pilgrim's that we will continue to extend because they are helping us achieve our goals,"" he said in an interview on Monday. ""It will continue and it will expand. We are working on projects with them right now."" The facility, if built in Nebraska's Dodge County, would create 1,100 jobs and bring $180 million to the region, the Greater Fremont Development Council said in its April 14 release.Lyons said Nebraska was ideal due to the proximity of grain producers, from which it would procure 300,000 bushels of corn and thousands of tons of soybean meal each week. He said the facility, when fully operational in 2019, would produce 1.6 million birds a week, accounting for a third of its fresh chicken needs.Costco currently has three conventional suppliers of chicken and four for organic birds, Lyons said. He described Foster Farms, another conventional supplier, as a ""good partner"" and said Costco was ""working on something with them right now for the future but it's not done."" He did not name the third supplier. When asked whether Costco could one day drop a supplier, Lyons said it was possible, but that ""it just depends how it plays out."" He said in the case one was dropped it could pick up business from Costco in another area.Lyons said Costco was building the plant in part because chicken producers were focusing increasingly on larger birds, and it needed to secure supply for middle-sized birds that provide the right level of tenderness and other qualities for its rotisserie chickens and other products. The plant would also give its buyers industry experience that would help in negotiations, he said.  He said he was also looking at a possible deal for ""another species,"" but declined to elaborate on whether it was related to beef, pork or something else. ""Another species, a different animal. Not chickens.""

161,"  * Competition from Costco own-brand devices a concern* Expects some negative customer reaction to AudioNova deal* Shares down 7 pct   (Adds new CEO quote, analyst comment, share price)ZURICH, May 18 Swiss hearing aid maker Sonova  missed full-year targets and lowered its sales outlook on Wednesday, suggesting it could take some time to reap benefits from this month's acquisition of AudioNova, sending its shares sharply lower.Sonova has been hurt by slower than expected growth for its U.S. cochlear implant business and by customer Costco's  move to sell own-brand hearing aids at cheaper prices than Sonova's devices on neighbouring shelves.Though Sonova expects the 830 million euro ($953 million) takeover of Netherlands-based retailer AudioNova to pay off over time, Chief Executive Lukas Braunschweiler acknowledged that it could lose some European customers unhappy with its expanded role as both supplier and competitor.""We expect, and you can see that from our guidance in the coming year, a certain negative reaction from isolated customers in Europe,"" Braunschweiler said. ""The coming year will be one of transformation."" Shares in Sonova were down 7 percent at 1403 GMT, with the day shaping up to be the stock's worst in 16 months.The company reported sales in the year to March 31 rose 5.8 percent to 2.07 billion Swiss francs ($2.11 billion), compared with a target of 6-8 percent target.Constant currency earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) were up 1.4 percent at 430.6 million francs, against a target of between 3 percent and 7 percent. 'WEAK' GUIDANCE Braunschweiler's new guidance for 2016/17 -- sales growth of 4-6 percent and EBITA expansion of 3-7 percent -- was described as ""weak"" by Berenberg analysts, who listed customer  disenchantment with Sonova's retail acquisition strategy, recession-plagued Brazil and problems at Costco among the company's main woes. ""Costco is a concern, as this had been a key growth driver and Sonova appears to be losing ground to the new own-brand,"" Berenberg's Tom Jones wrote in a note.Braunschweiler said that prices for Costco's Kirkland-branded hearing aids were recently cut by a further $200 to $1,800. Sonova's Phonak Brio model at Costco can cost hundreds more.Even so, Braunschweiler said that Sonova cannot abandon supplying hearing aids through Costco because margins from those transactions exceed those of Sonova's other U.S. retail outlets.""We have to be a part of this channel because it is growing,"" Braunschweiler said. ""But there's the question of how we position our products, and there are ongoing discussions with Costco about how we'll do this.""(Reporting by John Miller; Editing by David Goodman)",2016-05-18,COST,"Wed May 18, 2016 | 10:35am EDT","UPDATE 1-Sonova falls short of full-year targets, shares plunge",http://www.reuters.com//article/sonova-results-idUSL5N18F2BD?type=companyNews
162,"  ZURICH Sonova (SOON.S) on Wednesday missed full-year sales and profit targets that the Swiss hearing aid maker had already cut last year as cochlear implant sales remained sluggish and big U.S. retailer Costco slashed prices on its own-brand products.Sales in local currency rose 5.8 percent to 2.07 billion Swiss francs ($2.11 billion) in the company's fiscal year to March, it said in a statement, behind Sonova's 6-8 percent target. Constant currency earnings before interest, taxes and amortization rose 1.4 percent to 430.6 million francs, compared to its 3-7 percent goal. Income after taxes fell to 345 million francs, from 368 million francs in 2014/2015.Sonova fell short as results were dented by a U.S. cochlear implant business that has not shifted from children to adults as quickly as anticipated and by customer Costco's (COST.O) focus on its own Kirkland-brand hearing aids at prices that Sonova's devices struggled to compete against.""Costco has changed the strategy with Kirkland, they lowered the end user price by another $200 for two instruments, so they are down now from $2,000 to $1,800 for two fully fitted instruments, and that's a brutal low price,"" said Sonova Chief Executive Officer Lukas Braunschweiler in an interview.  This month, Sonova said it was buying Netherlands' retailer AudioNova as it seeks to revive momentum and counter threats from rivals such as Signia, William Demant (WDH.CO) and GN Store Nord (GN.CO), which are also buying retailers where they remove competing products from the shelves.For the current year, Sonova expects sales to grow in the range of 4 to 6 percent and EBITA to increase by 3 to 7 percent, both measured in local currencies.

172,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal appeals court on Thursday threw out a $7.25 billion antitrust settlement reached by Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) with millions of retailers that accused the card networks of improperly fixing credit and debit card fees.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said the accord was unfair to retailers that stood to receive no payments and, in the court's view, little or no benefit at all. It also decertified the case as a class action.""This is not a settlement; it is a confiscation,"" wrote Circuit Judge Pierre Leval, a member of the three-judge panel that unanimously struck down the settlement.The deal had been the largest all-cash U.S. antitrust settlement, though its value shrank to about $5.7 billion after roughly 8,000 retailers ""opted out.""Thursday's decision is a blow to the credit card industry, which hoped the settlement would end a decade of litigation brought on behalf of about 12 million retailers against Visa, MasterCard and banks that issue their cards.It was intended to resolve claims that merchants were overcharged on interchange fees, or swipe fees, when shoppers used credit or debit cards, and were barred from directing customers toward cheaper means of payment.The settlement may now need to be renegotiated, or the case could go to trial.""Swipe fees are an improper and unnecessary hidden tax on consumers,"" said Jeffrey Shinder, a Constantine Cannon partner representing Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O), Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) and other opponents of the accord. ""The structure of swipe fees is back on the table.""Visa spokeswoman Connie Kim said the Foster City, California-based company is reviewing the decision.MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said the company, based in Purchase, New York, is disappointed in the decision and will review its next steps. Visa shares closed down $2.57, or 3.3 percent, at $74.17. MasterCard fell $4.07, or 4.4 percent, to $88.06.

194,"   By Nathan Layne and Solarina Ho  Two executives of Costco Wholesale Corp  may have sought kickbacks from drug makers in violation of Ontario law, an industry regulator in the Canadian province has found as it advances a probe into the retailer's pharmacy business.The Ontario College of Pharmacists launched an investigation into the executives for alleged misconduct after a former sales consultant for Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals filed a complaint saying the Costco executives sought illegal rebates of up to $1.3 million on drugs supplied to the retailer.Costco has denied the allegations, saying the company and the two executives have complied with all laws. Stuart Shamis, an attorney for the retailer, said there had been no finding of wrongdoing. He declined to comment on specific allegations.The regulator's investigation into the two men found sufficient evidence to refer the matter to its discipline committee, according to a notice on its website last week.

195,"   By Nathan Layne and Solarina Ho  Nov 22 Two executives of Costco Wholesale Corp  may have sought kickbacks from drug makers in violation of Ontario law, an industry regulator in the Canadian province has found as it advances a probe into the retailer's pharmacy business.The Ontario College of Pharmacists launched an investigation into the executives for alleged misconduct after a former sales consultant for Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals filed a complaint saying the Costco executives sought illegal rebates of up to $1.3 million on drugs supplied to the retailer.Costco has denied the allegations, saying the company and the two executives have complied with all laws. Stuart Shamis, an attorney for the retailer, said there had been no finding of wrongdoing. He declined to comment on specific allegations.The regulator's investigation into the two men found sufficient evidence to refer the matter to its discipline committee, according to a notice on its website last week.

They are sitting on hefty inventories of unsold sedans, compact cars and sports cars as consumers shift to pickup trucks and SUVs.The share prices of General Motors Co (GM.N), Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCAU.N) (FCHA.MI) are flat to down for the year. This reflects investor concerns that a six-year auto sales boom in the United States is reaching an end and that sustaining sales levels will require more aggressive price cutting. ""We are seeing a tougher pricing environment, higher levels of discounts,"" said Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields. He predicted November and December sales would be about the same as a year ago, when the annualized sales pace averaged about 17.9 million vehicles a year.Ford kicked off its Black Friday sales promotions in early November, after reporting an 11.7 percent drop in October sales. Rivals have since followed suit. GM's GMC truck brand is promoting ""Black Friday All Month Long"" with discounts of as much as 20 percent off list prices for pickup trucks.Luxury automakers usually join the fray in December. Toyota Motor Corp's (7203.T) Lexus brand began touting its annual ""December to Remember"" deals ahead of Thanksgiving weekend, offering 0.9 percent, five-year loans or $1,000 off on its compact IS 300 sedan in certain markets.GM this week began offering markdowns on the Chevrolet Corvette sports car through retailer Costco Wholesale Corp's (COST.O) car-buying club, the first time the Corvette has been offered through the discount retailer's car buying service. At the start of the month, there were 122 days of Corvette inventory, up 51 percent from a year earlier and nearly double the level automakers consider ideal, according to Automotive News data.Like other retailers, automakers use holiday-themed promotions to boost sales during the final two months of the year, and like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Target Corp (TGT.N) and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), automakers have steadily expanded the Christmas season over the past several years.

198,"  Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O) said on Thursday that Ontario's health ministry would launch a probe into allegations it got illegal kickbacks from drugmakers, becoming the Canadian province's second regulator to scrutinize the matter.The retailer has been informed by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care that it would conduct an inspection into its compliance with the Ontario Drug Benefit Act (ODBA) and other regulations, a Costco executive told Reuters in an email.""We are confident that Costco has complied with the legislation and the regulations and we intend to co-operate fully with the inspection,"" Corporate Counsel Stuart Shamis wrote in response to questions about the probe.The move comes two weeks after investigators at the Ontario College of Pharmacists (OCP) said they found sufficient evidence to indicate that two Costco pharmacy directors had sought illegal kickbacks, sending a matter involving rebates to its disciplinary panel for the first time since Ontario completely banned rebates in 2013.The provincial ministry's inspection will focus on whether Costco has been compliant with the ODBA, the law governing Ontario's drug benefit plan. It is separate from the OCP's probe, which determines matters of professional misconduct.  David Jensen, a health ministry spokesman, would not comment on Costco specifically. When asked about possible punishment, he  said the ministry's executive officer had the power to make a company found to have received an illegal rebate pay the same amount to the government.The regulatory scrutiny on Costco was first triggered by a former sales consultant for Ranbaxy Pharmaceuticals who submitted a complaint last year to the OCP alleging that two Costco executives sought illegal rebates of up to $1.3 million on drugs supplied to the retailer. In addition to Ranbaxy, which was acquired by India's Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (SUN.NS) last year, units of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (TEVA.TA), Mylan NV (MYL.O) and  Pharmascience Inc were also listed in the OCP's allegations as possibly having paid rebates to Costco between April 2013 and Dec. 31, 2015.A Mylan spokeswoman told Reuters last month that the company was not a subject of the OCP's probe and had cooperated with requests for information.
