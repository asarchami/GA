0,"   By Noel Randewich | LAS VEGAS  LAS VEGAS Chipmaker Nvidia Corp gave new details of an upcoming chip with beefed-up graphics for mobile gadgets and cars as it faces a slowing personal computer industry and harsh competition in smartphones and tablets.The K1 is Nvidia's first mobile chip to incorporate the Kepler graphics technology the company uses in the high-end components it makes for PC game enthusiasts, Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang told reporters at an event in Las Vegas on Sunday ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show.Huang in recent years has expanded Nvidia's business beyond its core PC market and into mobile devices with the company's Tegra lineup of chips. But he has encountered heavy competition from larger Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in making components for tablets and smartphones.Nvidia is betting that adding cutting-edge graphics technology to its mobile chips will entice more manufacturers and consumers to see tablets as viable alternatives to consoles for playing high-end games like first-person shooters.""We've brought mobile computing to the same level as desktop computing...the same level as supercomputing,"" Huang said of the K1's graphics technology. Nvidia's most recent Tegra 4 processors are used in Microsoft Corp's Surface 2 tablet and a smartphone made by Xiaomi in China, but Wall Street is concerned the company is making too little progress for the money it spends to develop the chips.In the third quarter, sales from Nvidia's Tegra mobile chips fell 54 percent and sales from its PC graphics chips, which account for the majority of the company's total revenue, declined 2 percent.The K1 was previously codenamed Logan, an alias of the comic book superhero Wolverine. An automotive version of the chip will be ideal for camera-based computation in future self-driving cars with applications like pedestrian detection and collision avoidance, Huang said. Following in the footsteps of recent chip announcements from Qualcomm, Samsung and Apple Inc, Nvidia's Tegra K1 lineup will also include a version with 64-bit features typically found in personal computers.Processors with 64-bit features can take advantage of more memory than 32-bit processors now found in most mobile devices, potentially letting them work faster and more efficiently. Current smartphones don't have enough memory to give 64-bit processors an advantage of 32-bit chips, but future phones probably will include enough memory to give the 64-bit processors a performance boost.Nvidia said it expects a 32-bit version of the K1 chip to appear in devices in the first half of 2014, with the 64-bit chip appearing later in the year.With progress in mobile devices slow, Nvidia is increasingly looking to the automotive industry and cloud computing to fuel future growth. It has made deals with Audi, BMW and Tesla to use Tegra chips in dashboard entertainment and navigation systems.At last year's Consumer Electronics Show, Nvidia unveiled a handheld gaming device called Shield, made with its Tegra 4 chip and based on Google Inc's Android platform.

The triangle is a basic building block in video game graphics.But Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang said on Wednesday that Nvidia put the project on hold after leasing office space late last year in a existing building by its headquarters.""We will absolutely need a new campus eventually. In the short term, with this new facility, we're in pretty good shape,"" Huang said in an interview.Earlier on Wednesday, Nvidia posted higher fiscal fourth-quarter revenue that beat Wall Street's expectations, fueled by the chipmaker's PC gaming components, even as it grapples with an expansion beyond computers and into mobile devices.When Nvidia unveiled plans for its new campus a year ago, Huang wrote a blogpost showing off images of buildings with vast open floors optimized for ""cross-functional work,"" with skylights in the shape of criss-crossed triangles taking up almost all of the buildings' roofs.Nvidia has been just one of many Silicon Valley tech companies to plan major headquarter improvements in recent years.

13,"   By Emily Flitter and Sarah N. Lynch | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON A former accounting manager for Nvidia Corp has settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations he leaked non-public information about the chipmaker that allowed a group of Wall Street analysts to make millions through illegal trades, the SEC announced on Wednesday.The SEC said Chris Choi of San Jose, California will pay $30,000 to settle civil charges that he shared confidential tips with a friend who passed them on to a circle of hedge fund employees.Choi is settling without admitting or denying the charges. His lawyer declined to comment.The Wall Street circle that benefited from Choi's tips included two former portfolio managers, Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, whose insider trading convictions are being examined by a federal appeals court.Another one of the portfolio managers who eventually received information leaked from Choi was former SAC Capital employee Michael Steinberg, who was convicted in December on criminal charges related to insider trading. The SEC's announcement came a day after a round of intense questioning, as part of Newman and Chiasson's appeal, by judges on 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on whether recipients of non-public information can be found guilty of insider trading without any requirement prosecutors prove they knew the source of the tip benefited from the disclosure.Newman's lawyer questioned why Choi or the other source of inside information in the case - an employee of the computer maker Dell - were never charged with wrongdoing.The lawyer, Stephen Fishbein, called Newman and Chiasson's case ""the only one where the insider was not charged with anything."" The SEC said Choi is the 45th defendant to be charged, as part of a probe into the activities of expert networks. A spokesman declined to comment on whether there was any connection between the timing of the settlement with Choi and the Newman and Chiasson appeal hearing.The SEC's complaint against Choi said he passed information about Nvidia's quarterly earnings to a friend, Hyung Lim, who in turn received payments from an analyst who shared the information with others. ""Choi provided the material non public information to Lim, in breach of the fiduciary duty that Choi, an employee of Nvidia, owed to Nvidia, and did so with the expectation of receiving a benefit and/or to confer a financial benefit,"" it said.Stephen Crimmins, a partner at K&L Gates who is not involved in the case, said Choi's settlement was unlikely to influence the outcome of the pending appeal.""This is the SEC typing up another aspect of this situation, but I don't think it materially changes the inquiry that the 2nd Circuit will go through as it resolves the Newman and Chiasson case,"" he said. ""The question is, will we require a showing that Newman and Chiasson were aware that a benefit had been conveyed?""The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.

Another one of the portfolio managers who eventually received information leaked from Choi was former SAC Capital employee Michael Steinberg, who was convicted in December on criminal charges related to insider trading.The SEC's announcement came a day after a round of intense questioning, as part of Newman and Chiasson's appeal, by judges on 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York on whether recipients of non-public information can be found guilty of insider trading without any requirement prosecutors prove they knew the source of the tip benefited from the disclosure.Newman's lawyer questioned why Choi or the other source of inside information in the case - an employee of the computer maker Dell - were never charged with wrongdoing. The lawyer, Stephen Fishbein, called Newman and Chiasson's case ""the only one where the insider was not charged with anything.""The SEC said Choi is the 45th defendant to be charged, as part of a probe into the activities of expert networks. A spokesman declined to comment on whether there was any connection between the timing of the settlement with Choi and the Newman and Chiasson appeal hearing. The SEC's complaint against Choi said he passed information about Nvidia's quarterly earnings to a friend, Hyung Lim, who in turn received payments from an analyst who shared the information with others.""Choi provided the material non public information to Lim, in breach of the fiduciary duty that Choi, an employee of Nvidia, owed to Nvidia, and did so with the expectation of receiving a benefit and/or to confer a financial benefit,"" it said.Stephen Crimmins, a partner at K&L Gates who is not involved in the case, said Choi's settlement was unlikely to influence the outcome of the pending appeal.""This is the SEC typing up another aspect of this situation, but I don't think it materially changes the inquiry that the 2nd Circuit will go through as it resolves the Newman and Chiasson case,"" he said. ""The question is, will we require a showing that Newman and Chiasson were aware that a benefit had been conveyed?""The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Choi, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 14-2879.   (Reporting by Sarah N.

16,"   By Marina Lopes | NEW YORK, April 23  NEW YORK, April 23 International Business Machines Corp, in its latest attempt at reviving demand for its hardware products, is launching high-end system servers that it says are 50 times faster than its closest competitor at analyzing data.The POWER8 servers, the product of a $2.4 billion, three-year investment, are part of the company's decade-long shift to higher-value hardware technology. IBM said the machines are 50 times faster than the low-end x86-based servers it sold to Chinese PC maker Lenovo Group Ltd in January..The technology services provider said on Wednesday it hopes the servers, designed for large-scale computing, will appeal to clients looking to manage new types of social and mobile computing and mass amounts of data.Last week, the company reported its lowest quarterly revenue in five years, weighed down by falling demand for its storage and server products. IBM dominates the higher-end server market with 57 percent market share, according to research firm Canalys.""For IBM customers in particular the POWER8 represents a generational jump forward so far as overall performance and system capacity goes,"" said Charles King, an analyst at Pund-IT in California. ""POWER8 should help IBM move forward in this very cloud-centric, analytic path that it has been working on,"" he said.Some analysts, however, say that IBM's shift to high-end servers makes products like POWER8 appealing only to niche customers. ""Not every app needs a high-end server,"" said Jefferies analyst Peter Misek. ""With IBM getting out of that lower-end business, it dramatically shrinks their addressable market.""In order to make the servers adaptable to different needs, IBM released the data specifications for its POWER8 processor to the OpenPOWER foundation, allowing the development community to deliver new system designs based on POWER8.The foundation, whose more than two dozen members include Google, Israeli chip designer Mellanox Technologies , U.S. chip-maker Nvidia Corp and Taiwan-based server supplier Tyan Computer Corp, will have access to hardware previously proprietary to IBM.

27,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Qualcomm, the world's No. 1 mobile chipmaker, may face a European investigation related to a four-year-old complaint from a subsidiary of rival Nvidia Corp, three people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.An EU probe would come at an awkward time for Qualcomm, which is seeking to end an investigation by China's pricing regulator into monopoly practices. If found guilty of breaching EU rules, the company could face a fine of up to $2.5 billion. ""The Commission may open a case after the summer,"" said one of the sources, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. British cellphone chipmaker Icera, acquired by Nvidia Corp in 2011, took its grievances to the European Commission in June 2010, accusing Qualcomm of anti-competitive behavior. Details of the complaint were never made public. But another person familiar with the issue said Icera had accused Qualcomm of using patent-related incentives and exclusionary pricing of chipsets to discourage customers from doing business with Icera. Until now, the issue appeared to have faded from the Commission's agenda, with the latest request for information to Qualcomm dated July last year. But regulators decided to fast-track the case after Europe's second-highest court in June upheld a record 1.1 billion euro EU fine against U.S. chipmaker Intel for abuse of its dominant market position, according to one of the sources. It is not unusual for the EU competition authority to take several years to build a case before opening an investigation. The Commission's spokesman for competition policy, Antoine Colombani, declined to comment, as did Qualcomm. Companies can be fined as much as 10 percent of their global revenues for breaching EU antitrust rules. Such cases hold a special resonance for the European Union as technology firms in the 28-country block seek to boost their competitiveness by developing new innovative products, said antitrust lawyer Rachel Bickler at Nabarro.""Patent-related issues are very topical at the moment. I suspect technology and access to technology will remain very important to the Commission,"" she said.In 2010, the EU competition authority scrapped a four-year probe into Qualcomm after Swedish mobile telecom gear maker Ericsson and U.S. rival Texas Instruments withdrew their objections against the company. In 2009, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm 273 billion won ($268.6 million), the agency's biggest ever penalty against a single company, for abusing its dominant position in CDMA modem chips which were then used in handsets made by Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics.($1 = 1016.2500 Korean Won) (editing by Tom Pfeiffer and Pravin Char)",2014-08-27,NVDA,"Tue Aug 26, 2014 | 10:44pm EDT",Exclusive: Chipmaker Qualcomm may face EU antitrust probe - sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-eu-qualcomm-exclusive-idUSKBN0GQ14C20140827?type=companyNews
28,"   By Noel Randewich and Diane Bartz | SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON  SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON Nvidia Corp has sued rival chipmakers Qualcomm and Samsung Electronics, accusing both companies of infringing its patents on graphics processing technology.The U.S. chipmaker vies with Qualcomm in the business of providing chips for smartphones and tablets. It said on Thursday that Qualcomm and Samsung had used Nvidia's patented technologies without a license in Samsung's mobile devices, including the just-launched Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge.Nvidia said Samsung devices made with graphics technology from Qualcomm, Britain's ARM Holdings and Imagination Technologies infringed on its patents. ""They’re using our technology for free in their devices today and they’re shipping an enormous number of devices,"" Nvidia Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang said on a conference call.Qualcomm did not say it is suing Imagination or ARM but it did say it is asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to prevent shipments of Samsung devices containing ARM's Mali or Imagination's PowerVR graphics architectures, as well as Qualcomm's graphics technology. Graphics technology from Imagination is also used in Apple Inc's iPhones. Asked whether Nvidia plans to sue Apple since it uses Imagination's technology, Huang declined to comment.""Today we’re focused on Samsung and Qualcomm, and we continue to have productive conversations with a lot of other companies out there,” he said. Nvidia made its name developing leading graphics technology for high-end personal computers but has struggled to expand into smartphones, a market dominated by Qualcomm.  Nvidia discussed its patents with heavyweight handset maker Samsung for ""a couple"" of years before deciding to take legal action, Huang said.Last year, Nvidia announced that it planned to license its graphics technology to other companies. But it has not announced any licensing deals since then.  Nvidia said its lawsuits were filed at the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and at the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington.Such dual filings are typical of infringement lawsuits since the district courts can award financial damages and the Commission cannot. At the same time, the Commission can more easily ban infringing products from the U.S. market.Samsung and ARM declined to comment. Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment.

Qualcomm did not say it is suing Imagination or ARM but it did say it is asking the U.S. International Trade Commission to prevent shipments of Samsung devices containing ARM's Mali or Imagination's PowerVR graphics architectures, as well as Qualcomm's graphics technology.Graphics technology from Imagination is also used in Apple Inc's iPhones.

""Today we're focused on Samsung and Qualcomm, and we continue to have productive conversations with a lot of other companies out there,"" he said.Nvidia made its name developing leading graphics technology for high-end personal computers but has struggled to expand into smartphones, a market dominated by Qualcomm.Nvidia discussed its patents with heavyweight handset maker Samsung for ""a couple"" of years before deciding to take legal action, Huang said. Last year, Nvidia announced that it planned to license its graphics technology to other companies. But it has not announced any licensing deals since then.Nvidia said its lawsuits were filed at the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and at the U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington.Such dual filings are typical of infringement lawsuits since the district courts can award financial damages and the Commission cannot.

39,"  (Adds European probe is unrelated to Nvidia subsidiary in paragraph 11)By Noel RandewichSAN FRANCISCO Nov 5 Qualcomm Inc  warned on Wednesday that an antitrust investigation and problems collecting royalties could harm its business in China next year and it also disclosed new regulatory investigations in the United States and Europe.China's expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm's opportunities have been clouded by an 11-month-old antitrust investigation there.Wall Street is worried. Qualcomm could face a fine of more than $1 billion in China as a result of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) investigation, and the company could be forced to make concessions that would hurt its highly profitable business of charging royalties on phones that use its patents.Qualcomm also said it faces a new probe by the European Commission about rebates and other financial incentives in the sale of its chips. Another preliminary investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission concerns a potential breach of licensing terms, the company said. On Wednesday, Qualcomm's shares slid about 6 percent at $72.50 in extended trading from a $77.20 close on the Nasdaq.""We're continuing to cooperate with the NDRC. We've continued to meet with them regularly, exchange some ideas for potential ways to resolve it,"" Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said in a telephone interview. ""But we don't have an ability to update in terms of expectations and timing.""Qualcomm has also been struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China, including local manufacturers the U.S. chipmaker has done little or no business with in the past. Any concessions on royalties that Qualcomm is forced to make in China could spread to manufacturers in other countries, some investors said.""What people are most worried about is the ability to fence in this issue to Chinese vendors if there's a reduced royalty rate, or does it spread to other geographies,"" Standard Life portfolio manager Brian Fox said.Qualcomm said it was difficult to predict the outcome of the U.S. and European investigations. The European probe is separate from a four-year-old complaint to the European Commission from a subsidiary of Nvidia Corp over alleged patent-related incentives and exclusionary pricing by Qualcomm.Qualcomm forecast revenue for fiscal 2015 of between $26.8 billion and $28.8 billion. Analysts on average expected $28.91 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company also expects non-GAAP earnings per share in fiscal 2015 to be between $5.05 and $5.35.

60,"  * Car companies use Nvidia's ""supercomputer on a chip""* Automotive culture invades Silicon Valley* Chipmaker's rivals include Intel, Texas Instruments* Learning the meaning of ""automotive grade""By Paul LienertDETROIT, May 14 It took Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia Corp the better part of a decade to gain acceptance as a global automotive supplier, a lesson for other technology firms hoping to make a similar transition from consumer electronics to car components.Nvidia had a thriving business in supplying powerful graphics processors for video game consoles and laptop computers when representatives of Volkswagen AG asked if it could adapt the same realistic, three-dimensional displays for the dashboards of Audi luxury cars.That was 10 years ago - several lifetimes in Silicon Valley terms, but just a couple of model changes ago for the big car maker. It took six years for Nvidia to develop the chips to power the 3-D navigation system display that launched on the 2011 Audi A8, the brand's top-of-the-line sedan, compared with three to four years to develop a new chip for gaming applications.Along the way, Nvidia engineers learned the hard way they could not just pop a chip designed for a laptop or a game console into a car.""We had to be taught what 'automotive grade' meant,"" recalls Danny Shapiro, Nvidia's senior director of automotive operations. In simple terms, that meant no reboots - because a dashboard screen that fails to light up means an angry customer and possibly an expensive warranty repair. The decade-long effort enabled Nvidia to make the jump from the world of computers and game consoles into the fast-growing market for advanced automotive displays and automated driving systems. It is a leap that other Silicon Valley tech companies want to emulate to cash in on the convergence of automobiles and digital connectivity.Nvidia's success in landing processors on cars including the Audi A8 and the Tesla Model S sedan illustrates the growing willingness among automakers to look beyond their traditional suppliers to obtain a technological edge.""They offer us computing systems with the strength"" to process vast amounts of data required by new driver assistance systems and displays, said Ulrich Hackenberg, Audi's head of technical development.Nvidia is still a niche player with a long way to go to crack the top league of traditional automotive chip suppliers. Much larger companies, including Japan's Renesas Electronics Corp and U.S. chipmakers Texas Instruments Inc, Intel Corp and Qualcomm Inc, dominate the automotive chip business.Nvidia's automotive sales represented just 4 percent of the company's $4.7 billion annual revenue in its most recent fiscal year. That in turn is just one-tenth of the $1.86 billion in automotive semiconductors that Texas Instruments sold last year. Brooke Williams, TI's business manager for driver assistance systems, said his company already knows how to deal with automakers' demands after 35 years of supplying products for vehicles. ""We understand the automotive design cycle and how the vehicle manufacturers and suppliers work.""SELF-DRIVING CARS Nvidia has made the leap to infotainment systems in vehicles, but not yet to self-driving cars.The company had just $23 million in sales in the automotive segment in 2011. Growth has surged since. This year, the company expects automotive revenue of $183 million, and says it has booked more than $2 billion in future automotive business, most of that involving chips for digital displays and infotainment. By 2020, Nvidia expects to have chips on more than 32 million vehicles. The company is pushing to crack the emerging market for driver assistance systems, which include such tasks as self-parking and semi-automated steering and braking. Those systems require huge amounts of computing power in very small packages. Nvidia has developed and begun selling a chip called the Tegra X1 for automotive and gaming uses, which it says can put the power of a supercomputer in a package about the size of a postage stamp.""Nvidia brings unparalleled graphics capabilities that could prove critical building blocks"" for driver assistance systems, said Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore.Nvidia got coaching from automotive customers who liked the company's technology but were not sure of its ability to measure up to their standards.Early in their relationship, Audi executives took Nvidia engineers on a trip to Audi's home factory in Ingolstadt, Germany.""We told the Nvidia guys, 'you make one part, but we assemble a car here from 10,000 pieces,'"" said Mathias Halliger, Audi's senior systems architect for connected vehicle technologies. ""If even one part is bad, we have a problem.""To drive home the point, an Audi tour guide noted that one of the luxury cars had been rejected because of a tiny flaw in the paint.The plant tour, Halliger said, ""helped Nvidia to understand our requirements. It showed dramatically what we were looking for.""There was more for Nvidia to learn. A typical automotive production cycle can run five years or more, compared with one year for many consumer products. Nvidia had to go back to its suppliers to make sure that key components, from memory to power supply, could be upgraded as needed over that longer life cycle.""When you work with car companies and you engage in these developments with them, over the years you adopt their culture,"" said Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jen-Hsun Huang, whose personal automotive stable includes two Ferraris and two Teslas.  ""But the car is dying to be reinvented.""

65,"   By Kshitiz Goliya  Nvidia Corp reported a surprise rise in second-quarter revenue and gave a better-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter, helped by strong demand for its graphic chips used in gaming and cars.The company's shares rose nearly 10 percent in extended trading on Thursday.Nvidia's revenue increased 4.5 percent in the quarter ended July 26, while analysts on average were expecting revenue to decrease about 8 percent.The company forecast sales would fall in the third quarter, but the decline was again less than analysts' expectations.Nvidia gets a majority of its revenue from its graphic chips made for personal computers, and there were fears that the fall in PC sales would hurt Nvidia just like it has Intel Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.But, Nvidia said gaming revenue rose 59 percent, helped by strong sales of its popular GeForce series of gaming chips. ""The near term story continues to be PC gaming,"" said Wedbush Securities analyst Betsy Van Hees. ""That is the key driver for them and they continue to dominate in that area.""Nvidia has also been increasing its focus on making chips that allows people to play graphics-heavy games over the internet and chips used in a car's dashboard display and in self-driving cars.Automotive revenue rose 76 percent in the quarter and accounted for only 6.2 percent of total revenue. The company said 8 million cars on the road were using its chips and that it was working with more than 50 companies for its DRIVE chip for self-driving cars.Van Hees said car chips would be a very important long-term story.However, revenue in Nvidia's enterprise business fell 14 percent. The business, which makes chips used for software such as AutoCAD, accounted for 16.2 percent of total revenue. The company's total revenue rose 4.5 percent to $1.15 billion in the second quarter. Analysts had expected $1.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income slumped nearly 80 percent to $26 million in the quarter due to higher costs and a bigger tax bill.Nvidia forecast revenue to fall to $1.16-$1.20 billion in the current quarter from $1.23 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected a fall to $1.10 billion.Nvidia's shares rose 9.7 percent to $22.43 in extended trading. They had risen nearly 2 percent this year through Thursday, compared with a 11.6 percent fall in the Dow Jones US chip index.

82,"   By Nate Raymond | NEW YORK, March 1  NEW YORK, March 1 A former hedge fund manager who admitted to trading on non-public information about various technology companies and became a cooperating witness in a wide-ranging insider trading investigation was spared prison on Tuesday by a federal judge.Samir Barai, the founder of Barai Capital Management, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts in Manhattan to two years of supervised release and ordered to forfeit $216,603.Barai, 46, apologized for conduct that caused him to ""lose my good name and reputation,"" and made him one of dozens charged by federal prosecutors under Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara during an insider trading crackdown.""I paid a high price for these crimes,"" he said. Barai pleaded guilty in 2011 to securities fraud and other charges over a scheme that also involved Noah Freeman and Donald Longueuil, two former portfolio managers at billionaire Steven A. Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors hedge fund.Prosecutors said the men were close friends who sought an edge by pooling inside information they obtained about companies including Nvidia Corp and Marvell Technology Group Ltd . Among the people who provided Barai and Freeman information was Winifred Jiau, a consultant with Primary Global Research, an expert networking firm that paired investors with industry experts, many of whom worked for publicly-traded companies.Prosecutors said Jiau, who was also a contract employee for Nvidia, had formed an ""investment club"" with a finance employee at Nvidia and Marvell, giving her access to details about its financial results in 2007 and 2008 that she could pass along. Barai's illegal gains totaled $3.91 million, prosecutors said.Jiau was convicted at trial and sentenced in 2011 to four years in prison. Longueuil pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 2-1/2 years in prison in 2011. Freeman pleaded guilty and was given a non-prison sentence in February 2015.The case is U.S. v. Barai, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-cr-00116.
