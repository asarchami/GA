Publicis also said on Thursday that it aimed to keep improving its operating profit margin this year, which rose to 16.5 percent from 16.1 percent in 2013 despite the ""disappointment"" on growth.""This is not a reversal of the market,"" said Chief Executive Maurice Levy.""Based on what we have seen since the beginning of the year, we think this is just a blip. It does not call into question our growth plan for this year.""Shares were up 1.6 percent to 66.89 euros at 8:28GMT, while the European media index fell 0.25 percent. ""Publicis shares remain robust as investors look through weaker operating momentum towards the potential for cash returns from the Omnicom deal,"" wrote UBS analyst Tamsin Garrity.The Paris-based agency posted organic sales growth of 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter to 1.93 billion euros ($2.6 billion). It did markedly worse than its soon-to-be partner Omnicom, which saw 4.2 percent organic growth, helped by strong demand in Latin America and Asia.Levy said the weakness stemmed from stagnating demand in Europe and a dip in activity in emerging markets. In China, where Publicis works for many luxury companies, sales were hit by a government clampdown on gift-giving to public officials that has hurt purveyors of high-end spirits and luxury goods. India slowed, too, ahead of national elections.Full-year organic growth stood at 2.6 percent for revenue of 6.95 billion euros. Analysts were expecting 3 percent organic growth, according to investment bank UBS.Operating profit grew nearly 7.8 percent to 1.15 billion euros, while net profit rose 11.5 percent to 816 million.Publicis, which also competes with WPP Plc and Interpublic Group, said it would pay a dividend of 1.10 euros per share for 2013, up 22 percent from a year earlier.Publicis shares closed down 2.7 percent at 65.74 euros on Wednesday ahead of the results, giving it a market capitalisation of 14 billion euros.Levy said the merger with Omnicom was on track to close by the end of the first half of the year, and that the two sides had obtained 14 out of the 15 required national regulatory approvals, with only China outstanding.""Everything is going fine, although it is taking a bit more time than expected,"" he said.",2014-02-13,OMC,"Thu Feb 13, 2014 | 3:40am EST",UPDATE 2-Publicis posts weak Q4 on emerging markets,http://www.reuters.com//article/publicis-results-idUSL5N0LI0RP20140213?type=companyNews
9,"   By Kate Holton | BARCELONA  BARCELONA Feb 27 Fierce competition in the global advertising industry forced Britain's WPP to lower its profit guidance for 2014 on Thursday, wiping more than a billion pounds off its share price and overshadowing its improving trading throughout 2013.The world's largest advertising group said it had outperformed the rest of the industry in winning new business but the combination of clients demanding more for less, and currency fluctuations had hit its operating margins on a reported basis.The company's operating margin for 2013 rose 0.3 margin points to 15.1 percent, below its annual growth target of 0.5 points, while it lowered its outlook for 2014 target to 0.3 margin points growth.The forecast for this year also excludes the impact of currency swings, which could still take a heavy toll on a group that, led by Martin Sorrell, expanded early in emerging markets which have proved highly volatile of late.In the final quarter of 2013, when approximately 40 percent of WPP's profits were earned, sterling strengthened against many currencies by 10 to 20 percent in key faster growth markets such as India, South Africa and Brazil.""All in all, 2014 looks to be another demanding year, as a strong UK pound and weak fast-growth market currencies continue to take their toll on our reported operating margins,"" said Sorrell, who has built WPP into one of Britain's biggest companies during his 28 years at the top. ""We have the same (long-term margin) target, it will just take us longer to get there. The reason is pressure from clients in terms of they want more for less, and a lot of competition and competitive discounting in media pricing.""DISAPPOINTING OUTLOOK  The disappointing profit outlook overshadowed the group's overall trading in terms of the main industry metric - like for like revenue growth - which rose 3.5 percent in 2013, in line with forecasts. It was up 5.7 percent in January.WPP had traded well in the second half of the year, winning new work and taking advantage of the $35 billion merger of its two biggest rivals, Omnicom and Publicis, which will make them the largest ad group in the world once the deal closes.The British firm recorded a 57 percent jump in net new business billings, reflecting how it has poached blue-chip firms from the soon-to-be American-Franco supergroup, which faces conflicts of interest amongst its combined client base. Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said the lowering of the margin target would give WPP more scope to respond to the increasing pressures in the industry.""We think WPP has done the right thing in admitting this and reducing its guidance in one go, but it does introduce the question of structural risk into the agencies' story,"" he said.WPP was the last major ad group to report its results. Publicis, led by Sorrell's sparring partner Maurice Levy, reported a slowdown in trading in the fourth quarter, while Omnicom ended the year well.WPP shares, which had risen over the last month, fell 6 percent, wiping just over a billion pounds off its shares and cutting market capitalisation to 16.8 billion pounds, as analysts said the revised guidance would hit expectations for 2014 earnings per share.Shares in Publicis were down 1.4 percent.""Something of a mixed bag at first take,"" Jefferies analysts said. ""All in all, a creditworthy print, though perhaps not enough to keep the bulls happy. We see value here but the stock may give something up in the short term.""",2014-02-27,OMC,"Thu Feb 27, 2014 | 9:42am EST",UPDATE 3-Currency swings and ad competition hit WPP's shares,http://www.reuters.com//article/wpp-results-idUSL6N0LW12I20140227?type=companyNews
10,"  BOSTON Shareholder activist John Chevedden has won favorable rulings in separate federal suits brought by Omnicom Group Inc and EMC Corp, breaking a pattern of legal setbacks for the private investor.Chevedden, who lives near Los Angeles, is well-known in corporate governance circles for the proposals he files at scores of companies each year calling for changes such as having an independent board chairman. Some companies have successfully sued to block his measures.In January, advertising company Omnicom sued Chevedden in U.S. District Court in New York, seeking a declaration it could leave off its annual proxy statement to shareholders one of his proposals calling for shareholder voting tallies to be kept confidential. Omnicom argued such a change could break New York state law.But in an order on Tuesday Judge Louis Stanton granted a motion by Chevedden to dismiss the suit. Stanton noted Chevedden promised not to sue if Omnicom excludes his proposal and added that ""the possibility of SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) investigation or action is remote.""In a similar case in January, data-storage company EMC sued Chevedden and ally James McRitchie in U.S. District Court in Boston. EMC sought a declaration it could exclude from its proxy statement their proposal that the company's board chairman should be independent. But in a March 7 hearing, Judge Mark Wolf dismissed the case, according to a transcript issued Tuesday. Like Judge Stanton, Wolf said there is little risk of an SEC enforcement action if EMC excluded the proposal.A spokesman for Omnicom did not immediately return messages late Tuesday. EMC spokesman Dave Farmer via email said Wolf's order ""did not reach the issue of whether the proposal satisfies SEC rules. EMC is exploring all its options.""In an interview, Chevedden called the rulings ""overwhelmingly positive.""

11,"  BOSTON, March 11 Shareholder activist John Chevedden has won favorable rulings in separate federal suits brought by Omnicom Group Inc and EMC Corp, breaking a pattern of legal setbacks for the private investor.Chevedden, who lives near Los Angeles, is well-known in corporate governance circles for the proposals he files at scores of companies each year calling for changes such as having an independent board chairman. Some companies have successfully sued to block his measures.In January, advertising company Omnicom sued Chevedden in U.S. District Court in New York, seeking a declaration it could leave off its annual proxy statement to shareholders one of his proposals calling for shareholder voting tallies to be kept confidential. Omnicom argued such a change could break New York state law.But in an order on Tuesday Judge Louis Stanton granted a motion by Chevedden to dismiss the suit. Stanton noted Chevedden promised not to sue if Omnicom excludes his proposal and added that ""the possibility of SEC (Securities Exchange Commission) investigation or action is remote."" In a similar case in January, data-storage company EMC sued Chevedden and ally James McRitchie in U.S. District Court in Boston. EMC sought a declaration it could exclude from its proxy statement their proposal that the company's board chairman should be independent.But in a March 7 hearing, Judge Mark Wolf dismissed the case, according to a transcript issued Tuesday. Like Judge Stanton, Wolf said there is little risk of an SEC enforcement action if EMC excluded the proposal. A spokesman for Omnicom did not immediately return messages late Tuesday.EMC spokesman Dave Farmer via email said Wolf's order ""did not reach the issue of whether the proposal satisfies SEC rules. EMC is exploring all its options."" In an interview, Chevedden called the rulings ""overwhelmingly positive.""

12,"   By Leila Abboud and Gwénaëlle Barzic | PARIS  PARIS Advertising agency Publicis, which is merging with larger rival Omnicom, achieved 3.3 percent revenue growth on a comparable basis in the first quarter, helped by strong digital sales and an uptick in China and Europe.Publicis, the first major ad group to post results for the period, said revenue was 1.6 billion euros ($2.21 billion). The average estimate of analysts was 1.62 billion and organic growth of 3 percent, according to company-provided figures.Chief Executive Maurice Levy said he was optimistic that the Omnicom deal, which will create the world's biggest ad group ahead of current leader WPP, would close in the third quarter once final antitrust approval was secured in China.Levy also confirmed Publicis' annual goals for organic sales growth of more than 4 percent and improved operating margins, adding that first-quarter margins were ""slightly better"", without providing a comparable 2013 figure.""Organic growth will not accelerate in the second quarter because of tough comparables, but it will in the third quarter,"" he said.

Market researcher Zenith Optimedia, owned by Publicis, has forecast ad spending will grow 5.5 percent this year, up from 3.9 percent in 2013, helped by the Winter Olympics in Russia, the soccer World Cup in Brazil, and U.S. mid-term elections.Much of the growth is coming from advertising online and on mobile phones - areas where Publicis is strong - while spending on marketing in magazines and newspapers continues to decline.PICKUP Publicis, which had been trailing rivals' growth in recent quarters because of weak performance in emerging markets, turned things around in the first quarter after meager growth of 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter.China, the third-biggest ad market globally behind the United States and Japan, swung from a 10.8 percent drop in sales in the fourth quarter to 0.2 percent growth. The luxury sector in China - a big market for Publicis - has been hard hit by a government crackdown on graft and an effort to curb gift-giving to public officials.In Europe, organic growth stood at 2.1 percent, with variations persisting between countries. Germany saw 10 percent growth, Italy and Spain returned to growth for the first time since 2011, and Britain slipped 1.6 percent because of what Levy described as delayed spending by some customers.North America's organic sales growth was 4.3 percent.Despite brighter growth prospects, investors have sent Publicis and WPP shares lower this year over concerns about profit margins and the impact of currency fluctuations. In February, WPP lowered its 2014 margin target to 0.3 points of growth, excluding the impact of currency swings, which could still take a toll on the group if sterling rises against emerging market currencies.Levy sought to calm investor concerns by repeating a pledge to improve operating margins this year and saying he was ""not very worried"" about the currency issue because of recent signals from Mario Draghi, Europe's top central banker.Draghi said last week that any further strengthening of the euro would need to be met by looser monetary policy so as to ward off the threat of deflation.""Historically, Publicis does not do financial hedging to protect itself from currency effects because we have local costs and local revenues,"" explained Levy.""I think Draghi has the means to act and that he will do so if he thinks countries are trying to regain competitive edge with monetary policy.""Publicis shares closed at 63.05 euros on Wednesday, down 5.2 percent this year, compared with a 5.9 percent increase in the Omnicom share price.

15,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Omnicom Group Inc (OMC.N), the No. 1 U.S. advertising company, said it was unable to predict when its $35.1 billion merger with France's Publicis Groupe SA (PUBP.PA) would close as the deal was yet to win some key approvals.Omnicom's shares fell as much as 3.6 percent in early trade.""At this point it's not practical to predict exactly when the transaction will close,"" Chief Executive John Wren said on Tuesday after the company reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue.Omnicom, which in October expected the merger to close in early 2014, said in February that the deal was likely to close ""a little bit into the third quarter"".The company said it was yet to receive approval from antitrust authorities in China and for establishing tax residency in the United Kingdom.Wren said if the companies were unable to obtain the tax residency approvals, ""it could affect the likelihood of satisfaction of the conditions to closing of our deal.""Any major tax implication for investors could be a potential deal breaker as both companies are trying to make the merger tax-free for their shareholders, Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich told Reuters.""I think there's definitely some additional doubt cast on the deal getting done,"" she added.The tax residency will have to be approved by the revenue and customs authority in the United Kingdom and the finance ministry of the Netherlands, where the new company will be headquartered.

Those things are requirements to get to a closing,"" Wren said.Omnicom, which owns agencies such as BBDO Worldwide and Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, warned that it would need to withdraw and resubmit its filings if China's regulator was unable to resolve all questions by June 16.HIGHER U.S. SPENDING Omnicom and closest U.S. rival Interpublic Group of Cos (IPG.N) reported better-than-expected revenue for the first quarter, mainly due to higher ad spending in their home market. Revenue from the United States grew 4 percent for Omnicom and 5 percent for Interpublic.Interpublic, which owns McCann Erickson and Draftfcb, reported a 7.7 percent rise in international revenue, as well as its first quarter of growth in Continental Europe in over two years. International revenue had declined in the prior three quarters.""We saw solid contributions from across our agency portfolio, with strength in the U.S., as well as significant growth in Latin America and Asia,"" Interpublic Chief Executive Michael Roth said in a statement.Omnicom's total revenue rose 3 percent to $3.50 billion, and reported net profit available for common shareholders of $201.4 million, or 77 cents per share. Excluding merger expenses, the company earned 80 cents per share.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 79 cents per share on revenue of $3.48 billion, according to Thomson ReutersI/B/E/S. Interpublic's revenue rose 6.1 percent to $1.64 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.60 billion.Interpublic reported a smaller-than-expected loss attributable to common shareholders of $20.9 million, or 5 cents per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 8 cents per share.Omnicom said organic growth increased revenue by 4.3 percent.Interpublic reported a 6.6 percent rise in organic revenue and said it remained ""well-positioned to meet or exceed"" its 2014 target of 3 to 4 percent organic growth and operating margin of 10.3 percent or better.Omnicom's shares were down 1.35 percent at $70.52 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday, while Interpublic's shares were up 4.2 percent at $17.57.(Reporting by Sruthi Ramakrishnan in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",2014-04-22,OMC,"Tue Apr 22, 2014 | 12:11pm EDT",Omnicom unable to say when Publicis merger will close,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-interpublic-results-idUSBREA3L0TG20140422?type=companyNews

18,"   By Tom Bergin and Pamela Barbaglia | LONDON  LONDON International pressure to curb corporate tax avoidance is behind delays to a $35 billion merger of French advertising group Publicis and U.S. rival Omnicom, and could even scupper the deal, tax advisers and sources close to the deal said.Last July, Paris-based Publicis and New York-headquartered Omnicom announced plans to create the world's biggest advertising group. The new company would be registered in the Netherlands and tax resident in the UK.However, on Wednesday Omnicom Chief Executive John Wren said the Dutch and British tax authorities had, ""unexpectedly"" so far failed to approve the arrangements, which Omnicom said last year would save $80 million a year in taxes. Wren added that if the UK and the Netherlands did not approve the structure, the whole deal was at risk since ""there is no Plan B"", though Publicis said on Thursday it was confident the deal would still proceed.Securities analysts said they were blindsided by the problems, and one source close to the deal said that an anti-tax avoidance strategy being pushed by the Group of 20 most powerful economies was making it more difficult to get such approvals.Tax advisers with experience of putting similar deals together said that historically the Dutch and UK tax authorities had been flexible in approving such a structure. This is because it would not mean a loss in tax for either the UK or the Netherlands, given that the two companies' headquarters are currently in the U.S. and France.Indeed, the arrangement would traditionally be welcomed by the UK and the Netherlands because it would likely bring in some tax revenue and support jobs.But a second source close to the deal said the two tax authorities had not reacted as expected.""Tax authorities are not working together to find a solution. They are fighting rather than cooperating and lack of cooperation between the UK and Dutch authorities is endangering the deal,"" the source said, adding there was a real risk the deal could collapse as a result.And the other source said the G-20's anti-tax avoidance strategy, known as the ""Base Erosion, Profit Shifting"" (BEPS) program, which is being managed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD), was having an impact on the deal.""The entire current BEPS discussion is getting a lot of attention from the Dutch Ministry of Finance, and in the UK, "" the source said. ""Things now take longer,"" he added. PUBLIC, PEER PRESSURE The Dutch and British tax authorities declined to comment on the Publicis-Omnicom case, citing rules on taxpayer confidentiality.But a spokesman for Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, the British tax authority, added: ""The UK is committed to tackling aggressive tax planning and harmful tax practices and is actively engaged in the OECD's work to look at the international tax rules, which have not kept pace with the changing nature of business"".Omnicom and Publicis did not return calls seeking further comment on the hurdles the deal was facing.Lawyers who have previously worked with companies moving their domiciles said tax authorities were beginning to take a less flexible approach when asked to approve tax-reduction structures. They said that this was a response to public anger over such moves, and the resulting political impetus for the authorities to crack down, as well as the proliferation of tax maneuvers.Ton Smit, a lawyer with Tax Consultants International in Amsterdam, said ""treaty shopping"" through which companies chose to establish only a nominal presence in a country to receive the tax-reduction benefits of tax treaties were facing a public backlash. ""The public is quite negative about the Post Office box company market,"" he said.Peer pressure was also at play, with countries such as the Netherlands or the UK not wanting to be seen to be helping big companies avoid taxes in allies such as the United States, said Dominic Stuttaford, tax partner with Norton Rose Fulbright in London.""The UK tax authority is very receptive to inward investment but they also want to make sure that people are not simply exploiting the tax regime,"" he said. ""The Dutch tax authority won't want the U.S. tax authority saying they are not doing their bit to make sure multinational companies are paying their fair share of tax,"" he added.The UK and Dutch tax authorities declined to comment on whether they have changed their approach.EFFICIENT STRUCTURE  The corporate structure planned by Publicis and Omnicom echoes that used when CNH and Fiat Industrial merged to create CNH Industrial in 2013.Italian carmaker Fiat and its U.S.-based affiliate Chrysler also plan to use a similar structure as part of the full integration of the two companies, due to be completed this year.The arrangement gives companies the chance to take advantage of Britain's unusual absence of a withholding tax on dividends, Stuttaford said.Being a UK tax resident is better than Dutch residency for companies with significant U.S. activities because the U.S.-UK tax treaty is seen as more beneficial than the U.S.-Netherlands tax treaty.Meanwhile, a Netherlands domicile can be more helpful as Dutch corporate rules permit anti-takeover provisions not allowed in the UK and offer more flexible rules on corporate governance matters, lawyers said.Normally a company is assumed to be tax resident in the country where it is registered but bilateral tax treaties often allow a company with no activities in the country of registration but activities in another to shift its tax residence to the second country.Yet in the case of the UK-Netherlands tax treaty, this is not a simple box-ticking exercise. Changes in the treaty in recent years, mean the tax authorities now have to go through a ""mutual agreement procedure"" before a Dutch-registered company can be deemed to be tax resident in Britain, and not the Netherlands.Tax advisors said they prefer the traditional box-ticking, which is also known as a ""tie-breaker"", as the mutual agreement can take more than six months to negotiate.""With a tie-breaker, you have your destiny in your hands,"" said one lawyer who asked not to be named.(Additional reporting by Leila Abboud in Paris, Nicola Leske in New York and Anjuli Davies in London; Editing by Martin Howell)",2014-04-24,OMC,"Thu Apr 24, 2014 | 7:38pm EDT",Insight: Push for tax-avoidance curbs in G-20 threatens Publicis-Omnicom deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-omnicom-group-publicis-groupe-tax-ins-idUSBREA3N2IS20140424?type=companyNews

22,"  April 25 A merger of Omnicom Group Inc, the No.1 U.S. advertising company, and French rival Publicis Groupe SA has hit a roadblock following disagreements over terms of the deal, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday, citing people with knowledge of the situation.Last July, both companies announced the proposed $35 billion merger that would overtake WPP Plc as the world's largest advertising company.The companies have essentially not agreed on who will be the legal acquirer, which is delaying crucial paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, according to the report.Despite both companies owning 50 percent of the new entity, technically one has to acquire the other for accounting reasons.Omnicom and Publicis have stopped meetings of about 70 integration committees, where they present their networks, teams, organization, the Journal said, citing sources. (link.reuters.com/nax78v) The companies are also unable to agree on the filling of senior posts in the to-be-created advertising behemoth, particularly the position of chief financial officer.Omnicom wants its finance chief Randall Weisenburger to be the new CFO of the merged entity, while Publicis is backing CFO Jean-Michel Etienne for the job, the Journal reported.Omnicom and Publicis could not be reached for comment outside regular business hours in the United States and France. The instability surrounding the merger has benefited rival WPP, which posted a much better-than-expected first-quarter revenue growth on Friday, helped by a surge in new clients linked to the merger.""I think the best result for us, frankly, would be for the deal to go ahead with joint CEOs, you know, fighting with one another about who's running the company,"" WPP chief Martin Sorrell said in a Reuters Insider interview following the results. Sorrell said that people he spoke with have said there's a third to 50 percent probability that the deal will not go through.Legal and tax issues are also adding to the conflicts related to the merger. Omnicom on Tuesday said it was unable to predict when the deal would close, following uncertainty over approval from antitrust authorities in China, a big market for Publicis, and for establishing tax residency in the United Kingdom.Both companies will have to get approvals from the revenue and customs authority in the United Kingdom and the finance ministry of the Netherlands, where the new British company will be headquartered.Tax approval from France is also pending, Omnicom has said.

23,"   By Leila Abboud and Tom Bergin | PARIS/LONDON  PARIS/LONDON The chief executives of advertising companies Publicis (PUBP.PA) and Omnicom Group (OMC.N) are working together to resolve a seven-month-old struggle over who will be chief financial officer of their combined group if the $35 billion merger is completed, three people close to the deal said on Sunday.John Wren, the head of New York-based Omnicom, and Maurice Levy, his opposite number at Paris-based Publicis, are in regular contact to try to settle the CFO choice, which has fuelled tensions between the two sides since September as they seek to secure regulatory approvals for the blockbuster deal, the people said.Both remain committed to the tie-up, which would create the world's biggest ad agency ahead of current leader WPP (WPP.L), added the sources.The infighting over the CFO shows the pitfalls of trying to engineer a ""merger of equals"" as the deal was billed when it was announced to much fanfare in July.Some analysts, investors and rivals have expressed doubts over whether executives and staff in the two companies, especially their veteran CEOs, will be able to effectively work together if the deal is completed. Other mergers with similar profiles, including a 2006 Franco-American tie-up between telecom equipment makers Alcatel ALUA.PA and Lucent Technologies, have foundered over culture clashes.The CEO of rival WPP, Martin Sorrell, said on Friday that most people he was speaking to said there was now a third to a half chance that the deal would not be completed.The tensions between the top executives of the two companies were first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Friday.The merger calls for a 50-50 ownership split of the equity in the new company, Publicis Omnicom Group, with Wren and Levy serving as co-CEOs for 30 months from the closing.The two companies initially aimed to close the deal in the first quarter of this year, but an ongoing China antitrust review and tax jurisdiction issues that were disclosed by Omnicom last Tuesday have delayed completion. Publicis said last week that the deal would close in the third quarter, but Omnicom's Wren now declines to predict timing.Omnicom wants its CFO, Randall Weisenburger, to get the top finance job, while Publicis wants its CFO, Jean-Michel Etienne, the people said. PROFIT MARGIN QUESTION Behind the spat over the group's finance chief is a deeper question about how the new operation should be run, said two of the people.To boost profits, Publicis has long centralized many purchasing and support functions for the roughly dozen advertising agencies it owns, such as Saatchi & Saatchi, Leo Burnett and Razorfish. Analysts say the approach has helped Publicis achieve higher operating profit margins than its rivals; its margin stood at 15.9 percent last year, compared with 12.5 percent for Omnicom and 15.1 percent for WPP.The choice of the CFO could determine whether the new company adopts the Publicis approach or the more decentralized model favored by Omnicom in which individual agencies have more leeway in everything from technology systems to supplies, the people said.""There are ongoing talks on the leadership issue,"" said one of the people on Sunday. ""Wren and Levy are determined to find a solution because it is simply in the interests of both companies. The best guarantee of success is the two CEOs determination to complete the deal.""The companies also continue to work on resolving tax issues that have slowed down the deal. Wren spooked investors on Tuesday when he disclosed that the companies had not yet been able to get approval for their plan to have a tax residency in Britain, while being legally headquartered in the Netherlands. Although the British tax authorities sent a positive signal in meetings with the companies over the new entity being tax resident in Britain, the Dutch authorities were not supportive, two of the people said. The Dutch rejected the idea that the new company could be legally based in that country but not be subject to local tax rules.""The Dutch authorities expressed a desire not to lose their tax sovereignty over the new company to the English,"" said one of the people.One option to solve the problem might be to seek double residency for tax purposes in both Britain and the Netherlands, which is rare but may be workable, the person added.Publicis and Omnicom continue to work on the issue. The Dutch and the British would have to agree for Omnicom and Publicis' original British tax residency plan to become a reality.Another approval needed from France's tax authority is on track and not expected to pose a problem, the sources said. OTHER SIGNS OF TENSION Besides the tussle to name the finance chief, there are other signs that relations between the two companies are fraying.They have not been able to agree on which company will be listed as the ""accounting acquirer"", or the buyer from an accounting standpoint, on official filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While the issue is a technicality, it has gotten tangled up in the CFO fight, one of the people said.Usually in an acquisition, the accounting acquirer is the party receiving the bigger share of the equity and voting rights in the new company. In the Omnicom-Publicis deal both sides are due to receive an equal stake and voting rights in the new company, so a series of criteria must be analyzed to determine which side is the accounting acquirer.Robert Willens, a corporate tax and accounting analyst based in New York, said the dispute over accounting acquirer pointed to a disagreement over management control.""That could be symptomatic of other, more deep-seated conflicts between the companies,"" he said.WPP's Sorrell said he would prefer the deal go ahead because in his view mergers of equals don't work.

26,"   By Kate Holton, Jennifer Saba and Leila Abboud | LONDON/NEW YORK/PARIS  LONDON/NEW YORK/PARIS Publicis and Omnicom have lost more than $1.5 billion of client work in recent weeks and face a fight to retain billions more, including a huge Samsung contract, just as the two advertising firms struggle to keep their merger on track.When the world's second and third-largest ad groups announced a merger last July, it sparked talk from rivals, led by Martin Sorrell, the boss of current leader London-based WPP, that the U.S. and French firms could lose clients and talented staff as a result.Now, with the deal's closing delayed at least six months because of regulatory issues, and relations so tense between the two that they haven't been able to solve a seven-month dispute over who becomes new finance chief, Sorrell has been boasting about being successful in winning business from them and poaching their staff.Several large contracts, including Vodafone's $1 billion global media and buying account, moved hands from Omnicom to WPP in April.On Wednesday, Microsoft announced it was moving its multibillion-dollar ad and media business from Publicis and WPP to Japan's Dentsu Aegis and U.S. Interpublic. Others to move away from Publicis or Omnicom in recent weeks include food maker Danone, pharma group GSK, electronics firm Sony, and retailer Marks & Spencer.In the ad business, accounts do change hands quite regularly - in the case of some companies every few years - and there are often reviews and pitches for the business when contracts come to the end of their terms. Also, none of the clients who have jumped ship have publicly blamed the merger.Omnicom CFO Randall Weisenburger noted on an earnings call last week that swings in the business, such as the Vodafone loss, are quite normal. ""Each quarter you get one or two big wins or one or two big losses,"" he said.And the wins are not all in WPP's favor. Publicis prevailed against WPP on a contract with food company ConAgra in February and its BBH agency expanded its role with British Airways at the expense of WPP's Ogilvy in March.Nevertheless Publicis and Omnicom face the unenviable task of defending contracts, including the multibillion dollar account of tech giant Samsung and the U.S. account of the leading brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, maker of Budweiser beer, amid questions about whether the merger plan will fall apart.Among any client's biggest concerns will be whether they get the attention and quality of service they want from staff and management who will be wondering if the merger will happen and what lies ahead for them whether it goes ahead or not. Critical is whether there will be changes in the ad agency teams they work with, consultants, analysts, and rival ad executives said.""There is more than $4 billion in review for the combined company counting major accounts like Samsung that could change hands,"" Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said. ""Publicis and Omnicom lost contracts worth $1.5 billion from four accounts in one week in April,"" he said. ""It's somewhat bad luck on timing, but does raise some questions as to if it's more than bad luck.""CHAMPAGNE TOASTS As they feted the deal signing with champagne in Paris last summer, Omnicom CEO 's John Wren and Publicis' CEO Maurice Levy said their ""merger of equals"" would enable them to better compete with the likes of Google and Facebook who dominate the digital ad space, which accounts for nearly a quarter of global marketing spend.Greater scale was supposed to give the new group better bargaining power in buying space for ads on TV, the web, and print at a time when many global brands are looking to cut costs on advertising.But uncertainty over the deal grew last week after the two CEOs gave different reasons for the closing's delay.The deal still requires various regulatory approvals, including antitrust approval in China, and agreement from European authorities to a structure that would see the merged company have its domicile in the Netherlands and tax residency in the UK. The two sides are also locked in a dispute over who should be chief financial officer. Whoever takes the CFO role will determine how the new company will operate, hewing either to Publicis' centralized structure or Omnicom's less controlling approach to subsidiaries.Still, some experts said that the merger of the two holding companies wasn't a big issue for many clients.Judy Neer, president and CEO of Pile and Company, a consulting firm that helps companies with their marketing relationships, said many of her clients weren't concerned about the merger provided it didn't impact the specific ad agency subsidiaries they deal with.One insider at Omnicom acknowledged that the deal had not been useful as a tool to recruit clients, but nor were clients citing it as a reason for reviewing contracts either.A person familiar with the thinking of one big consumer brand which recently moved its global account from Publicis to WPP said it had not been put off by the merger, but that WPP had offered more attractive and efficient terms.Another person at a multinational which recently moved its media buying account from Omnicom to WPP, said Omnicom had in recent months failed to maintain the relationship, that WPP was better in certain areas including digital, and that the company couldn't see the benefits to the Omnicom-Publicis merger. ""No one explained what synergies were in it for us,"" the person said.POACHING TALENT One of the biggest accounts to come up for grabs in recent years is the creative, digital and media business of Samsung Electronics. Starcom MediaVest Group and Leo Burnett, units of Publicis, currently have much of the work with other agencies doing parts.According to Ad Age, Samsung spent $4.35 billion on advertising in 2012. Exane BNP analyst Charles Bedouelle said the account could be worth around 2 percent of Publicis revenues and said the review indicates how big companies are consolidating their work across countries and sectors as they look to save on costs. ""WPP excels at this game,"" he said citing the firm's size and structure.Other battlegrounds expected include Spain's Telefonica, which is reviewing some $300 million in advertising contracts, most of which are now with Publicis.WPP had the highest rate of comparable revenue growth of the big four agencies in the first quarter, with the fourth-largest IPG in second place, Omnicom third and Publicis fourth.Retaining talent is also a worry for Publicis and Omnicom.WPP's Sorrell has said that for every one member of staff he has lost to the merging group, his firm has attracted four in return. Both IPG boss Michael Roth and Yannick Bollore, head of the fifth-biggest ad group Havas, said they had seen opportunities to lure staff away from the two. Havas recently won an account from Gulf airline Emirates from Publicis.""Six months ago or four months ago, I was receiving resumes from young executives,"" Bollore told an analyst conference call on March 20. ""Now for the last two or three weeks, I don't know if something happened inside Publicis-Omnicom, but I'm starting to receive some resumes from very high senior managers.""Still Omnicom's Wren said on the firm's earnings call last week that its talent base is ""very stable"" and pointed to a recent big hire: Peter Sherman, Omnicom's new executive vice president, who left WPP'S JWT Worldwide.(Editing by Martin Howell)",2014-05-01,OMC,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 7:05am EDT","Rivals poach Publicis, Omnicom clients, staff as merger faces snags",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-publicis-groupe-omnicom-group-clients-idUSBREA4000D20140501?type=companyNews

28,"  (Repeating to additional subscribers)* Merger delayed by tax, regulatory approvals* Publicis, Omnicom lost a string of contracts in April* Big Samsung contract also under review* Rivals seek to poach firms' top talentBy Kate Holton, Jennifer Saba and Leila AbboudLONDON/NEW YORK/PARIS, May 1 Publicis  and Omnicom have lost more than $1.5 billion of client work in recent weeks and face a fight to retain billions more, including a huge Samsung contract, just as the two advertising firms struggle to keep their merger on track.When the world's second and third-largest ad groups announced a merger last July, it sparked talk from rivals, led by Martin Sorrell, the boss of current leader London-based WPP , that the U.S. and French firms could lose clients and talented staff as a result.Now, with the deal's closing delayed at least six months because of regulatory issues, and relations so tense between the two that they haven't been able to solve a seven-month dispute over who becomes new finance chief, Sorrell has been boasting about being successful in winning business from them and poaching their staff.Several large contracts, including Vodafone's $1 billion global media and buying account, moved hands from Omnicom to WPP in April.On Wednesday, Microsoft announced it was moving its multibillion-dollar ad and media business from Publicis and WPP to Japan's Dentsu Aegis and U.S. Interpublic. Others to move away from Publicis or Omnicom in recent weeks include food maker Danone, pharma group GSK, electronics firm Sony, and retailer Marks & Spencer.In the ad business, accounts do change hands quite regularly - in the case of some companies every few years - and there are often reviews and pitches for the business when contracts come to the end of their terms. Also, none of the clients who have jumped ship have publicly blamed the merger.Omnicom CFO Randall Weisenburger noted on an earnings call last week that swings in the business, such as the Vodafone loss, are quite normal. ""Each quarter you get one or two big wins or one or two big losses,"" he said.And the wins are not all in WPP's favour. Publicis prevailed against WPP on a contract with food company ConAgra in February and its BBH agency expanded its role with British Airways at the expense of WPP's Ogilvy in March. Nevertheless Publicis and Omnicom face the unenviable task of defending contracts, including the multibillion dollar account of tech giant Samsung and the U.S. account of the leading brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev,  maker of Budweiser beer, amid questions about whether the merger plan will fall apart.Among any client's biggest concerns will be whether they get the attention and quality of service they want from staff and management who will be wondering if the merger will happen and what lies ahead for them whether it goes ahead or not. Critical is whether there will be changes in the ad agency teams they work with, consultants, analysts, and rival ad executives said.""There is more than $4 billion in review for the combined company counting major accounts like Samsung that could change hands,"" Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser said.""Publicis and Omnicom lost contracts worth $1.5 billion from four accounts in one week in April,"" he said.

34,"   By Anjuli Davies, Soyoung Kim and Leila Abboud | LONDON/NEW YORK/PARIS  LONDON/NEW YORK/PARIS The $35-billion merger of U.S.-based Omnicom and France's Publicis collapsed on Friday after a battle for control destroyed plans to create the world's largest advertising agency.The deal, heralded in July as a merger of equals that would enable the two agencies to compete more effectively in the digital arena, foundered on issues ranging from its complex tax structure to the firms' divergent cultures.The two sides were also losing major work - more than $1.5 billion in the past month alone - and did not want to let the uncertainty continue.""I have not been able to convince John that balance is balance,"" Publicis Chief Executive Maurice Levy said of his Omnicom counterpart, John Wren.""Omnicom wanted their people to fill the CEO, CFO and general counsel jobs,"" he told Reuters. ""I thought that went too far. I was not ready to cede on this point.""For his part, Wren said the two sides had failed to find a way past the strong corporate cultures that existed in each company.""There was no one factor,"" Wren, 61, told Reuters.""There are a lot of complex issues we haven't resolved. There are strong corporate cultures in both companies that delayed us for reaching an agreement. There was no clear finish line in sight, and uncertainty is never a good thing when you are in the personal service business.""On a conference call with analysts and reporters on Friday, Wren summed up the broken deal with a nod to Twitter: ""If I had to summarize in a tweet it would be, corporate culture, complexity and time. And I would still have 100 characters left.""Two people familiar with the situation said relations between the two sides began to unravel in December, with tensions simmering between Levy and Wren, and the Frenchman believing the deal was turning into a takeover rather than a merger.One person said the men met two weeks ago to agree what to do.The key dispute over who should be chief financial officer would have influenced whether the new company inclined towards a centralized structure to manage costs, which Publicis argues has driven its higher margins, or Omnicom's more devolved approach.Neither company will pay a termination fee, and they will split the costs of the failed deal, such as legal fees. With the deal off the cards, analysts predicted a period of turmoil ahead for the industry as Publicis and Omnicom seek to re-engage with clients after recent business losses.Wren disputed that Omnicom lost clients because of the merger, saying it was ""absolutely not true.""One global consultant who advises clients on media spend told Reuters that agencies within Martin Sorrell's WPP, which will keep its crown as the world's largest advertising agency, had won a lot of work of late by cutting fees.He advised existing clients of Publicis and Omnicom to use the uncertainty to negotiate better terms. He noted that some client work coming up for review in the coming months would also pit agencies owned by the two firms against each other.Publicis shares were down almost 1 percent, while Britain's WPP was flat. Omnicom was down 0.3 percent. Smaller French player Havas, seen as a takeover target, jumped 3.4 percent.""We see the consequences for the agency space as negative as, shorter-term, it is likely to lead to a more competitive environment and, longer-term, it dashes the hopes that the merger would lead to an easing of pressures in staff costs and client fees,"" wrote Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker.Some analysts also said further deals could crop up involving perhaps fourth-largest agency Interpublic and Japanese advertising group Dentsu. SOAP OPERA Sorrell told Reuters the failure of the deal had turned into a soap opera.""You now have the charade of them trying to say we're just as well off apart as we were together, which begs the question of why spend a couple of hundred million dollars to prove that being together didn't work.

35,"  (Corrects paragraph 3 to show Omnicom CEO as John Wren, not John Levy)* Merger of equals founders over power struggle - Levy* Tax, regulatory issues had held up closing* Analysts see tougher times, M&A ahead for ad sectorBy Anjuli Davies, Soyoung Kim and Leila AbboudLONDON/NEW YORK/PARIS May 9 The $35 billion merger of U.S.-based Omnicom and France's Publicis  collapsed on Friday after a battle for control destroyed plans to create the world's largest advertising agency.The deal, heralded in July as a merger of equals that would enable the two agencies to compete more effectively in the digital arena, foundered on issues ranging from its complex tax structure to the firms' divergent cultures. The two sides were also losing major work - more than $1.5 billion in the past month alone - and did not want to let the uncertainty continue.""I have not been able to convince John that balance is balance,"" Publicis Chief Executive Maurice Levy said of his Omnicom counterpart John Wren.""Omnicom wanted their people to fill the CEO, CFO and general counsel jobs,"" he told Reuters. ""I thought that went too far. I was not ready to cede on this point.""For his part, Wren said the two sides had failed to find a way past the strong corporate cultures that existed in each company.""There was no one factor,"" Wren, 61, told Reuters.""There are a lot of complex issues we haven't resolved. There are strong corporate cultures in both companies that delayed us for reaching an agreement. There was no clear finish line in sight, and uncertainty is never a good thing when you are in the personal service business.""Two people familiar with the situation said relations between the two sides had started to unravel in December, with tensions starting to develop between Levy and Wren, and the Frenchman believing that the deal was turning into a takeover rather than a merger. One person said the men met two weeks ago to agree what to do.The key dispute over who should be CFO would have influenced whether the new company inclined towards a centralised structure to manage costs, which Publicis argues has driven its higher margins, or Omnicom's more devolved approach.Neither company will pay a termination fee, and they will split the costs of the failed deal, such as legal fees.With the deal off the cards, analysts predicted a period of turmoil ahead for the industry as Publicis and Omnicom seek to re-engage with clients after recent business losses.One global consultant who advises clients on media spend told Reuters that agencies within Martin Sorrell's WPP, which will keep its crown as the world's largest advertising agency, had won a lot of work of late by cutting fees.He advised existing clients of Publicis and Omnicom to use the uncertainty to negotiate better terms. He noted that some client work coming up for review in the coming months would also pitch agencies owned by the two firms against each other.Publicis shares were down almost 1 percent, while Britain's WPP was flat. Smaller French player Havas, seen as a takeover target, jumped 3.4 percent. ""We see the consequences for the agency space as negative as, shorter-term, it is likely to lead to a more competitive environment and, longer-term, it dashes the hopes that the merger would lead to an easing of pressures in staff costs and client fees,"" wrote Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker.Some analysts also said further deals could crop up involving perhaps fourth-largest agency Interpublic and Japanese advertising group Dentsu.SOAP OPERA Sorrell told Reuters the failure of the deal had turned into a soap opera.""You now have the charade of them trying to say we're just as well off apart as we were together, which begs the question of why spend a couple of hundred million dollars to prove that being together didn't work. It was ill thought through."" Although Levy still believes Publicis should be bigger to cope with the way technology is changing the ad business, he demurred on whether the group needed a big acquisition.""For now, our goal is simple - to accelerate our strategic plan,"" he said.Publicis and Omnicom had justified the marriage as a way to provide scale and capital to cope with technological forces reshaping the industry.Wren and Levy, who toasted the tie-up with champagne in Paris last summer, had said it would enable them to better compete with the likes of Google Inc and Facebook Inc , which dominate digital advertising, an area that accounts for nearly a quarter of global marketing spending.The planned merger had called for a 50-50 ownership split of the equity in the new company, Publicis Omnicom Group, with Wren and Levy serving as co-CEOs for 30 months from the closing.Signs of trouble between Omnicom and Publicis appeared in late April when Wren disclosed hurdles to getting the deal's tax structure approved by regulators in Europe.

42,"   By Jennifer Saba, Kate Holton and Pamela Barbaglia | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON The collapse of the $35 billion merger of New York-based Omnicom with France's Publicis is likely to lead the world's biggest ad agencies to think small as they try to counter the challenge from internet giants like Google.Since announcing their merger last July, executives from the two firms touted the creation of the world's biggest ad agency as the best way to gain scale and capital to compete on price and invest in technology as clients squeeze the agencies on cost.One of the prime motivations for the deal was the competition coming from a host of rivals ranging from Google and Facebook, software companies Oracle and Salesforce and consulting firms Accenture and IBM, which are siphoning off business that traditionally belonged to ad firms.After this week's break-up, which was due in large part to a clash of cultures and egos, the two firms need to rethink their approach. Bankers and industry executives say buying smaller ad technology companies may be their best bet to capture the billions of dollars flowing toward digital advertising.""You have two massive organizations that singularly focused their future on a combination of scale to deliver better costs and that is not going to happen now,"" said Dave Morgan, the chief executive of Simulmedia, a firm that sells TV advertising. He pointed to recent deals by Google and AOL focused on small ad technology companies that provide analytics.Greater scale was supposed to give the new Omnicom-Publicis group better bargaining power in buying space for ads on TV, the internet, and print at a time when many global brands are looking to cut costs on advertising.That rationale was never completely clear, one major Omnicom client told Reuters. And with the promised increase in scale no longer an option, the two firms have to explain to their clients what they can offer instead.NEED FOR INSIGHT One thing they need to provide is greater insight on what works and how cost effective ads are, especially in digital advertising, ad executives and analysts say.Consumers now interact with media in a host of different ways, from the traditional sources of TV, radio, billboards and newspapers, to the different offerings online and on mobile including basic portals and social networks.That has forced ad agencies and clients to change how they value the influence of an ad. A consumer seeing a traditional TV commercial may then go online to search for a deal before eventually buying the product in a store some time later, having been reminded of it by a nearby billboard. With so many moving parts, the ad agencies have turned to data analytics to better understand and predict the behavior of consumers.It is the need for such insight that has put them on a collision course with the big internet and software companies.But Brian Wieser, senior research analyst at Pivotal, believes there is room for both to operate within the industry.""Marketing services and technology are becoming increasingly interchangeable,"" he said adding there is still room for growth since more services are needed given the fragmented media landscape.Jeff Lanctot, president and CEO of Mixpo, a company that helps companies create video ads, said the need for scale had actually decreased in recent years as digital advertising - which accounts for nearly a quarter of global marketing spend - used real-time auctions to buy media space.""Buying power has been the real pitch from the holding companies,"" he said. ""I think what is the better approach is to get much more aggressive in technology acquisitions."" SMALL BITES Two relatively small deals announced in the last week could be a sign of things to come.AOL, which has been investing in automated exchanges where machines buy and sell digital advertising, said this week it would pay $101 million to buy Convertro Inc, a platform that helps advertisers manage spending budgets across different media.On the same day Google announced it was acquiring Adometry, which offers the ability to understand the influence that different marketing tools have on consumer decisions.One sector banker pointed to providers of retargeting - which shows ads of a certain brand to consumers who have already visited that brand's site - and data analytics for advertisers as Publicis' best bet to rebound.He named Next Performance in France, Struq in the UK and myThings in Israel as the most promising sector players under the 100 million euro revenue threshold. ""These companies are getting a lot of attention. The industry will now prioritize smaller deals that bring real strategic value to investors,"" a sector adviser said.Publicly traded marketing analytics providers such as France's Criteo, which uses tracking technology to target ads at consumers surfing the web, and Rocket Fuel, which applies big data analysis to digital advertising, are seen as other promising takeover candidates for the big groups.WPP'S DIGITAL ACQUISITIONS One of the most prolific acquirer of digital groups is Martin Sorrell's WPP, which will now retain its position as the world's largest ad group.Uncharacteristically left on the sidelines last year, Sorrell wasted little time when the deal was announced in telling both his and his rivals' clients why it was doomed to fail. Having handled 46 billion pounds of billings in 2013, WPP, he said, offered scale and insight at the same time.Omnicom's CEO, John Wren, told investors on Friday that Omnicom was still in the market for acquisitions but stressed those would be small bites.His counterpart at Publicis, Maurice Levy, demurred on other big acquisitions on Friday during a call with investors.Shares in both IPG, the world's fourth largest ad group behind WPP, Omnicom and Publicis, and France's Havas, the fifth largest player, rose on Friday on hopes they too could be involved in some form of consolidation.Japan's Dentsu Inc is also seen as playing a role.Several agency CEOs and analysts said while they expected consolidation to happen, because the industry would forever be under pressure from clients to cut costs, following the Publicis-Omnicom debacle, small may be the order of the day.(Reporting by Jennifer Saba in New York, Kate Holton and Pamela Barbaglia in London; Editing by Frances Kerry)",2014-05-11,OMC,"Sun May 11, 2014 | 9:58am EDT","As big ad deal falls apart, firms start thinking small",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-omnicom-group-publicis-groupe-next-an-idUSBREA4A05520140511?type=companyNews
43,"   By Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Mergers of equals were largely dead long before ad giant Omnicom Group Inc struck its ill-fated $35 billion deal with rival Publicis Groupe SA.That didn't stop Publicis Chief Executive Officer Maurice Levy and Omnicom's John Wren from trying to sell the deal as just that to investors and employees, and won't stop other executives in the future, bankers and lawyers said.In fact, the Omnicom-Publicis deal's undoing may have been that how close it came to merging two equal companies - they negotiated terms such as 50-50 ownership for the two sets of shareholders with no premium paid to either, a co-CEO situation with Levy and Wren and equal board representation.It seemed so harmonious in Paris in July, when Wren and Levy toasted each other with Champagne under the Arc de Triomphe and posed for photographs in each other's embrace. Since then, the future co-CEOs bickered over who would fill key jobs such as chief financial officer, what would happen to Levy after Wren took over as sole CEO, and over such issues as the company's tax structure while combining the different cultures of a U.S. and a French company.With two people in charge and key issues left for later, it became clear that the hype didn't match reality: one company was actually trying to take over the other, and the company being taken over was Publicis.""The deal was gradually sliding from a merger of equals to a takeover and this is not what we had signed for,"" said a person close to Publicis last week. ""Maurice made it very clear from the beginning: Yes to a merger of equals, no to an acquisition.""For companies, there are substantial benefits to portraying the deals as mergers of equals, even though the outcome may not always be best for investors.For the buyer, such a portrayal can help reduce the premium they would have to pay. Steps such as giving the target significant board representation and a roughly 50-50 shareholder split in all-stock transactions shows that the seller's shareholders are not giving up all control, and so don't need to be paid as much for it. The average premium paid in deals globally that were billed as mergers of equals so far this year was 11.9 percent, compared with the average of 25.6 percent paid in other takeovers, according to Thomson Reuters data.For the seller, the benefits are mostly psychological.""I think a lot of it is to reassure the employees, the culture that they're used to, the organization they're used to, the people they report to even, isn't going to totally disappear,"" said Alan Klein, an M&A partner at law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.

44,"  (For more Reuters DEALTALKS, double click on )By Soyoung KimNEW YORK May 18 Mergers of equals were largely dead long before ad giant Omnicom Group Inc struck its ill-fated $35 billion deal with rival Publicis Groupe SA .That didn't stop Publicis Chief Executive Officer Maurice Levy and Omnicom's John Wren from trying to sell the deal as just that to investors and employees, and won't stop other executives in the future, bankers and lawyers said.In fact, the Omnicom-Publicis deal's undoing may have been that how close it came to merging two equal companies - they negotiated terms such as 50-50 ownership for the two sets of shareholders with no premium paid to either, a co-CEO situation with Levy and Wren and equal board representation.It seemed so harmonious in Paris in July, when Wren and Levy toasted each other with Champagne under the Arc de Triomphe and posed for photographs in each other's embrace. Since then, the future co-CEOs bickered over who would fill key jobs such as chief financial officer,, what would happen to Levy after Wren took over as sole CEO, and over such issues as the company's tax structure while combining the different cultures of a U.S. and a French company.With two people in charge and key issues left for later, it became clear that the hype didn't match reality: one company was actually trying to take over the other, and the company being taken over was Publicis.""The deal was gradually sliding from a merger of equals to a takeover and this is not what we had signed for,"" said a person close to Publicis last week. ""Maurice made it very clear from the beginning: Yes to a merger of equals, no to an acquisition.""For companies, there are substantial benefits to portraying the deals as mergers of equals, even though the outcome may not always be best for investors. For the buyer, such a portrayal can help reduce the premium they would have to pay. Steps such as giving the target significant board representation and a roughly 50-50 shareholder split in all-stock transactions shows that the seller's shareholders are not giving up all control, and so don't need to be paid as much for it.The average premium paid in deals globally that were billed as mergers of equals so far this year was 11.9 percent, compared with the average of 25.6 percent paid in other takeovers, according to Thomson Reuters data.For the seller, the benefits are mostly psychological.""I think a lot of it is to reassure the employees, the culture that they're used to, the organization they're used to, the people they report to even, isn't going to totally disappear,"" said Alan Klein, an M&A partner at law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.

European merger volume has already nearly doubled over the last year, according to Thomson Reuters data.But a string of botched takeovers in the past few weeks has made traders and investors more sceptical of the potential for M&A-fuelled share-price rewards - especially for big deals that carry increased political and execution risk.""The mega-deals are proving ever more difficult, as the politicians get involved,"" Rupert Baker, an equity sales executive at Mirabaud Securities, said.""I don't think we'll see any big deals for the next few months, and you could be in for a lull on the market.""There is a close correlation between markets and mergers.The pan-European STOXX 600 index is up by 5 percent since the start of 2014, helped by the resurgence of dealmaking, which typically pushes up the shares of takeover targets.Historically, the STOXX 600 has peaked alongside deal volumes. It hit a high of around 400 points in mid-2007 just as European M&A monthly volumes hit their highest since November 1999, before markets slumped as the 2008 financial crisis hit. This year's deal revival that has helped to drive stock markets higher has started to hit some big hurdles.Earlier this week, shares in drugmaker AstraZeneca  dropped after U.S. rival Pfizer walked away from making a formal bid for AstraZeneca potentially worth about $118 billion.The two companies had been locked in a month-long public fight over the proposed deal that sparked political concerns on both sides of the Atlantic over jobs and tax manoeuvres.Just days later, engineering group Weir dropped a bid for Metso after the Finnish company rejected a second, sweetened takeover offer.

49,"   By Alister, Doyle,, Environment and Correspondent | BONN, Germany  BONN, Germany The United States won praise at U.N. talks on climate change on Wednesday for its plan to cut carbon emissions, but a group of scientists said it too little to put the world on track to limit global warming.The European Union, which often says it is doing more than the United States to lead a fight against global warming, told the June 4-15 meeting of 170 nations that it would over-achieve its targets for cutting greenhouse gases by 2020.The United States outlined plans on Monday for the U.S. power sector to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels as part of regulations that will be the centrepiece of President Barack Obama's climate change strategy.""It is a really constructive first step,"" Prakash Mathema of Nepal, leading a group of 48 of the world's least developed countries, said of the U.S. plan. The Bonn talks are working on a U.N. deal to fight climate change, due to be agreed by late 2015 at a summit in Paris. But Mathema and other delegates said that far more U.S. action was needed to cut emissions of gases, mainly from burning fossil fuels, that are blamed by a U.N. panel of experts for causing more floods, droughts and rising sea levels. A group of scientists represented at the meeting said that all nations needed to do more to cut emissions and keep temperatures below a ceiling of 2 degrees (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times agreed by almost 200 nations in 2010. They said that Obama's plan was insufficient even to meet Washington's own goals for tackling climate change by the end of this decade, of a cut in greenhouse gas emissions of 17 percent below 2005 levels. ""Every little step has to be welcomed ... but this is not enough to get on a 2C pathway,"" Bill Hare of Climate Analytics told a news conference of the report issued with research partners Ecofys and the Pik Potsdam Institute. CHINESE CAP? Among other signs of action, an adviser to the Chinese government suggested on Tuesday that Beijing may impose a cap on its soaring emissions in coming years, a huge step for Beijing which has said it needs to burn more energy to end poverty. [ID:nL3N0OK3WX] Chinese delegates in Bonn declined comment.“With the EU, the U.S. and China there is a bit of jockeying for position,” said Alden Meyer, of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “None of them wants to be perceived as the laggard, which is a good thing."" Connie Hedegaard, the EU Climate Commissioner, said in a statement that ""the EU will substantially over-achieve"" its targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. EU cuts by 2020 would be 24.5 percent below 1990 levels, deeper than a minimum 20 percent target, and give a total over-achievement of 5.5 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases, she said in a statement based on data issued last month. [ID:nL6N0O06BG]Greek delegation leader Ioannis Ziomas, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, dismissed suggestions the EU was seeking to upstage the United States by touting EU successes. ""This is not a beauty contest,"" he said.The EU's emissions were 19 percent below 1990 levels in 2012 while U.S. emissions were up 4.3 percent, according to national data. China's emissions have more than tripled in the same period. Together, the three account for half of world emissions.

53,"   By Paul Sandle | CANNES FRANCE  CANNES FRANCE Publicis (PUBP.PA) boss Maurice Levy plans to shift the French advertising group more quickly and deeply into digital services following last month's collapse of his plan to merge with Omnicom (OMC.N) to create the world's largest ad agency. The 72-year-old Levy, chief executive for the past 27 years, finds himself having to regroup and rebuild investor confidence before he steps down next year. He told Reuters on Friday he would look to acquire smaller digital companies as well as increase the dividend. Later this year the company will start looking to find his successor.""I am 100 percent focused on the future. I am not very much interested in the past; it is the end of the story,"" he said of the failed merger. ""I am focusing on how we are going to sharpen our strategy.""Levy put the possibility of another merger on the scale of the Omnicom tie-up at ""zero"".The $35 billion deal would have created a group bigger than industry leader Britain's WPP (WPP.L) and better placed to compete with technology rivals such as Google (GOOG.O) and Facebook (FB.O). Levy and John Wren, his counterpart at U.S. giant Omnicom, had planned to share the CEO role for the first 30 months.But the deal, originally heralded as a merger of equals, fell apart last month as both sides fought to take control of the group. Levy admitted on Friday that cultural differences had become a real issue, while the companies had also realised they could not deliver the promised benefits to shareholders. The Frenchman denied however that the group had become distracted and rejected suggestions from his rival, WPP boss Martin Sorrell, that Publicis had lost work during the process. Sorrell, who has been a critic of the deal since ""day minus one"" as he put it on Wednesday, said clients had been exiting Publicis and Omnicom at the rate of ""four-to-one in our favor"". Speaking at the Cannes Lions industry gathering, Levy said the company had not lost clients beyond the usual cycle of losses and wins typical in the advertising business.""It is silly to have this kind of war,"" he said. ""I would prefer to see Martin using the British sense of humor, which is so witty and so interesting."" DIGITAL DEALS To win back investors, Levy said the group would look to bulk up in digital services and raise its dividend.""Next year our payout ratio will be 35 percent, and we plan to maybe increase it to 40 percent,"" he said. ""We are thinking about it."" Levy said marketing on digital devices such as tablets and smartphones and on platforms such as Facebook was growing fast, accounting for 40 percent of revenue this year and likely to be more than half by 2018.Some digital development will come from partnerships and some from acquisitions, he said. ""No one should dream about huge acquisitions. There will be some reasonable-sized ones,"" he said. ""They will be all in digital.""Levy said the Publicis board would start to tackle the question of who will succeed him at the end of the year. His tenure ends at the end of 2015, and he said he will not seek a new mandate. Board deliberations will probably continue in the first half of next year, he said.On current trading, Levy said he still expected growth in the second quarter to be lower than in the first and an acceleration to come in the third.""We don't expect any particular good news for the second quarter. We will be slightly positive, but very slightly, and we expect very good growth in the third quarter,"" he said.

Publicis is the world's third-largest advertising group after Britain's WPP Plc and its deal with No. 2 Omnicom was supposed to create the world's largest agency, best-equipped to compete in the Internet era. They called it off in early May after a battle for control and divergent corporate cultures.Omnicom said separately it remained on track to hit its full-year organic revenue growth target of between 4 and 4.5 percent, after posting higher-than-expected quarterly revenue and profit.Publicis Chief Executive Maurice Levy said the strong euro was also to blame for chipping away at Publicis's growth, currency effects having stripped 148 million euros out of revenue in the first half.Asked why Publicis was trailing rivals such as Interpublic , which posted organic sales growth of 4.7 percent in the second quarter, Levy said that trying to rescue the floundering Omnicom tie-up had taken up a lot of management time.""There was a negative effect, which we had somewhat underestimated, from our intense concentration on the merger,"" said Levy. ""But that's behind us now and we are focused on the future."" BUSINESS PLAN Forced to go it alone, Publicis said it was revising its business plan, unveiled last year, and would publish a new version by October.The group will also have to fight to keep key customers, notably electronics maker Samsung, whose multi-billion euro contract is under review and may be decided in September. Analysts began paring back their expectations for the year, with UBS and Exane BNP Paribas predicting organic growth of 3 percent and Jeffries saying it could be as low as 2 percent.Publicis' second-quarter sales fell to 1.76 billion euros ($2.5 billion) from 1.79 billion a year earlier, missing an average analysts' forecast of 1.88 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.First-half operating profit fell to 435 million euros from 460 million a year earlier and the company's operating margin slipped to 13 percent from 13.7 percent.First-half sales were nearly unchanged at 3.36 billion euros, while organic growth was 1.8 percent. Stripping out the effect of the strong euro, Publicis said organic growth would have been 5 percent.Speaking at a press briefing, Levy said there was little Publicis could do to blunt currency effects, since foreign exchange hedging tools were less effective in the global advertising business than in other industries and agencies could not raise prices and remain competitive.Asked whether Publicis would still be able to deliver its target of improving operating margins this year, Levy said the company planned to clamp down on costs so as to ""come in as close as we can to our goal"".The share price performance of leading ad agencies has varied widely this year. WPP shares are down about 11 percent, hurt by the pound's strength, while Omnicom and Havas  have fallen about 2 percent. Interpublic has risen 12 percent largely because some investors see it as a possible takeover target.The European media sector as a whole has fallen 3 percent in the same period.

66,"  PARIS Advertising group Publicis (PUBP.PA) shook up its management to prepare for life after its failed merger with U.S. based Omnicom, parting company with its Chief Operating Officer and teeing up for the eventual departure of chairman Maurice Levy.In a statement on Tuesday in which it also reaffirmed its 2018 targets, the company said COO Jean-Yves Naouri was leaving the board to be replaced by Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner, who joined the company in April 2012.Levy, aged 72, will stay on long enough to approve the company's financial statements for the 2016 fiscal year, the company said, stepping down at the spring 2017 shareholders meeting.Before the Omnicom deal, Naouri had been seen as a potential successor to Levy, but he had failed to secure a prominent role under the merger plan. The deal fell apart this year over leadership conflicts that deepened during delays to tax and antitrust approvals.Publicis also said it was hiring Axel Duroux ""to take over strategy, development, performance and optimization of the Groupe's presence in emerging and fast-growing markets"". This role had been filled by Naouri.

67,"  (Adds analyst quote, Omnicom deal, Criteo)PARIS, Sept 16 Advertising group Publicis  shook up its management to prepare for life after its failed merger with U.S. based Omnicom, parting company with its Chief Operating Officer and teeing up for the eventual departure of chairman Maurice Levy.In a statement on Tuesday in which it also reaffirmed its 2018 targets, the company said COO Jean-Yves Naouri was leaving the board to be replaced by Anne-Gabrielle Heilbronner, who joined the company in April 2012.Levy, aged 72, will stay on long enough to approve the company's financial statements for the 2016 fiscal year, the company said, stepping down at the spring 2017 shareholders meeting.Before the Omnicom deal, Naouri had been seen as a potential successor to Levy, but he had failed to secure a prominent role under the merger plan. The deal fell apart this year over leadership conflicts that deepened during delays to tax and antitrust approvals.

76,"  * Publicis aims to boost growth after failed Omnicom merger* CEO Maurice Levy bets on digital ads and marketing* Sapient options unusually active before announcement* Deal financed with existing cash and debt* Publicis shares fall as much as 5 pct   (Adds information about options moves before deal, additional quotes from Levy)By Leila AbboudPARIS, Nov 3 Publicis, the world's third-largest advertising agency, is to buy U.S.-based digital ad specialist Sapient for $3.7 billion in cash as it seeks to accelerate growth after a botched merger earlier this year.The French group is hoping rapid growth in both North American and Internet advertising, which are far outpacing European and traditional ad formats, will help it catch up with sales gains at rivals such as WPP and Interpublic .Chief Executive Maurice Levy has blamed Publicis' recent poor performance on a failed merger with world No.2 ad agency Omnicom, announced in August 2013 and abandoned in May over control and cultural clashes.But some analysts said Publicis' offer of $25 per share, a 44 percent premium to Sapient's closing price on Friday, was a hefty price for a company whose growth may have peaked.The transaction, which followed an unusual rally in Sapient shares and options last week, could also dash hopes among the French company's shareholders that cash might be distributed to them, analysts said.Publicis shares fell 2.3 percent, while Sapient was up 42 percent at $24.59 in early afternoon trading.""A good asset at a steep price,"" said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Charles Bedouelle of the deal, adding it would ""likely push back (Publicis') cash return story by two years.""UBS analyst Tamsin Garrity said Publicis had been under pressure from investors to return cash, and was expected to announced share buybacks at a strategy day on Friday. ""The acquisition of Sapient makes such returns unlikely,"" she added. Garrity has a neutral rating on Publicis shares.Levy defended the decision, saying the company would generate more value in the long term by buying Sapient rather than buying back its own shares. He pledged to update investors on his approach to dividends and buybacks sometime in November.""This operation is extremely important for securing the future of Publicis,"" Levy said. ""It is far better to invest and deliver a higher growth and higher profits ... which will lead to a re-rating, rather than simply buy back our own shares.""""The deal will create a foundation for accelerated growth"" by giving Publicis access to new markets and revenues, he added.Publicis said the deal would be financed through existing cash and new debt, and would not affect Publicis' credit rating. It did not say when it would add to group profits but forecast 50 million euros ($63 million) in annual cost savings.""A JILTED LOVER""?  Sapient's sales grew 14.1 percent to 1.1 billion euros last year, far outstripping Publicis' sales growth of 1.2 percent, though the French company had a higher operating profit margin. The U.S-based group earned 63 percent of its 2013 sales in North America and has 13,000 employees, 8,500 of which are in India.""The risk that growth slows at Sapient is one of the transaction's more important considerations,"" said Pivotal Research Group analyst Brian Wieser.He noted the deal gave Sapient an enterprise value (equity plus debt) of around 12 times its forecast earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) for 2015, far above Publicis' current multiple of about 8 times.Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of Publicis' rival WPP, was even harsher, telling financial blog Business Insider that Publicis had rushed into the Sapient deal to compensate for its botched marriage with Omnicom.""It looks like the behaviour of a jilted lover,"" said Sorrell, who often trades barbs with his cross-channel rival.Levy responded on a later conference call that he did not think Sorrell ""knew anything about love."" ""When it comes to love he should give that to the French,"" he said.Buying Sapient will speed Publicis' roughly seven year-old effort to earn more revenue from digital advertising, which includes everything from online marketing to brand building on social networks and automatic ad buying for major customers.Last year, 38.4 percent of Publicis' sales came from digital, and it had been aiming to reach 50 percent by 2018, something that the Sapient deal will make happen immediately.According to Zenith Optimedia, the digital ad market is expected to grow 17.1 percent this year, driving total ad market growth of 5.3 percent.Sapient's main SapientNitro unit is a digital agency on a par with Publicis' Razorfish and WPP's AKQA with customers including carmaker Fiat, retailer Marks & Spencer and consumer goods group Unilever.'SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY'? Sapient shares rose 20 percent last week ahead of the deal announcement, compared to a 3.3 percent rise in the Nasdaq, prompting some market observers to question whether information had leaked.  Trading in options in Sapient was also especially heavy.""It looks like that there was some suspicious activity in Sapient,"" said optionMonster.com lead analyst David Russell. ""Someone is definitely making a lot of money on this and they were buying the calls right before the merger was announced.""Sapient boss Alan Herrick will continue to run the company and join Publicis' management team, while Jerry Greenberg, the co-chairman of Sapient's board, will join Publicis' board.The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of next year.

78,"   By Alister, Doyle,, Environment and Correspondent | OSLO  OSLO A promise by Japan on Sunday to give up to $1.5 billion to a U.N. fund to help poor nations cope with global warming puts the fund within sight of a $10 billion goal and brightens prospects for a U.N. climate pact next year.Japan's pledge, at the G20 meeting of world leaders in Australia, raises the total promised to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) to $7.5 billion, including up to $3 billion by U.S. President Barack Obama on Saturday.The Seoul-based GCF Secretariat in a statement hailed the pledges as a turning point before a first donors' conference in Berlin on Thursday. The United Nations has set an informal target of raising $10 billion this year.The cash, to help emerging economies curb their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to changes such as heatwaves, mudslides and rising sea levels, is widely seen as vital to unlock a U.N. climate deal meant to be agreed in late 2015 in Paris. ""These pledges bring us a giant step closer reaching a global climate agreement in Paris,"" said Athena Ballesteros of the World Resources Institute think-tank. Hela Cheikhrouhou, executive director of the GCF, said she hoped the U.S. and Japanese pledges and an unexpected G20 focus on climate change would translate into further significant contributions by other countries.Nations including Britain, Italy, Canada and Australia have yet to announce pledges. Among other big donors, Germany and France have previously each promised about $1 billion for a first round of funds for the GCF, lasting four years.  The GCF is a major part of a plan agreed in 2009 to raise financial flows to help developing nations tackle climate change, from public and private sources, to $100 billion a year by 2020.G20 leaders put a spotlight on climate change despite efforts by host Australia to focus more narrowly on economic growth. [ID:nL3N0T44NX]  Christiania Figueres, head of the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat, welcomed the U.S. and Japanese pledges and other recent action on climate change, saying they had triggered a positive atmosphere for the Berlin meeting.Last week, the United States and China set goals for curbing climate change, brightening prospects for Paris even though their promises, including Beijing's plan for a undefined peak in greenhouse gas emissions by around 2030, were vague.

(bit.ly/1yeEhpJ)The $35 billion Omnicom-Publicis pairing would have overtaken WPP (WPP.L) as the world's biggest advertising company. It fell apart over leadership conflicts and delays to tax and antitrust approvals.Investors want to see the rebound Levy has promised.""The only credible response will be a return to organic growth in 2015. That will need to be visible in the figures. The most important thing is to stem client losses, at Razorfish in particular,"" said Conor O'Shea of analyst Kepler Cheuvreux.Razorfish is Publicis' digital advertising arm making ads targeted at the Internet, which is the industry's growth area.  But online giants like Google are moving to cut agencies out and capture ad spending directly, hitting players like Razorfish, which has lost business from clients including Motorola and Blackberry.Levy has blamed his company's problems in part on an over-enthusiastic focus on the merger, but Publicis' organic growth was just 1 percent in the third quarter of 2014, while ex-merger partner Omnicom managed 6.5 percent.At the investor day on Thursday, investors expect an update on profitability targets set out in September and also on the company's performance in emerging markets.

(bit.ly/1yeEhpJ) The $35 billion Omnicom-Publicis pairing would have overtaken WPP as the world's biggest advertising company. It fell apart over leadership conflicts and delays to tax and antitrust approvals.Investors want to see the rebound Levy has promised.""The only credible response will be a return to organic growth in 2015. That will need to be visible in the figures. The most important thing is to stem client losses, at Razorfish in particular,"" said Conor O'Shea of analyst Kepler Cheuvreux. Razorfish is Publicis' digital advertising arm making ads targeted at the Internet, which is the industry's growth area.But online giants like Google are moving to cut agencies out and capture ad spending directly, hitting players like Razorfish, which has lost business from clients including Motorola and Blackberry.Levy has blamed his company's problems in part on an over-enthusiastic focus on the merger, but Publicis' organic growth was just 1 percent in the third quarter of 2014, while ex-merger partner Omnicom managed 6.5 percent.At the investor day on Thursday, investors expect an update on profitability targets set out in September and also on the company's performance in emerging markets.

Shares of market leader WPP, which gets a third of its revenue from North America, have increased 16 percent.""Marketers are willing to spend and hire agencies, so overall it is going to be a solid year for advertising agencies in North America,"" Wedbush Securities analyst James Dix said.Publicis, whose sales rose 2.9 percent on an organic basis in the first quarter, has been lagging its bigger rivals as it recovers from the distractions of a failed deal to buy Omnicom in 2014.The French company got a boost this quarter from accounts won at the end of last year and growth in its digital business, Sapient, which it bought for $3.7 billion in February last year.Publicis, home to agencies such as Leo Burnett Worldwide and Saatchi & Saatchi, said organic revenue rose 3 percent in North America and 3.4 percent in Europe.

105,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss | LAS VEGAS  LAS VEGAS William Doyle, a key figure in Pershing Square Capital Management's controversial investment in battered drug company Valeant Pharmaceuticals, is leaving the hedge fund, its founder, William Ackman, told investors on Wednesday.    Doyle joined Pershing Square's investment team in October 2014, but had also been involved in other projects including advising cancer therapy company Novocure, which listed its stock last year.""The demands of overseeing Novocure and managing its relationship with shareholders and other stakeholders have made it infeasible for Bill to continue as a member of the investment team,"" Ackman wrote in a letter to investors that was seen by Reuters.Novocure said on Wednesday that Doyle will be the company's executive chairman after having already been a board member. Ackman said Doyle will also spend time at Table Management, an entity that oversees private investments for Ackman's family, Ackman wrote in his letter. Doyle introduced Michael Pearson, the former CEO of Valeant, and Ackman, the billionaire activist investor, in early 2014 and a year later Ackman's Pershing Square invested in the Canadian drugmaker.In 2015, Ackman called Valeant his best idea but it has become the firm's biggest ever loser. Valeant's stock has tumbled 85 percent amid scrutiny over its accounting and pricing practices, ultimately prompting Ackman to join Valeant's board and forcing Pearson to leave his position as CEO. Doyle was friends with Pearson from their days as consultants at McKinsey and Doyle knew Ackman through Harvard Business School. Doyle joined Pershing Square's investment team shortly after brokering the initial meeting and helped oversee science-oriented investments.Last month, Pershing Square said Doyle would not stand for reelection as a board member at animal health company Zoetis Inc. Earlier this week the fund sold a chunk of its investment in the company. Doyle's exit marks the second departure of a Pershing Square investment team member in five months. In January, Paul Hilal, who has been friends with Ackman since college, left the firm.

109,"  SAO PAULO A Brazilian court plans to hold a hearing on Thursday on the case of a former Telefonica Brasil SA senior executive who says the country's No. 1 wireless carrier planted news that she acted to permit excessive price differences in advertising contracts. The former executive, Cristina Duclos, and representatives from Telefónica Brasil are scheduled to meet at the 33rd Labor Court of São Paulo to discuss their case and seek an out-of-court settlement, according to a person familiar with the matter and information obtained from the court. Duclos - who led image and communications at the company's Vivo wireless unit until her departure in June - alleges that Telefónica Brasil spread news that she had breached internal guidelines for ad contacts. She wants Telefónica Brasil to reinstate her and give her a chance to prove her innocence. On July 25, Valor Econômico newspaper reported, without saying how it got the information, that Telefónica Brasil was investigating whether Duclos had colluded with ad agencies to overprice contracts. The incident led to a restructuring of the division and increased scrutiny of purchases, suppliers and contractors, according to the report. Duclos said in a statement to Reuters that her reinstatement ""will lead the company to explain whether such an investigation existed.""  If reinstated, Duclos said she would work to ""make ad contracts more transparent, for I am sure that ad agencies have nothing to hide."" Telefónica Brasil said in a statement to Reuters that ""it does not comment on ongoing legal cases.""  The company said in July 26 securities filing that contract reviews are normal, although it denied having put in place the procedures that the Valor report described. The situation underscores the extent to which reputational and compliance risks have grown for senior executives and listed Brazilian companies, after a series of scandals involving some of the country's main state-controlled and privately run firms.  Telefónica Brasil's Vivo wireless unit spends about 1 billion reais ($309 million) a year on marketing and advertising, and lists the country's largest ad agencies as contractors, including Omnicom Group Inc's Africa, DPZ&T and Young & Rubicam. If the sides fail to end their dispute during the hearing, the judge could open a formal enquiry into the matter, obliging Telefónica Brasil and Vivo to open their publicity contracts and be subject to court-mandated audit, the person and a lawyer specialized in labor disputes said.
