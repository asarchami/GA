0,"   By Sharon Begley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 6 A long-running and well-respected workplace wellness program at PepsiCo  that encourages employees to adopt healthier habits has not reduced healthcare costs, according to the most comprehensive evaluation of a such a program ever published.Released on Monday in the journal Health Affairs and based on data for thousands of PepsiCo employees over seven years, the findings ""cast doubt on the widely held belief"" that workplace wellness programs save employers significantly more than they cost, conclude Soeren Mattke of the RAND Corporation and his co-authors. ""Blanket claims of 'wellness saves money' are not warranted.""Workplace wellness programs, a $6 billion-a-year industry, are a favorite of the business community because they promise to improve productivity, cut absenteeism and reduce medical costs by averting expensive illnesses. They aim, for instance, to help employees quit smoking, maintain a healthy weight and have regular screenings for elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure, cancer and other conditions, all of which are supposed to reduce healthcare spending.Half of U.S. employers with at least 50 workers offered a wellness program in 2012, as did more than 90 percent of those with 50,000-plus workers, according to a 2013 RAND report. PepsiCo's was introduced in 2003.The programs are also a pillar of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law. The ACA allows employers to reward workers who participate in wellness programs, and penalize those who refuse, with discounts or increases of as much as 30 percent of their insurance costs. That can be thousands of dollars per year.Some workers have objected to the programs because of the penalties. Others say workplace wellness efforts invade their privacy and promote poor medicine.Last year, for instance, faculty members at Pennsylvania State University rebelled against a workplace wellness program whose ""health risk assessment"" asked, among other questions, whether male employees examined their testicles every month and whether women employees intended to become pregnant. They also protested its requirement that even healthy young adults receive frequent cholesterol and other screenings, which physicians recommend against, and the steep penalties for opting out: $1,200 a year.""You're making employees do something that invades their privacy and that goes against medical advice, and now we're seeing (in the PepsiCo study) that it doesn't even save the employer money,"" said Al Lewis, founder and president of the Disease Management Purchasing Consortium International, which helps self-insured employers and state programs reduce healthcare costs. PepsiCo did not respond to requests for comment on the study. Megan Broderick, senior manager of the company's health and wellfare benefits and a co-author of the Health Affairs paper, said she could not speak to a reporter without permission.The vendor that sold PepsiCo the program, the SHPS division of ADP, also declined to comment, citing ""client confidentiality,"" said ADP spokesman Dick Wolfe.Maria Ghazal, a vice president of the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives of large U.S. corporations, said its members are ""as enthusiastic as they have ever been about these (workplace wellness) programs,"" adopting them not only to control healthcare costs but also to boost employee morale and improve recruitment.""Wellness is an area where you can distinguish yourself,"" she said. ""Employers feel they help attract and retain"" valued workers. 'HEALTHY LIVING' For their study, RAND's Mattke and his colleagues - including two PepsiCo executives - examined PepsiCo's ""Healthy Living"" program, which has two components.One, called disease management, helps people with any of 10 chronic illnesses, among them asthma, diabetes and hypertension. They receive regular phone conversations with a nurse about managing the condition. Disease management produced healthcare savings of $136 per member per month, largely because of a 29 percent reduction in hospital admissions, the researchers found. When hypertension is well controlled, for instance, people are less likely to land in the hospital with a stroke. When asthmatics take their medication, they don't wind up in the ER unable to breathe.PepsiCo's disease management program ""provides a substantial return for the investment made,"" Mattke said.The ""lifestyle management component"" is what most people think of as a workplace wellness program. It includes a health risk assessment in which workers answer questions about such behavior as eating and exercise habits; smoking cessation programs; and educational materials and telephone sessions with a ""wellness coach"" to help them lose weight, eat healthy, get fit, manage stress or stop smoking.PepsiCo employees who participated in these lifestyle programs reported a small reduction in absenteeism, but there was no significant effect on healthcare costs. (The study uses costs as a proxy for health, assuming that if people get sick they seek care. But it did not explictly assess the programs' effect on participants' health.)""Participation in lifestyle management interventions,"" conclude the PepsiCo researchers, ""... has no statistically significant effect on healthcare costs,"" and employers considering adopting such a program ""should proceed with caution.""The PepsiCo study is not the first to find that workplace wellness programs fall short of their promise. Last year, Mattke was the lead author of a RAND report that found that healthcare costs of workers who participated in such a program averaged $2.38 less per month than non-participants in the first year of the program and $3.46 less in the fifth year. Neither difference was statistically significant.Researchers who are skeptical of wellness programs' benefits are concerned that the ACA - ""Obamacare"" - allows employers to offer substantial financial rewards and penalties tied to something ineffective.""The ACA took a bad idea, workplace wellness programs, and turbocharged it by allowing employers to penalize workers,"" said Lewis, co-author of a new e-book titled ""Surviving Workplace Wellness.""",2014-01-06,PEP,"Mon Jan 6, 2014 | 4:00pm EST",PepsiCo's workplace wellness program fails the bottom line -study,http://www.reuters.com//article/wellness-workplace-idUSL2N0KF0CN20140106?type=companyNews

5,"  By Martinne Geller and Dmitry ZhdannikovDAVOS, Switzerland Jan 24 Pepsico, Nestle and Cisco on Friday announced major investments that together totaled more than $7 billion in Mexico, where the government has pushed through a series of economic reforms that aim to boost foreign investment and growth.Mexico has embraced free trade policies in recent decades, and has drawn growing investment interest after President Enrique Pena Nieto made a landmark reform drive in his first year in office, pushing major telecommunications, energy, banking and tax legislation through a divided Congress.""It is very encouraging to see the enthusiasm that has been awoken by our country due to the structural changes that are happening,"" Pena Nieto said at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos.Pepsico said it would spend $5 billion in Mexico over five years to strengthen its food and beverage business, adding it planned to expand its production capacity by adding new manufacturing lines and expand delivery routes.The company said the investment was expected to create 4,000 new jobs.The Pepsico investment comes despite a new levy on soft drinks and junk foods included in Pena Nieto's tax overhaul.Nestle said it planned to invest $1 billion in Mexico over five years, building two new factories and expanding a third in its sixth-biggest market. The world's No. 1 food maker said it would build an infant nutrition factory in Jalisco and a pet-food factory in Guanajuato, as well as expanding an existing cereal factory.The investment would create 700 direct jobs, Nestle said.The Mexican factories will produce goods for the wider region. For example, about 40 percent of the output from the baby food factory will be exported to Latin America and the Caribbean.In the third major investment announcement at Davos, Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc said it would direct $1.35 billion into Mexican manufacturing operations and a support center this year. Pena Nieto has said that foreign direct investment (FDI) in Mexico totaled $28 billion during the first 9 months of 2013.FDI was boosted last year by the Belgian-based beer giant Anheuser-Busch InBev's acquisition of Grupo Modelo , which went through at the end of May and brought in about $13 billion.OIL PROSPECTS  Separately, Mexican state-run company Pemex will sign a cooperation memorandum with Russia's No.2 oil producer Lukoil  on Friday, Pemex chief executive Emilio Lozoya told Reuters, as the country is opening up its energy sector in a move to boost production.Lozoya said that Pemex and Lukoil would share information on the deep water and shale deposits that Mexico currently lacks the expertise to tap.The planned cooperation between Lukoil and Pemex comes after Pena Nieto last month signed a bill into law that ended the country's 75-year-old oil and gas monopoly.Under the legislation, which is still being mapped out, foreign companies will be able to enter the sector as Pemex is seeking to bring in expertise and boost efficiency.""There are dozens of new players who now come and look at the opportunities that are opening up in Mexico,"" Pemex CEO Lozoya said.Lozoya said he met with various companies in Davos that expressed interest in exploration and production projects in Mexico as well as refining, petrochemicals and transportation businesses that are now open to private investment.As a private company, Lukoil is struggling to get large new deposits in Russia, including offshore, and is actively pursuing a foreign expansion to maintain its production levels.",2014-01-24,PEP,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 1:27pm EST",UPDATE 1-Mexico draws over $7 bln in foreign investment at Davos,http://www.reuters.com//article/davos-mexico-idUSL2N0KY0YX20140124?type=companyNews

7,"  * SodaStream shares up on takeover speculation* Experts say Coke could take larger stake in Green Mountain* Make-at-home soda market still small* Green Mountain deal marks Coke's return to in-home soda making   (Adds comment by industry expert, comment by SodaStream, industry background, closing share prices)By Lisa BaertleinFeb 6 Coca-Cola Co's $1.3 billion investment in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc puts pressure on at-home soda leader SodaStream International Ltd  to bolster its position through a partnership or merger with the likes of a PepsiCo Inc or Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.Coke's move on Wednesday to buy 10 percent of the maker of the popular Keurig one-cup coffee brewer and exclusively sell Coke products on its upcoming cold drink machine  is fueling speculation that the world's largest soda company could eventually buy the rest of Green Mountain, which would spur other deals in the sector, analysts said.The Coke deal eliminates SodaStream's ""best potential partner and creates a new level of competition,"" Canaccord Genuity analyst Scott Van Winkle said in a note.Shares of SodaStream rose 7.2 percent to close at $38.35 on the Nasdaq on Thursday, buoyed by takeover speculation.Soft drink makers - who have seen U.S. soda sales decline since 2005 - are warily watching trends such as at-home soda making and so-called water enhancers, such as Kraft Foods Group's Mio brand. They are unlikely to let a rival  get too far out in front, analysts said.""It's tit-for-tat"" with Coke and Pepsi, said Bevmark Consulting Chief Executive Officer Tom Pirko. Pepsi last year shot down rumors that it had approached Israel-based SodaStream with a $2 billion buyout offer.Pepsi declined to comment for this story and Dr Pepper Snapple did not respond to requests for comment.SodaStream said in an email that it viewed the Coke-Green Mountain deal as ""further recognition that custom carbonation is the future of the ... at-home carbonated beverage industry.""While some industry experts hailed the Coke-Green Mountain deal as historic or groundbreaking, Pirko called it a tentative step for Coke, which in the late 1980s launched a home and office soda machine called BreakMate.BreakMate fizzled after the machines were plagued by problems and consumers realized it cost less to buy two-liter bottles of soda at the store.""People shouldn't misjudge this as a revolution in the soft drink business,"" Pirko said of the Coke-Green Mountain deal.     Coke is ""testing the temperature of the water to see if they want to dive in."" Coke has made a handful of bite-by-bite acquisitions - including Honest Tea - to expand the types of drinks it offers.ONE-WAY EXCLUSIVITY While companies such as Starbucks Corp and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc have deals to provide coffee pods for the Keurig coffee machine, Coke took the extra step of investing in Green Mountain as it prepares to launch its single-serving cold drink machine as soon as October. Coke drink pods will be exclusive on Green Mountain's new machine, but Green Mountain's machine will use products from other drink makers.The investment decision from Coke ""causes us to wonder if this could be the first step in ultimately acquiring a larger stake in (Green Mountain),"" Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a client note. Shares of Green Mountain closed 26.2 percent higher at $102.10 on Thursday. They jumped more than 50 percent in extended trade on Wednesday after the Coke deal was announced.The gains prompted some short sellers to make fresh bets that Green Mountain's stock price would drop. Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management, shorted Green Mountain at $128 a share on Wednesday evening.""It is uncertain that the home soda market is all that large and whether it is taking market share,"" said Kass.""The heaviest users of SodaStream use it for sparkling water, as the flavor market and usage has been slow to develop,"" Kass said in a note to clients.John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest, called the Coke-Green Mountain deal a win-win, saying it gives the soda company a new avenue for growth with new technology that is cutting-edge and cool.UNPROVEN MACHINE But skeptics point out that Green Mountain's cold drink machine is still unproven, that the price consumers will pay for pods has not been announced, and that Coke's main challenge is to tempt consumers with new, premium drinks.""In our opinion, one of Coke's problems ... is not routes-to-market but innovation in the bottle,"" Stifel analyst Mark Swartzberg said in a client note.Another Stifel analyst, Jim Duffy, estimated SodaStream's global retail sales at about $100 million annually. That suggests Coke's potential retail sales on Green Mountain's new cold beverage machine would make just a small contribution to its net revenue, which was $12 billion in the third quarter.

Peltz's investment firm, Trian Fund Management, owns about $1.2 billion of PepsiCo stock.The billionaire investor has influenced food industry deals such as the spin-off of Dr Pepper Snapple Group from Cadbury, Kraft's purchase of Cadbury and the subsequent breakup of Kraft into Mondelez International and Kraft Foods Group Inc.Peltz also owns stakes and serves on the boards of The Wendy's Co, asset manager Legg Mason Inc and diversified U.S. manufacturer Ingersoll-Rand PLC.The investor had previously pushed PepsiCo to create a snack food giant by acquiring Oreo cookie maker Mondelez but dropped the idea after winning a seat on the Mondelez board last month.Peltz said on Thursday PepsiCo continues to lose market share to Coca-Cola in the Americas where it has been consistently ""out-innovated"" and ""outmaneuvered,"" which is putting increasing and unnecessary pressure on the company's other divisions such as Frito-Lay.PepsiCo, like rival Coca-Cola Co, has been battling  declining soda sales in developed markets, especially the United States, as health-conscious consumers switch to non-carbonated beverages such as juices and health drinks.Peltz's letter to PepsiCo's board was first reported by the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday.Coca-Cola on Thursday announced that Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard would retire in May after serving the company for more than 20 years.Fayard will be replaced by Vice President and Controller Kathy Waller, who joined Coke in 1987 from Deloitte.PepsiCo shares were up 1.6 percent at $78.29 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",2014-02-20,PEP,"Thu Feb 20, 2014 | 4:07pm EST",UPDATE 3-Nelson Peltz revives campaign to split up PepsiCo,http://www.reuters.com//article/peltz-pepsico-idUSL3N0LP3CF20140220?type=companyNews

18,"  By Shankar RamakrishnanNEW YORK, Feb 25 (IFR) - PepsiCo Inc made a huge splash in the US high-grade market on Tuesday, offering USD2bn of three-year and 10-year bonds to an investor base keen on fresh corporate debt.The bonds, which will fund repayment of commercial paper as well as general corporate purposes, were announced with initial price thoughts that carried a few basis points in new issue concession to entice orders.That strategy worked, as the food and beverage giant amassed more than USD4bn in orders even before the bookrunners came up with price guidance.Rated A1/A-/A, the bonds were announced as a three-part trade that comprised issuance of three-year fixed and floating and 10-year fixed rate notes.The three-year fixed had initial price thoughts of Treasuries plus low 40bp, while the 10-year fixed rate notes were shown at plus 105bp area. Pepsico's outstanding 1.25% August 2017s are trading at a G-spread of 34bp while its 2.75% March 2023s are at G+94bp. Based on these levels, at IPT stage, the three-year bonds are probably carrying only a few basis points and the 10-year bonds had about 11bp in new issue concessions.""Based on the liquidity of the company's existing debt, Pepsi's brand recognition, and our AA- issuer credit rating, the large new issue concession is not warranted; we expect official price talk will be reduced to near where the existing bonds are trading,"" Morningstar said.As expected, the three-year bonds were shown with a price guidance of T+35bp area (+/- 5bp) and the 10-year at plus 95bp area (+/- 3bp), or roughly 5bp-10bp tighter than IPT levels. As orders started piling up, these levels were further tightened and the three-year floating rate note was dropped at the launch stage, when the spread on a USD750m three-year fixed was fixed at plus 30bp and USD1.25bn 10-year at plus 92bp.These levels were judged to carry negative new issue concessions compared with the outstandings. The three-year was being priced about 4bp inside the outstanding August 2017s while the 10-year was about 2bp inside the March 2023s.A Gimme Credit report noted that the carbonated soft drink category has been declining at a pace of approximately 3% per year. In the PepsiCo Americas beverage segment, organic revenue was flat as volume fell 2% in the fourth quarter. For the full year of 2013, revenue dropped 1% on a volume decrease of 3%. ""We expect a similar trend this year. Unfortunately, growth in emerging markets is slowing also,"" the report said.""We expect total company organic revenue to increase roughly 4% to 5% in 2014. However, the negative impact of foreign currency changes should slice reported revenue growth to roughly 1%.""Free cash flow totaled USD3.4bn in 2013, but it is expected to decline to about USD3bn this year because of a 15% bump in the dividend. PepsiCo also intends to repurchase USD5bn of stock this year.""It is hard to ignore the fact that PepsiCo has tremendous brand value, a diverse portfolio of products, and excellent cash generation,"" Gimme Credit said.""But given the challenges in the beverage segment, its aggressive financial policy, and the ongoing event risk, we do not see much opportunity for spread tightening.""",2014-02-25,PEP,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 2:34pm EST",UPDATE 1-PepsiCo launches USD2bn two-part bond,http://www.reuters.com//article/pepsi-bond-idUSL1N0LU1S120140225?type=companyNews

20,"  Feb 27 PepsiCo Inc said its board again rejected activist investor Nelson Peltz's renewed call to split the company's beverage business from its flourishing snacks division.Ian Cook, presiding director of the company's board, in a letter to Peltz on Thursday said the board and management were ""comfortable"" and in ""complete alignment"" in rejecting his proposal.Cook said PepsiCo had analyzed the company's current structure and its beverage business and concluded that it was better off as a combined food and beverage company.""In short, the board and management have concluded that the financial engineering you (Peltz) propose erodes value for shareholders rather than creates value,"" Cook wrote in the letter sent to Trian Fund Management, Peltz's investment fund. PepsiCo's response comes a week after Peltz sent a 37-page letter to its board urging them to create ""two leaner and more entrepreneurial companies"" by spinning off the floundering beverage business and focusing on its fast-growing billion-dollar snack business, which owns brands such as Doritos, Cheetos and Lays. Peltz had said a spin-off would boost sales and margins in the snacks business, while the drinks business would generate stable flow of cash that could be returned to shareholders.Trian owned about $1.2 billion of Pepsico stock, as of last week. Peltz, in an interview with CNBC earlier in the day, said he would take the issue to every major Pepsi shareholder in the coming weeks to garner support.PepsiCo shares were up slightly in post-market trading after closing at $79.07 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.",2014-02-27,PEP,"Thu Feb 27, 2014 | 6:00pm EST",PepsiCo again rejects Peltz's proposal to split up company,http://www.reuters.com//article/peltz-pepsico-idUSL3N0LW5VE20140227?type=companyNews
21,"   By Adam Jourdan | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) has signed a deal to supply beverages to Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) first China resort, breaking The Coca-Cola Co's (KO.N) quarter century monopoly over beverage supply to the U.S. theme park operator.PepsiCo and its partner in China, Tingyi Cayman Islands Holding Corp (0322.HK), will exclusively provide beverages to the Shanghai Disney Resort, its first on mainland China which is set to open at the end of 2015, PepsiCo, Disney and Tingyi said in a joint statement on Thursday.Coca-Cola has had a long-standing tie-up with Disney, while it has been at least 25 years since PepsiCo last sold its beverages through the theme park chain, a Dubai-based PepsiCo spokesman said.The deal is only a tiny segment of China's 421 billion yuan ($68.74 billion) soft drink sector, but marks a blow for PepsiCo against Coke in the highly competitive market, where both brands are coming under increasing pressure from Chinese rivals and changing consumer tastes for local flavors.""I wonder what kind of message it sends to Coke globally. Even though the Disney park is only one small thing, China has massive room to grow for the Disney brand. Tying up this deal could mean good things going forward,"" said Ben Cavender, Shanghai-based principal at China Market Research Group.Disney said it currently has no plans to ink similar deals with PepsiCo to supply its other resorts, although it is ""actively pursuing opportunities in a variety of different sectors,"" Murray King, vice president of public affairs for the Shanghai Disney Resort, said. The PepsiCo spokesman said he could not comment on whether PepsiCo and Disney planned other tie-ups. Disney has a further 11 theme parks and 44 resorts around the world, according to its official website.PEPSI VS COKE Coca-Cola edges the China market with a 15.7 percent share of China's soft drinks market in 2012, ahead of PepsiCo's 4.5 percent share by off-trade volume, according to data from Euromonitor. China's soft drinks sector is worth around 421 billion yuan ($69.12 billion). Chinese consumers are increasingly opting for healthier alternatives in food and drink, which has also hit growth for fast food chains such as McDonald's Corp (MCD.N) and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc (YUM.N).Coca-Cola remains the soft drinks supplier for Disney resorts outside mainland China. It is the beverage provider for Disney's 11 parks in the United States, Hong Kong, France and Japan, a Singapore-based spokeswoman for Coca-Cola said.""The Coca-Cola Company and The Walt Disney Company share a long-standing partnership that dates to the first Disney television show in 1950 and the first Disneyland theme park in 1955. Today, our global partnership with Disney is as strong as ever,"" she added in emailed comments to Reuters. Though it retains the biggest market share in China, but local rivals are catching up. Pepsi's partner in the market, Taiwanese Tingyi, raised its market share from 9.9 percent in 2007 to 12.8 percent in 2012, according to Euromonitor.Tingyi and PepsiCo beverages will be the sole range of drinks sold at the Shanghai park, a Tingyi spokesman said. All three companies declined to put a value on the deal.The key question for Pepsi is if it can leverage its tie-up with Disney outside the limits of the resort, said Cavender.""If they can do more Disney-themed adverts elsewhere I can see this benefiting them a lot, and the fact Disney switched from Coke to Pepsi here could mean big things for the years ahead in other markets too,"" he said.

27,"   By Siddharth Cavale | March 13  March 13 Activist investor Nelson Peltz, who has been pushing PepsiCo Inc to separate its beverage and snacks businesses, blasted the company yet again on Thursday and demanded answers on operational issues and its corporate strategy.Peltz's Trian Fund Management, which owns nearly 1 percent of PepsiCo's stock, has been urging the company to split its flourishing snacks division from its sluggish beverage business to create ""two leaner and more entrepreneurial companies.""Peltz, in a letter to PepsiCo's board on Thursday, demanded the company give details about its expenses and provide volume growth and market share data for all its beverage categories in North America.He also called for a meeting of shareholders and board members without the presence of PepsiCo's management.In an email response to Peltz's latest letter, PepsiCo said two of its board members had already met with Trian without management present. ""The board has thoroughly reviewed Trian's proposals and has concluded that they would not maximize shareholder value,"" PepsiCo said.The company, known for beverages like Pepsi, Tropicana and Gatorade, also sells snacks such as Lays, Cheetos and Doritos chips, among others. PepsiCo, like rival Coca-Cola Co, has been battling declining soda sales in developed markets, especially the United States, as health-conscious consumers switch to non-carbonated beverages such as juices and health drinks.Peltz, in his latest letter, also asked PepsiCo to outline plans for its bottling operations, which have been a drag on the company's performance.""Last fall, management told us that the acquisitions were 'a mistake' and the bottling system was 'in disarray' when the bottlers were acquired, yet we believe the system is operating far less efficiently today,"" Peltz wrote. He asked PepsiCo to explain why it believed spending $240 million on renovating its headquarters was better than investing in raising its bottling capacity and launching more package sizes to compete better with Coca-Cola."" ... In a recent phone conversation, CEO Indra Nooyi acknowledged that PepsiCo is indeed behind Coke in alternative package sizes but argued that catching up would require significant capital investment,"" Peltz wrote.He urged the company to cut costs by reducing the number of its headquarters to two from four and invest the savings in price, marketing, innovation and packaging. Peltz criticized PepsiCo Presiding Director Ian Cook's response to his earlier letter sent in February.""The dismissive tone of his letter suggests that you do not appreciate the degree to which PepsiCo's shareholders are frustrated,"" Peltz wrote on Thursday.Cook, in his response late in February, reiterated PepsiCo's stance that its board and management were ""comfortable"" and in ""complete alignment"" on rejecting Peltz's demands.The company has rejected Peltz's proposals several times, calling them ""costly distractions that will harm shareholder interests.""A Wall Street survey conducted by Bernstein Research and released earlier this month showed that a majority of institutional investors, including PepsiCo's shareholders, support a split.PepsiCo's shares closed little changed at $81.80 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.",2014-03-13,PEP,"Thu Mar 13, 2014 | 7:35pm EDT","Peltz blasts PepsiCo again, seeks details on operations, strategy",http://www.reuters.com//article/peltz-pepsico-idUSL3N0MA5S020140313?type=companyNews

37,"  NEW YORK The Coca-Cola Company said on Monday it will remove a controversial flavoring stabilizer from some of its drinks, following rival PepsiCo Inc's announcement earlier this year that it would drop the same ingredient from its drinks.The ingredient, brominated vegetable oil (BVO), is a chemical containing bromine, which is found in fire retardants. Small quantities of BVO are used legally in some citrus-flavored drinks in the United States to keep the flavor evenly distributed.Coca-Cola said the ingredient was dropped from two flavors of its Powerade drink - fruit punch and strawberry lemonade - earlier this year. The company expects to remove it from its Fanta and Fresca sods, and as well as citrus-flavored fountain drinks, by year's end for U.S. consumers.The company said it will also remove the ingredient in its products sold globally but did not provide a timeline. Coke, which has said its use of BVO was safe for consumers, will use as a replacement sucrose acetate isobutyrate, which it has used for over a decade in some drinks, or glycerol ester of rosin, a ingredient commonly found in chewing gums and drinks, the company said.The use of the chemical in sports drinks has drawn concern from consumers as well as from a Mississippi teenager, Sarah Kavanagh, who circulated two online petitions to put pressure on Coca-Cola and PepsiCo to remove the ingredient from their drinks.

The company will close the two plants run by its Nidan unit on June 1 and transfer some of their capacity to the other juice unit, Multon, before the year-end, spokesman Vladimir Kravtsov said on Thursday.The plants being closed are located in Novosibirsk in Siberia and in the Moscow region. Some of the unit's 1,000 staff will be offered jobs at Multon, Kravtsov added.""The juice market fell by 5 percent last year and the performance of Nidan was worse than the market,"" said Kravtsov, adding the company had been considering the move for some time and made the closure decision at the end of last year. Coca-Cola bought Nidan, then the fourth-biggest juice maker in Russia, in 2010. Multon, which it acquired in 2005, has two plants with a combined production capacity of more than 790 million litres a year.The Russian juice market fell by 6 percent year-on-year in volume terms in January-September 2013, according to market researchers Nielsen. In addition to falling market volumes, Coca-Cola and its rival PepsiCo are faced with increased competition from local Russian brands. The decision also coincides with an economic slowdown in Russia. Having started to shrink in the first quarter this year, the economy is on the brink of recession, in large part because of capital outflows and declining investments resulting from Moscow's involvement in the Ukraine crisis.Based on Euromonitor data, Coca-Cola had a 23.5 percent share of the Russian juice market, worth an estimated $4.6 billion in 2013, while PepsiCo had 35.5 percent.That was down from 24.4 percent and 37.2 percent respectively in 2012, while local producers Sady Pridonya, Sunfruit-Trade as well as France's Lactalis all increased their market shares last year.Kravtsov said Nidan accounted for around one third of Coca-Cola's juice production in Russia.($1 = 34.9030 Russian Roubles)   (Reporting by Olga Sichkar and Maria Kiselyova; Editing by David Holmes)",2014-05-08,PEP,"Thu May 8, 2014 | 10:18am EDT",UPDATE 1-Coca-Cola to close two Russian juice plants as market shrinks,http://www.reuters.com//article/coca-cola-russia-idUSL6N0NU30F20140508?type=companyNews
40,"  (Adds details, CEO comments, possibility of more investment)CAIRO/DUBAI, June 22 Saudi Arabia's Almarai , the Gulf's biggest dairy company, and U.S. soft drinks giant PepsiCo will invest at least $345 million in Egypt over the next five years, the Saudi firm said on Sunday.The announcement was a fresh sign that after three years of stagnation because of political and economic turmoil following Egypt's 2011 revolution, foreign investment in the country may revive as a measure of stability returns.The Almarai investment would be conducted through Egyptian dairy and juice products firm International Company for Agro-Industrial Projects (Beyti), a subsidiary of International Dairy & Juice Ltd, which is owned 52 percent by Almarai and the remainder by Pepsico.Most of the money would come from equity injections by the joint venture partners in line with their ownership ratios, while Beyti would take on some debt. Almarai will finance its investment through its own cash flow, with the financial impact gradually reflected on its group balance sheet between the third quarter of this year and 2019, the company said.BIGGEST DAIRY FARM  The $345 million investment plan, approved by Almarai's board, includes setting up a new juice factory, expanding existing facilities, increasing Beyti's fleet of vehicles and sales netork, and creating a new dairy farm for 5,000 cows, Beyti's chief executive Mohamed Badran told Reuters.Almarai's CEO Abdulrahman Al Fadley, speaking at a joint news conference with Egyptian Trade and Industry Minister Mounir Fakhry Abdel Nour in Cairo, said he hoped to raise the investment amount to about $560 million over five years. The additional money would be spent on another dairy farm, which Badran said would be the biggest in Egypt, accommodating 20,000 cows. He added that this would depend on obtaining government approval for the purchase of land.Egypt's newly appointed investment minister Ashraf Salman said on Saturday that he was aiming for $10 billion of foreign direct investment for the coming fiscal year that starts in July, and $14 billion in three years. FDI for the first nine months of the current fiscal year was $4.4 billion.As part of a $500 million investment plan announced for Egypt in March, Coca-Cola will build a new juice plant near Cairo in a joint $100 million project with Saudi Arabia's Aujan Coca-Cola Beverages Co.In addition to Egypt's young and growing population, foreign companies see the country as a potential export base for markets in Africa and elsewhere. This year's election of former army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as president has raised hopes for greater political stability and better economic management.

42,"  LONDON, June 24 British sweeteners maker Tate & Lyle on Tuesday said its chief financial officer (CFO), Tim Lodge, would be replaced in August by PepsiCo  executive Nick Hampton.Tate & Lyle's shares are down nearly 16 percent this year after warning that cheap competition from China was denting its sucralose pricing, while a long and harsh U.S. winter hurt demand for soft drinks. Lodge, who has been CFO since 2008, will serve in his current role until Aug. 31 and will then leave after a short transition period. Hampton, who has been at PepsiCo for more than 20 years, was most recently the soda and snack company's president of West Europe. That experience was seen as highly relevant, since PepsiCo is a major Tate & Lyle customer. ""We would expect Hampton to bring best-in-class commercial and financial perspectives, honed in a major multinational, plus some highly relevant customer insight,"" said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo in a research note, who said the transition seemed natural, given that Lodge had been in the role six years and had spent his whole career at Tate & Lyle.

Coke, like rival PepsiCo Inc, has been struggling with declining soda sales in developed markets such as the United States as consumers become more health conscious.Still, sparkling beverages volume, which includes carbonated energy drinks and waters, was flat in the quarter in North America, with brand Coca-Cola volumes up 1 percent.Overall, global unit case volumes grew 3 percent, primarily driven by higher sales in Asia Pacific and Eurasia & Africa. The company's net income attributable to shareholders fell to $2.60 billion, or 58 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $2.68 billion, or 59 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, Coke earned 64 cents per share.Revenue fell 1 percent to $12.57 billion.Analysts on average had expected earnings of 63 cents per share, on revenue of $12.83 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Coke also said its adjusted earnings would be hurt by 2 cents in the second half of the year due to the restructuring of its juice operations in Russia and the separation of its Brazilian bottling operations last year.

52,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK About a year ago, Texas rancher George Krueger worried about his weight, and decided it was time to downsize - his Coke cans, that is.Like increasing numbers of U.S. consumers, Krueger bet that by switching from regular-sized soda cans to 7.5 ounce ""mini""-sized ones, he could make a dent in his daily calorie intake.“It’s kind of a happy medium,” said the 62-year-old, who generally drinks a can a day, but sometimes goes for an extra one for more caffeine. “I can have my sweet fix but not feel guilty for having so much.”U.S. soft drink companies are betting that soda drinkers like Krueger and their willingness to buy smaller cans, even for a higher unit price, will be a potential antidote to weak sales as consumers shift away from sugary soft drinks.The mini-can is the latest move by food and beverage companies to boost their product offerings of smaller portion sizes that supposedly help consumers limit their caloric intake - even if there are signs that some end up reaching for another package or can.Mini can sales grew 3 percent in 2013 while the rest of the carbonated soft drink category dropped, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. Coca-Cola (KO.N) and Pepsi (PEP.N) said the cans were one of the few bright spots in U.S. soda sales in their second quarter earnings calls last month.“Consumers are paying more and more attention to calories now,” said Simon Lowden, chief marketing officer at Pepsi Beverages North America, in a phone interview last week. While such concerns might have once helped diet drinks, growing health worries about artificial sweeteners have hurt that category, experts say.     Coke, the world’s largest soda maker, said there was double-digit growth in mini cans even while sales volumes of sparkling beverages in North America were flat. Smaller sizes, which include mini cans, accounted for more than 60 percent of the volume growth in traditional Coke. Pepsi’s mini can business in the United States has grown 24 percent year-to-date in 2014 and was up 34 percent last year. The company said that this year, it has also seen a significant increase in the number of in-store displays of mini cans.There's still a lot of room for growth. In 2013, mini cans comprised just 3 percent of carbonated beverage cans sold in the U.S., according to Euromonitor International.Earlier this year, the mini can was featured for the first time in a television ad starring actor Cuba Gooding Jr. which ran during the Oscars, the second most visible time frame behind the Super Bowl, Lowden said.Even beer companies are experimenting in the U.S. with smaller packaging. MillerCoors, a U.S. joint venture between SABMiller Plc SAB.L and Molson Coors Co, (TAP.N) offers 7-ounce bottles of Miller High Life as well as 10-ounce cans of Redd’s Wicked Apple and Coors Light Summer Brew. Heineken has rolled out a new 8.5-ounce “slim” can, citing “explosive growth” in smaller sized cans in the international market. PACKAGING COUNTS The shift toward smaller cans “is almost the industry admitting that volume is not going to be growing very much,” said Ali Dibadj, a beverage analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. It is one way that companies can drive higher prices and larger margins: Consumers may feel as though they’re buying a cheaper, smaller soda, but they are often paying more per fluid ounce, analysts said. Indeed, there is a price difference between mini cans and regular cans at retail. At a Fairway grocery store in Manhattan last week, 7.5-ounce cans of regular Coke and Pepsi were $4.49 for an eight-pack. Twelve-ounce cans, on the other hand were $4.89 for a 12-pack. That works out to roughly 7 cents per ounce versus 3 cents an ounce.Teresa Votaw, 47, of Sugar Land, Texas, doesn't mind the higher prices. ""I shop a lot at Whole Foods and am very particular about my children's diet,"" said Votaw. ""I don't want my kids drinking sugary drinks, but I don't want them to be completely deprived.""Jennifer Harris, director of marketing initiatives at the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University, said that smaller package sizes can help reduce soda consumption. “Studies show that people drink whatever package it comes in,” she said. That’s not necessarily the case with all food products, such as 100-calorie snack packs. A 2008 study by Arizona State University researchers found that dieters actually consumed more of the food in smaller packages than they would if it was regular sized.Krueger, the Texas rancher, hasn’t lost weight as a result of the mini cans but said they are likely keeping him from gaining more bulge.“If I was really sensible, I wouldn’t drink them at all, but I just love the taste,"" he said.

54,"  * Multinational firms have local production, suppliers* Targeted nations export 10 pct of banned goods-analyst* German meat exports seen hardest hitBy Maria Kiselyova and Martinne GellerMOSCOW/LONDON, Aug 7 Western multinationals like Nestle, Unilever and McDonalds will feel only a limited effect from Russia's ban on certain food imports from Europe and the United States, since they largely produce domestically.In retaliation for sanctions related to the crisis in Ukraine, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday Russia would ban fruit, vegetable, meat, fish, milk and dairy imports from the United States, the European Union, Australia, Canada and Norway for one year starting immediately.While the impact on international food producers may be muted, Russian shoppers are expected to see the effect of the measures in higher prices.Makers of packaged goods said they were still assessing the potential damage, but many companies including PepsiCo  and Danone have invested heavily in Russia, building local plants, and already source most products locally.Nestle, for example, has invested $1.6 billion in Russia since 1996 and has 11 plants in the country producing a wide range of products from ice cream to pet food.""More than 90 percent of the company's products sold on the Russian market are produced locally, but there are specific raw materials that we import,"" a Nestle spokeswoman said, adding that it would take some time to estimate the potential impact if the ban forced changes in suppliers. ""The most unpleasant thing is the need to change suppliers on the go, off cycle, which would entail additional costs,"" said a spokeswoman for Anglo-Dutch group Unilever, a major ice cream and ketchup producer in Russia.A market source said companies would likely pay fines for early termination of contracts with suppliers of banned foodstuffs.Danone said Russian and Belarussian milk meets 100 percent of its needs for the Russian markets but declined to comment on possible implications of the milk and dairy import ban on the broader market and prices.Meanwhile Finnish dairy cooperative Valio Ltd has halted production of goods it exports from Finland to Russia, according to Finnish media. Nobody at the company was immediately available to comment. HIT TO GERMAN MEAT, BOOST FOR LOCAL SUPPLIERS According to research firm Euromonitor International, the country most affected by the ban would be Germany, followed by the United States, Ukraine and Canada. The amount of German meat and meat products exported to Russia in 2012 were worth about $900 million at wholesale, Euromonitor said.Of the categories banned - fruit, vegetables, meat, fish and dairy - Russian imports from the targeted countries account for less than 10 percent of production, as measured by wholesale prices, said Euromonitor food analyst Lianne van den Bos.""The restrictions were imposed on products that Russia can produce itself or is less dependent on banned countries,"" van den Bos said, adding that in these categories, Russia imports a lot from Latin America and Asia.""Having said that, these sanctions put pressure on local producers as well as other trade partners as Russia has to look elsewhere for substitution, which in turn is likely to push up prices for Russian consumers if government does not step in,"" she added. Russia's domestic food industry has grown significantly in recent years, boosted by earlier bans on U.S. meat imports over safety concerns and investment by foreign companies.""We're committed to developing local suppliers,"" said a spokesman for Mondelez International. ""In fact, over the last five years, we've doubled the share of procurement from local suppliers."" The maker of Cadbury chocolate and Oreo cookies generated $1.2 billion in revenue from Russia last year.At present McDonald's, the world's largest hamburger chain, sources 85 percent of its ingredients from more than 160 domestic suppliers.""We are continually looking at ways to extend cooperation with the Russian manufacturers,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We are monitoring the situation and will adjust our plans accordingly.""Pepsico, which is Russia's biggest buyer of potatoes and became the biggest food and beverage producer in the country when it bought juice and dairy maker Wimm-Bill-Dann in 2011, said that almost all of the products sold in Russia are made in Russia.""We are reviewing the new policy,"" a spokeswoman said.Even for meat companies like Tyson Foods and Hormel Foods, Russia has declined in importance, due to the earlier bans and efforts to boost its domestic food industry.""We're disappointed about the loss of the Russian market, but don't expect the impact to be significant since the volume we ship there can be absorbed by other global markets,"" said a Tyson spokesman.""If the ban came 10 years ago it would have been a big deal but at this point Russia is less important overall,"" said Liang Feng, a Chicago-based analyst for research firm Morningstar.

57,"   By Anjali Athavaley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The largest U.S. soda makers pledged on Tuesday to cut sugary drink calories by 20 percent in 10 years through education, marketing and packaging.The American Beverage Association, whose members include Coca-Cola Co, PepsiCo Inc, and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc, and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, announced the plan at the Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York. The alliance was founded by the American Heart Association and the Clinton Foundation.Soda makers plan to reach their goal by 2025 by educating communities to reduce the calories they are drinking, and offering more zero or low calorie drinks including bottled water.The American Beverage Association will select an independent evaluator to monitor progress, but it is unclear how many calories a 20 percent reduction would entail. The measure will likely be based on sales volume, calories per serving and the U.S. census population, said Susan K. Neely, president and chief executive of the American Beverage Association.""It'd be hard to sustain the progress that has been made so far without this commitment,"" Neely said in an interview. Such calorie-cutting initiatives are not new. In 2006 the American Beverage Association and the Alliance for a Healthier Generation partnered to reduce beverage calories in schools.In 2010, 16 of the biggest U.S. food and beverage companies, including Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, pledged to remove 1 trillion calories from the U.S. marketplace by 2012 and 1.5 trillion by 2015. The companies are part of the CEO-led Healthy Weight Commitment Foundation formed in 2009 to reduce obesity.  In January, companies in the foundation said they had collectively sold 6.4 trillion fewer calories in the United States in 2012 than in 2007. But an analysis by University of North Carolina researchers, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine last week, showed that total calories from packaged goods sold to households with children by those companies did not change from 2011 to 2012.Government data show that 34 percent of adults were obese in 2007-2008.

Our farmers will not have to throw their fruit away,"" he said after inaugurating a food park with a storage capacity of more than 20,000 tonnes for two dozen food processing companies.Modi's food processing minister said last month that PepsiCo should reduce the sugar content of its beverages, and asked the company to partner with the government to develop nutritious processed food for school students.The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

60,"  (Corrects day of U.N. speech to Saturday from Friday)By James B. KelleherSept 29 Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told nearly a dozen U.S. company chiefs on Monday that he is committed to liberalizing his country's economy, which has underperformed other emerging markets recently after years of breakneck growth.Modi spoke at a breakfast with 11 chief executive officers during his first U.S. visit since coming came to power in May, vowing to get India's economy back on track.The prime minister was headed to Washington for a private working dinner with President Barack Obama on the fourth day of the visit. Modi, however, is fasting.Among those attending the breakfast at the New York Palace Hotel were the CEOs of Caterpillar Inc and Boeing Co .""He wasn't at all like the politicians we're used to here,"" said Caterpillar Chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman, who shared his impressions of the breakfast meeting with Reuters.""He acknowledged that the last five years have been very difficult for the Indian population, the Indian economy and the world in general, and he vowed and promised to change that. I believed him. He was very serious. ... I was genuinely quite impressed.""However, some U.S. business groups have questioned Modi's reformist credentials.Last week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 15 other business associations representing various sectors gave a more cautious assessment of the prime minister's record so far. Modi also alarmed some foes of government tinkering with business last week when he said in India that multinational soft-drink giants PepsiCo Inc and Coca-Cola Co  should help increase sales by Indian farmers by adding fresh fruit juices to their fizzy drinks.In a letter to Obama, the U.S. business groups urged the president to press Modi to remove barriers to trade when the two leaders meet on Monday and TuesdayThe letter highlighted India's blockage of a key World Trade Organization agreement reached last year, which overshadowed a July 30-Aug. 1 visit to India by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry. The business alliance also complained about India's raised tariffs and ""burdensome"" new testing requirements on imported information and communication technology products.Last week, U.S. congressional leaders on trade and finance wrote to the U.S. International Trade Commission calling for a second investigation into India's ""unfair"" trade practices, detailing any changes under Modi.In a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank on Monday before heading to Washington, Modi reiterated India's WTO stance, saying that while India supported the trade pact, its demands for food stockpiles were not incompatible with it. He stressed his campaign to encourage manufacturing in India and the country's desire for U.S. research and technology, something U.S. firms have been reluctant to share without stronger Indian intellectual property protectionsIndia, which once seemed to vie with China for the title of fastest-growing developing economy, has stumbled in recent years as a spate of scandals undermined business confidence in the government's commitment to economic reform.Still, Modi had won the confidence of at least one other high-profile U.S. CEO even before the U.S. visit.Cisco Systems Inc Chief Executive John Chambers last week praised him as a leader who had ""captured the imagination"" of Indian business, adding that he would make the needed ""tough decisions"" to revive the company's economy. One of Modi's priorities on this trip is to gather more such endorsements and - judging from Oberhelman's reaction - he won some more converts at Monday's CEO breakfast.""I deeply believe that he's committed to changing India,"" Oberhelman said.""There's no question that part of his mission is to enhance and increase the investment climate in India, both for domestic companies and for direct investment.""Caterpillar is the world's largest maker of earthmoving construction and mining equipment. The Peoria, Illinois-based company operates several plants and research and development centers in India and - together with its two independent dealers - employs more than 10,000 people there.Monday's events follow three momentous days for India's new leader.On Saturday, Modi addressed the United Nations General Assembly, taking a jab at Pakistan over the disputed region of Kashmir. That evening, he appeared before some 60,000 people at a musical event in New York's Central Park aimed at ending global poverty and bringing essentials such as sanitation to all.And on Sunday, the prime minister received a rapturous welcome from Indian-Americans in an appearance in New York's Madison Square Garden arena.It was all a far cry from 2005, when the former chief minister of Gujarat was denied a U.S. visa over rioting in his home state that killed more than 1,000 people, mainly Muslims, three years before. Modi, who denies wrongdoing, has been exonerated by an Indian Supreme Court probe.However, the issue has not been forgotten and Modi's U.S. trip had an awkward start on Friday after a little-known human rights group sued him in New York, alleging he failed to stop the riots.

Still, challenges remained and in developed markets, consumer demand ""continues to be sluggish and in developing and emerging markets, there is continued macro and political volatility, most notably in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and a number of markets in Latin America,"" Chairman and Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said on a conference call with analysts. The activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management had recently urged the company to split its more successful snack division from its sluggish beverage business, to reduce costs and unlock value for shareholders. PepsiCo contended its current strategy was working and that it has exceeded analysts' estimates for earnings per share for 11 quarters in a row. Nooyi said Mountain Dew and Doritos chips were products that tended to be bought together in the United States. Internationally, PepsiCo was promoting its Lays and Pepsi brands jointly through ads and discounts, she said.  ""We are pleased with our results for the quarter and year to date particularly given the continued macro challenges we see across the globe,"" Nooyi said on the call. Shares were up 1.3 percent at $95.24 in late morning trading, beating its 2014 record of $94.21, after earlier rising as much as $96.21.  The company raised its full-year growth forecast for earnings per share to 9 percent from 8 percent before taking into account a foreign exchange impact of 4 percentage points due to a robust U.S. dollar.  Indeed, other companies, too, are likely to report the effects of a strong U.S. dollar on their overseas earnings, said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones. ""The dollar has been making some new highs,"" Russo said. ""You're going to see that as a pretty common theme as third quarter earnings start rolling out for any company that's multinationally based."" PepsiCo said it earned a net income of $2 billion, or $1.32 a share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 6, up from $1.9 billion, or $1.23 a share, a year earlier.  Earnings per share, excluding charges related to acquisitions and other items, was $1.36. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters were expecting $1.29 a share. Revenue, excluding the impact of currency translation and changes to PepsiCo's business, grew 3.1 percent. Overall revenue, which includes currency impacts, was $17.2 billion, up 2 percent from a year earlier.Sales in PepsiCo's Frito-Lay segment grew 3 percent while they were flat in the company's beverages segment.

Beverage giant PepsiCo rose 1.7 percent to $95.52 in premarket after raising its full-year profit forecast. However, in a factor that will be closely watched by investors throughout the season, revenue was slightly hurt by the impact of currency translations.Also in company news, Endo International Plc said it would buy Auxilium Pharmaceuticals Inc in a deal valued at $2.6 billion, including the repayment and assumption of debt. Shares of Endo dipped 0.3 percent to $70.80 in light premarket volume while Auxilium jumped 10.6 percent to $32.90.

69,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to PepsiCo,  Inc.'s (PepsiCo) newly issued $500 million 30-year senior note offering. Fitch  also assigns an 'A' rating to PepsiCo's $3.7725 billion five-year credit  agreement maturing in June 2019 and an 'A' rating to PepsiCo's $3.7725 billion  364-day revolving credit agreement. PepsiCo will use the net proceeds for  general corporate purposes. The Rating Outlook is Stable. PepsiCo had  approximately $32.7 billion of debt at the end of the third quarter 2014  (3Q'14).  The notes will be issued by PepsiCo, Inc. and will rank equally with PepsiCo's  senior unsecured obligations. Significant covenants include limitations on  secured debt and conditions related to consolidation, mergers or the sale of  assets. PepsiCo is not bound by any financial covenants. The notes are callable  by PepsiCo subject to a make-whole provision.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  PepsiCo's ratings reflect its considerable financial flexibility, substantial  cash flow, significant scale, product diversification, increasing exposure to  faster growing emerging markets, and position as the world's second largest food  and beverage company. Of PepsiCo's $66.9 billion of net revenue during the last  12 months (LTM) approximately half of its revenues are generated outside of the  United States with emerging or developing markets representing a little over  one-third of the total revenues.  PepsiCo's brand strength is demonstrated by its wide-ranging and diverse  portfolio which includes 22 brands; including Pepsi, Gatorade, Lay's, Doritos,  and Quaker, with more than $1 billion in annual retail sales that are typically  No. 1 or No. 2 in their respective categories. PepsiCo's financial profile is  supported by the strong cash generation derived from its brand strength. Annual  cash flow from operations (CFO) and free cash flow (FCF) have averaged $8.9  billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, for the past four years. Fitch expects PepsiCo to generate in the range of $10 billion in CFO and at  least $3 billion in FCF for 2014 driven by its cost savings initiatives.  PepsiCo's LTM CFO was $9.7 billion as of Sept. 6, 2014. PepsiCo's primary goals  are investing in its business, returning cash to shareholders, and maintaining  credit ratings that provide ready access to global capital and credit markets  including tier 1 commercial paper.  PepsiCo's financial strategy, historically viewed as aggressive, is also  factored into its ratings. The company has experienced pressure from an activist  investor, and has indicated plans to increase shareholder-friendly initiatives  for 2014 by more than $2 billion or approximately 35%. PepsiCo increased share  repurchase expectations to $5 billion for 2014 from $3 billion in 2013. Share  buybacks had averaged $2.3 billion per year, net of stock options and tax  benefit, since 2010. During the first three quarters of 2014, PepsiCo  repurchased $2.6 billion shares of common stock net of stock options and tax  benefit. During 2014, PepsiCo increased the dividend per share by 15% to $2.62 per share  for an approximate annual dividend of $3.7 billion. The company's dividend per  share has typically grown annually by 6% or more over the past several years,  with a total dividend of $3.4 billion for 2013. Consequently, Fitch views these  plans negatively from a credit perspective as PepsiCo will further leverage its  balance sheet to fund increased shareholder return, leaving modest ratings  headroom. However, PepsiCo's current anticipated leverage for 2014 is still  within Fitch's rating expectations albeit at the high end. PepsiCo's challenges include global concerns with health and wellness trends,  increased excise taxes on its products in certain markets, mature developed  markets, and continued negative sentiment toward artificial sweeteners that has  resulted in U.S. diet carbonated soft drinks (CSD) volume declines in the upper  single digits. Several of PepsiCo's developed markets are more mature with  stagnant or declining per capita consumption trends, weak economies and/or low  population growth. This places more dependence on growth in emerging markets and  on new product innovation, thus likely increasing the firm's longer-term  operating risk.  Notably, PepsiCo maintains a good breadth of products across its beverage  segment with strong positions in its non-carbonated soft drinks to balance the  declines within its CSD portfolio. However, PepsiCo and the rest of the industry  must develop new beverage products that are healthier, natural-sweetener-based  with lower calorie options to successfully evolve their portfolios. Fitch  anticipates that innovation will not fully ameliorate the continued CSD declines  in some developed markets due to changing habits, which are driving some  consumers to leave the carbonated soft drink category for healthier options.  Operationally, PepsiCo is focused on increasing brand support to grow market  share, expanding its emerging market presence, growing its nutrition business,  reducing overhead, and leveraging technology and processes across its  organization. PepsiCo has made noticeable progress on this strategy; therefore,  Fitch believes PepsiCo's strategic initiatives should help the company improve  trends. Furthermore, PepsiCo announced an incremental five-year $5 billion  productivity cost savings program that, if achieved, should allow the company  significant financial flexibility to reinvest in the business.  Credit Statistics  For 2Q'14, total debt-to-operating EBITDA was 2.5x, operating EBITDA-to-gross  interest expense was 14.6, and funds from operations (FFO) adjusted leverage was  3.5x. PepsiCo's leverage is modestly higher than similarly rated food and  beverage companies but ratings are supported by, as mentioned previously, the  company's substantial and stable FCF, significant scale, diversification, and  brand leadership. Fitch believes downside ratings risk is present if PepsiCo  further increases debt to fund higher shareholder returns.  Fitch's ratings reflect expectations that total debt-to-operating EBITDA  leverage will rise to the 2.4x to 2.5x range for 2014, which further reduces  flexibility at its current rating. PepsiCo's cash flow growth should benefit  from its strategic initiatives around brand support and productivity as savings  are realized. PepsiCo's 2014 operating cash flow will not be materially affected  by pension and retirement medical plan contributions. PepsiCo's U.S. pension is  well-funded at approximately 97% as the company expects to make global  contributions of approximately $190 million in 2014 compared to payments of  almost $1.5 billion in 2012.  Liquidity, Covenants, and Maturities:  PepsiCo maintains good liquidity. At the end of 3Q'14, the firm had $12.9  billion of cash and short-term investments, with $12 billion of it offshore.  This compares to $6.6 billion of cash with $5.3 billion offshore in 2012.  PepsiCo has combined capacity of $7.545 billion under its 364-day and five-year  revolving credit facilities. PepsiCo's revolvers expire in June 2015 and June  2019, respectively, and are not bound by financial covenants. Fitch recognizes  that repatriation of cash could result in incremental taxes but believes PepsiCo  would more likely use the cash to grow in overseas markets. Upcoming maturities  of long-term debt are $4.1 billion in 2015 and $3.1 billion in 2016. PepsiCo had  issued $5 billion in commercial paper as of Sept. 6, 2014, an increase of  approximately $2 billion from the end of 2013. PepsiCo guarantees all of the senior notes of its bottling subsidiaries -  Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company (PMBC) which is wholly owned by PepsiCo  and Bottling Group, LLC (wholly owned by PMBC). While the notes of PMBC and  Bottling Group, LLC are structurally superior to the notes issued by PepsiCo,  Inc., Fitch has chosen not to make a distinction in the ratings at the single-A  level as default risk is very low.  RATING SENSITIVITIES  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA below 2x and Fitch's belief that PepsiCo would  manage its balance sheet to sustain an 'A+' rating. Currently, Fitch does not  view this as likely given the increase in cash returned to shareholders.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include:  --Significant debt-financed acquisitions and/or deteriorating operating  performance that causes total debt-to-operating EBITDA to be sustained above the  mid-2.5x level;  --Substantial and sustained declines in cash flow would also likely prompt  negative rating actions;  --Financial policy changes including higher level of share repurchases or  dividends that would increase financial leverage.  Fitch's currently rates PepsiCo as follows:  PepsiCo (Parent) --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'; --Bank credit facilities 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper program 'F1'.  Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc. (Operating Company/Intermediate  Holding Co.) --Long-term IDR 'A'; --Guaranteed senior notes 'A'.  Bottling Group, LLC (Operating Company) --Long-term IDR 'A'; --Guaranteed senior notes 'A'.  Contact:  Primary Analyst  William Densmore Senior Director +1-312-368-3125 Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

70,"  (Recasts, adds background, details from conference call and new share price)By Anjali AthavaleyOct 21 Coca-Cola Co on Tuesday announced new cost-cutting measures and a timeline for selling its bottling operations after its quarterly profit slumped 14 percent and the world's largest beverage maker struggles to find growth amid a soft market for soda.The Atlanta-based company said it would hand back, or refranchise, about two-thirds of its North American bottling territories by the end of 2017, and a substantial portion of the remaining territories no later than 2020.It is the clearest timeline that Coke has given to date as it seeks to sell the bottling operations to franchisees in a bid to shift away from the capital intensive and low-margin business of distribution.Coke also said that it was targeting $3 billion in cost savings by 2019, up from its announcement in February of $1 billion. But the moves failed to impress investors. Coke shares were down 6 percent to $40.54 on Tuesday morning and down 1.8 percent this year while the S&P 500 was up 4.3 percent.Coke is grappling with deteriorating economic conditions in major emerging markets as well as softness in consumer spending in the United States and Europe.""This is placing strong pressure on the short-term performance of our business,"" said Chief Executive Muhtar Kent on the company's earnings conference call. U.S. sales of carbonated soft drinks have been declining for nearly a decade, and more recently, consumers have shifted away from diet soda because of health concerns over artificial sweeteners.Coke has tried to diversify its business by taking a smaller stake in companies in faster-growing markets and in some cases, eventually acquiring them. In August, Coca-Cola said it was buying a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp. Earlier this year, it bought a 10 percent stake in Keurig Green Mountain Inc which it raised to 16 percent in May to become Keurig's largest shareholder.Still, analysts said investors have been agitating for further cost-cutting. On the earnings conference call, Kent declined to give specifics on how much of the $3 billion would be reinvested in operations as opposed to flowing through to the bottom line but said the company would achieve a balance. Industry watchers also have been waiting for more specifics on Coke's North American bottling operations. Following a similar move by rival PepsiCo Inc, Coke bought back its top bottler in the region in 2010 to streamline decision-making and cut costs.The company also said it expected to miss its long-term earnings growth target in 2014, due in part to currency fluctuations.Net income for the third quarter declined to $2.1 billion, or 48 cents a share, from $2.4 billion, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier.Excluding charges for refranchising some North American bottling operations and other special items, earnings per share were 53 cents, in line with analysts' expectations.Overall revenue was flat at $11.97 billion versus expectations of $12.12 billion.

74,"  More than 300 companies, including PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), AIG Inc (AIG.N) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), secured secret deals from Luxembourg to slash their tax bills, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) reported, quoting leaked documents.The companies appear to have channeled hundreds of billions of dollars through Luxembourg and saved billions of dollars in taxes, the group of investigative journalists said, based on a review of nearly 28,000 pages of confidential documents. The leaked documents reviewed by ICIJ journalists include hundreds of private tax rulings – known as comfort letters – that Luxembourg provides to corporations seeking favorable tax treatment.Luxembourg officials denied any ""sweetheart deals"" in its tax system.

75,"  Nov 5 More than 300 companies, including PepsiCo Inc, AIG Inc and Deutsche Bank AG, secured secret deals from Luxembourg to slash their tax bills, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) reported, quoting leaked documents.The companies appear to have channeled hundreds of billions of dollars through Luxembourg and saved billions of dollars in taxes, the group of investigative journalists said, based on a review of nearly 28,000 pages of confidential documents. (bit.ly/1zwPjbv)The leaked documents reviewed by ICIJ journalists include hundreds of private tax rulings - known as comfort letters - that Luxembourg provides to corporations seeking favorable tax treatment. Luxembourg officials denied any ""sweetheart deals"" in its tax system. ""The Luxembourg system of taxation is competitive - there is nothing unfair or unethical about it,"" ICIJ quoted Nicolas Mackel, chief executive of Luxembourg for Finance, as saying in an interview.

76,"   By Alastair Macdonald and Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS A storm of outrage over Luxembourg's role in helping global companies avoid tax plunged its former leader into controversy in his first week running the European Commission, the EU body that polices tax abuses.Jean-Claude Juncker, 59, who took over as president of the EU executive after more than two decades as finance minister and prime minister of the tiny Grand Duchy, pulled out of a speaking engagement on Thursday. He repeated through a spokesman a remark made the previous day denying a conflict of interest and saying he would not hinder existing EU investigations of Luxembourg.And for all the sharp words from political opponents to his left, there seemed little threat to his five-year mandate. Many critics focused instead on calls for both Juncker and his successor in Luxembourg to follow through on commitments to change and to promote a level playing field for taxes in Europe and worldwide.Controversy over the role of Luxembourg (population half a million) as a low-tax conduit for corporate cash has long been a feature of Juncker's political career. Some weeks ago, the Commission of his predecessor began investigations of tax deals struck there by web retailer Amazon and Italian carmaker Fiat.Ireland and Malta are also under scrutiny by EU antitrust investigators for possibly having offered some companies competitive advantages through sweetheart tax deals.However, the publication of documents by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists indicated more than 300 companies had secret deals to slash global tax bills - and that has turned up the heat on Luxembourg, and on Juncker""These revelations are a major blow to the credibility of new Commission president Junker and his capacity to act for the public interest,"" said Sven Giegold, finance spokesman for the Greens in the European Parliament, who called Juncker ""directly complicit in this mass corporate tax avoidance"".""The Commission must now set out a comprehensive action plan against tax dumping,"" Giegold added. ""Only by doing so can Juncker begin the path to redemption and try and dispel the doubts about his conflict of interest."" The chief Commission spokesman recalled Juncker's words on Wednesday - ""The Commission will do its work. I will refrain from intervening."" He also noted Juncker had committed himself to seeking a common EU framework for corporate taxation when he was campaigning for his job during May's EU parliament election.INVESTIGATIONS PURSUED The new competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager of Denmark, was pursuing inquiries into Luxembourg and may open further investigations, spokesman Margaritis Schinas said during nearly an hour of news conference questions on Juncker's position.  ""Mrs. Vestager will push this through to the end,"" he said, adding that Juncker himself was ""relaxed"" amid the controversy.Vestager said that her office had yet to take a view on the legality of Luxembourg's tax deals but vowed to ""enforce state aid control in fair and justified manner"".Schinas characterized the examination of Luxembourg's use of tax policy to bolster its economy as ""typical"" of investigations into a variety of governments' use of incentives for industry. In some cases, those incentives were deemed illegal ""state aid"". Prime Minister Xavier Bettel, who succeeded Juncker a year ago, said his country had not broken any rules and it was not alone in allowing tax schemes for big companies. [ID:nL6N0SW3V9]      Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna told reporters in Brussels that Luxembourg would work with other states to level the tax playing field: ""The moment that there is a recognition in the international community that fiscal matters must be equitable and the information should be shared, then Luxembourg would have no problem going in the direction of more transparency.""He offered a defense of Juncker, saying it was wrong to single out ""one politician for a particular period of time"".However, Britain's euro-skeptical UK Independence Party did not miss the opportunity to target the new Commission chief personally, calling the tax affair ""more proof that the EU elite protect their friends in high corporate places"".But more significant for Juncker's ability to weather the storm may be a statement from his center-left opponent for the job, Martin Schulz, the speaker of the European Parliament: ""I am confident that the European Commission will check the cases with regard to potential breaches of EU law and will take all appropriate actions swiftly and if necessary,"" Schulz said.""What worries me most is the fact that the reported practices were manifestly legally possible,"" the German Social Democrat said. ""This reality means that we need to urge the member states to work with us to end systematic tax evasion practices in Europe, be it in Luxemburg or any other country.""

Both teens and 6-to-11-year-olds saw more television ads for Red Bull. A Pepsi spokesman called the findings misleading.

PepsiCo points to its recent performance: It has beat analyst estimates for earnings per share for 11 quarters in a row and raised its full-year earnings forecast in October.In a statement, Peltz said, ""We support Indra's commitment to operational excellence, which has resulted in improved performance of the company. We are confident that Bill will be a strong and complementary addition to the PepsiCo Board."" Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, called Johnson's election a surprising twist, noting his close relationship with investment firm 3G Capital Partners. 3G teamed up with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc to buy Heinz in 2013.""This certainly does suggest a more open stance by PepsiCo to entertain M&A, perhaps even with 3G,"" Dibadj said in a note.

89,"   By Kevin Allison | CHICAGO  CHICAGO (Reuters Breakingviews) - Nelson Peltz has brought his activist record full circle. At the billionaire activist's recommendation, PepsiCo has agreed to add Bill Johnson to its board. The former Heinz boss tussled with Peltz in 2006 but later became an adviser to his Trian fund. Johnson's evolution from adversary to ally shows why even activists should try to win friends, not make enemies.The appointment defuses the near two-year battle between Peltz and Pepsi Chief Executive Indra Nooyi over the soda and snack producer's strategic direction. As recently as July, Peltz publicly hinted he might launch a proxy contest if the group didn't bow to Trian's demands. But the veteran of activist tilts at Cadbury, Wendy's, and Kraft praised Pepsi and its new board member on Friday.Johnson, a consumer-industry veteran who stepped down from Heinz after presiding over the ketchup maker's sale to Warren Buffett and a trio of Brazilian billionaires in 2013, is quite a catch regardless of his connection to Trian. His experience and reputation mean Pepsi can feel reasonably confident he'll express his own mind in the boardroom.Still, his affinity with Peltz is unusual. Nine years ago, Johnson's Heinz was embroiled in a proxy fight with the investor. At one point, he warned employees that the activist's cost-cutting plans would ""cripple the company."" Yet the CEO ended up staying on after Trian won two board seats. The ability to tap a former target as a board nominee is a reminder that Peltz's characteristically restrained form of activism may have some advantages over the kind in which slanging matches may hinder future reconciliation.Peltz and his founding partners Peter May and Edward Garden have a reputation for long-term thinking and constructive criticism. At least for now, activism accommodates many other styles, too. In the cycle of finance, though, what goes around tends to come around again. The Peltz-Johnson example suggests that it pays not to burn too many bridges. CONTEXT NEWS  - PepsiCo said on Jan. 16 that it had elected an adviser at Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management to its board of directors, signaling a truce between the company and the activist investor.- Bill Johnson, the former chairman and chief executive of Heinz, will join the board on March 23 and will be included in the slate of nominees for election to the board at Pepsi's 2015 annual shareholder meeting, according to the company.- The appointment follows a near two-year campaign by Trian to convince the soda maker to split its beverage and snack divisions.- Johnson was CEO at Heinz when Trian launched a proxy fight at the ketchup maker in 2006.

90,"  * Faces competition from likely Keurig Green Mountain launch* CEO says SodaStream will not give up top market spot* Demand for sparkling water on the rise* SodaStream to expand partnership with PepsiCoBy Tova CohenAIRPORT CITY, Israel, Feb 9 Facing new competition from the expected launch of Keurig Green Mountain Inc's at-home soda machine in 2015, top player SodaStream International is seeking to appeal to increasingly health-oriented consumers.As U.S. demand for sweet soft drinks declines, SodaStream in October cut its 2014 revenue and profit forecast and said it would close a controversial factory in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, that had sparked calls for a boycott of its products. At the same time, competition is heating up. Keurig's upcoming cold beverage system is being developed with help from Coca-Cola, which became Keurig's largest shareholder last year when it bought a 16 percent stake.""We are not about to relinquish our number one position in the U.S. or anywhere. We are looking forward to healthy competition,"" Chief Executive Daniel Birnbaum said on the sidelines of a news conference to launch its new product line.SodaStream, whose revenue grew 30 percent a year on average since 2008, reaching $562.7 million in 2013, forecast a 9 percent drop in 2014. Its stock on Nasdaq has fallen almost 60 percent since last April when it hit a high for 2014 of $47.30, and is now trading at $19.90. ""I think we failed in 2014 because we didn't identify quickly enough the change in the market,"" Birnbaum said.""U.S. consumers don't want better Coke, they want more interesting water.""Demand for sparkling water is on the rise, with the U.S. market up 33 percent to nearly $1.5 billion in 2013. This trend continued in 2014, Birnbaum said. In response, SodaStream is launching a line of flavoured waters, some with no calories and others with added fibres and vitamins. It will also sell its first electric soda machine.Birnbaum said the company's $65 million annual marketing budget will be dedicated to this new line.SodaStream is also expanding its partnership with PepsiCo  and will begin selling capsules in New Jersey to make Pepsi and Sierra Mist sodas at home. The capsules are already sold in Florida.The company is also in the process of closing down its contested West Bank facility.It has received permits to bring in 100 Palestinians workers from that plant to a new factory in Israel. Birnbaum said SodaStream was seeking to obtain more permits for Palestinian workers as is needed.

If other beverage companies like Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (DPS.N) and Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O) also report increases, soda company investors will view it as a good start to the year.""The more reinforcement that you get of a constructive pricing environment, the better it is for its prospects for 2015,"" said UBS analyst Stephen Powers.He added that the 4 percent increase ""certainly exceeded our expectations...I would be very impressed if they could sustain that run rate.""

""Competitors could take advantage of those and play the price game and hence, gain market share,"" said Jack Russo, an analyst at Edward Jones, in an email. The increase does not mean Coke hiked the prices on all the products it sells. Beverage companies can raise prices through the mix of products and packaging they offer. Coke and PepsiCo have said that smaller portion sizes, which enable them to charge higher prices per fluid ounce, have been popular with U.S. consumers. The company said on its earnings conference call that mini-can sales rose 15 percent in the quarter.Investors care about Coke's prices because sales volumes have been sluggish. Raising prices is one way a company can try to boost profitability and offset currency impacts in overseas markets.For Coke, North American profitability is important to watch since the company is in the process of selling off its bottling operations in the region, and boosting profit margins would help tempt would-be franchisees.  Coke said commodities were unlikely to have much of an effect on pricing. On the company's earnings conference call, Irial Finan, president of bottling investments, said Coke had found a balance between prices and volume growth in North America.

105,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 03 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of PepsiCo,  Inc. (PepsiCo), Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc., and Bottling  Group, LLC at 'A'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. PepsiCo had approximately  $28.9 billion of total debt at the end of 2014. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of the press release. KEY RATING DRIVERS  Brand Strength and Scale PepsiCo's ratings reflect its considerable financial flexibility, substantial  cash flow, significant scale, product diversification, increasing exposure to  faster growing emerging markets, and position as the world's second largest food  and beverage company. Fitch estimates PepsiCo's $66.7 billion of net revenue  during the last 12 months was roughly an equal split between food and beverages.  Approximately half of PepsiCo's revenue is generated outside of the United  States with developing markets representing a little over one-third of total  revenue based on estimates of 2013 data.  PepsiCo's brand strength is demonstrated by its portfolio which consists of 22  brands, including Pepsi, Gatorade, Lay's, Doritos, and Quaker, with more than $1  billion in annual retail sales, that are typically No. 1 or No. 2 in their  respective categories. PepsiCo's financial profile is supported by the strong  cash generation derived from its brand strength and high margins. Annual cash  flow from operations (CFO) and free cash flow (FCF) have averaged $9.4 billion  and $3.1 billion, respectively, for the past four years. Fitch expects PepsiCo  to generate CFO in the low $10 billion range and FCF of approximately $3.5  billion for 2015 which is supported by its cost savings initiatives. PepsiCo's  primary goals are investing in its business, returning cash to shareholders, and  maintaining credit ratings that provide ready access to global capital and  credit markets including tier 1 commercial paper (CP).  Aggressive Financial Strategy PepsiCo's financial strategy, historically viewed as aggressive, is also  factored into its ratings. PepsiCo increased shareholder-friendly initiatives  during 2014 by more than $2 billion to $8.7 billion, or approximately 35%, due  in part to activist investor pressure. Expectations for 2015 are in a similar  same range of $8.5 billion to $9 billion. Fitch views these plans negatively  from a credit perspective, as debt-funded share repurchases can pressure the  balance sheet, leaving modest ratings headroom. Negative rating triggers include  a more aggressive share repurchase policy that leads to sustained leverage in  excess of 2.5x. However, during the fourth quarter 2014, PepsiCo remitted $6 billion of  international cash to the U.S. through a return of basis, which Fitch views as a  credit positive to repay CP borrowings. This return of basis and debt repayment  resulted in lower than expected leverage of 2.2x compared with Fitch's  expectations of 2.4x-2.5x. PepsiCo's leverage is modestly higher than similarly  rated companies but ratings are supported by, as mentioned previously, the  company's substantial and stable FCF, significant scale, diversification, and  brand leadership. PepsiCo pursued a return-of-basis distribution, which has negligible tax  consequences, as a result of a build-up in foreign cash. Fitch generally  believes multi-nationals may be reluctant to repatriate foreign earnings due to  tax consequences. Fitch estimates foreign cash would have increased to $13.4  billion at the end of 2014 compared with the $7.4 billion PepsiCo reported.  Absent additional return of basis distributions, Fitch estimates PepsiCo will  need to borrow in the range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion domestically in 2015  due to the considerable cash requirements associated with the $4.5 billion to $5  billion share repurchase program, the $4 billion annual dividend, and domestic  capital investment in excess of $1 billion. Whether PepsiCo would consider  additional return-of-basis distributions is unclear.  Operating Challenges PepsiCo's challenges include global concern with health and wellness trends,  increased excise taxes on its products in certain markets, the maturity of its  categories in developed markets, and continued negative sentiment toward  artificial sweeteners that led to U.S. diet carbonated soft drink (CSD) volume  declines in the upper single digits. Several of PepsiCo's developed markets have  stagnant or declining per capita CSD consumption trends, weak economies and/or  low population growth. Weak volume trends in developed markets places more  dependence on emerging markets which have experienced more recent volatility and  slowing growth.  New product innovation will also be key to stemming concerns around health and  wellness and consumers' growing preference away from artificial ingredients,  thus potentially increasing the firm's longer-term operating risk. PepsiCo  maintains a good breadth of products across its beverage segment with strong  positions in its non-carbonated soft drinks to balance the declines within its  CSD portfolio. However, PepsiCo and the rest of the industry must continue to  successfully develop new beverage products that are healthier, natural  sweetener-based with lower calorie options to evolve their portfolios. Fitch  anticipates that innovation will not fully ameliorate the continued CSD declines  in some developed markets due to changing habits that are causing some consumers  to leave the category for healthier options.  Operationally, PepsiCo is focused on increasing brand support to grow market  share, expanding its emerging market presence, growing its nutrition business,  reducing overhead, and leveraging technology and processes across its  organization. PepsiCo has made noticeable progress on this strategy therefore  Fitch believes the company's strategic initiatives should help it improve  trends. Furthermore, PepsiCo's five-year $5 billion productivity cost savings  program, if achieved, should provide the company significant financial  flexibility to either reinvest into the business and/or increase cash  generation.  Liquidity, Maturities and Guarantees:  PepsiCo maintains good liquidity. As mentioned previously, during the fourth  quarter 2014, PepsiCo remitted $6 billion of international cash to the U.S.  through a return of basis, which was used to reduce CP borrowings to $746  million at the end of 2014. PepsiCo's cash and short-term investments totaled  $8.7 billion for 2014, of which $7.4 billion was offshore. PepsiCo has a  combined capacity of $7.545 billion under its 364-day and five-year revolving  credit facilities maturing in 2019 that remains undrawn. Upcoming maturities of  long-term debt are $4.1 billion in 2015 and $3.1 billion in 2016.  PepsiCo guarantees all of the senior notes of its bottling subsidiaries -  Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company (PMBC), which is wholly owned by  PepsiCo, and Bottling Group, LLC (wholly owned by PMBC). While the notes of PMBC  and Bottling Group, LLC are structurally superior to the notes issued by  PepsiCo, Inc., Fitch has chosen not to make a distinction in the ratings at the  single-A level as default risk is very low.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Additional key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: --Revenue decrease of approximately 2.5% in 2015. Assumptions includes a  combined 1% revenue decline in the food segments of Frito-Lay, Quaker Foods and  Latin America Foods (6% decrease due to foreign exchange). In the PepsiCo  America Beverages segment, assumptions include a 1% decline in revenue (3%  decrease due to foreign exchange). In the Europe segment, assumptions include a  13% decline in revenue (16% decrease due to foreign exchange). --PepsiCo retains at least $1 billion of domestic cash throughout the forecast; --In 2015, PepsiCo increases debt by approximately $3.5 billion to fund domestic  cash requirements of at least $10 billion including $5 billion in share  repurchases, $4 billion in dividends and $1.2 billion in capital investment; --PepsiCo does not remit any additional foreign cash for return of basis,  allowing offshore cash to increase in excess of $10 billion; --FCF for 2015 is approximately $3.4 billion reflecting total capital spending  of $3 billion; --Total leverage increases to 2.4x in 2015. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include:  --Total debt-to-operating EBITDA below 2x and Fitch's belief that PepsiCo would  manage its balance sheet to sustain an 'A+' rating. Currently, Fitch does not  view this as likely given the increase in cash returned to shareholders.  Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a negative  rating action include: --Significant debt-financed acquisitions and/or deteriorating operating  performance that causes total debt-to-operating EBITDA to be sustained above the  mid-2x level;  --Substantial and sustained declines in cash flow would also likely prompt  negative rating actions;  --Financial policy changes including higher level of share repurchases or  dividends that would increase financial leverage.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  PepsiCo (Parent) --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Bank credit facilities at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper program at 'F1'. Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc. (Operating Company/Intermediate  Holding Co.): --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --Guaranteed senior notes at 'A'. Bottling Group, LLC (Operating Company): --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --Guaranteed senior notes at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

109,"  (Corrects to say profit fell, not grew, in 2nd paragraph)SHANGHAI, March 23 China's largest food and beverage maker Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding Corp  said net profit fell 2 percent in 2014, while a slowing economy and fierce competition dragged sales down for the first time in almost two decades. Hong Kong-listed Tingyi, owner of the Master Kong brand and a partner with PepsiCo Inc and Starbucks Corp  in China, said on Monday profit for the year fell to $400.5 million, down from $408.5 million a year earlier.

126,"  * Private equity mentality spreads in consumer sector* Highlights importance of financial prowess* JAB, Nomad Foods have links to 3G-controlled AB InBevBy Martinne GellerLONDON, May 21 The consumer goods world has long been dominated by marketing whiz kids raised through the ranks of Procter & Gamble or PepsiCo, but the executives now in demand come from a new school that values cost-cutting and mergers over marketing.The new playbook, embodied by U.S. private equity firm 3G Capital, applies cutthroat Wall Street sensibilities to Main Street shopping aisles, demanding the highest performance from  fewer people willing to work extra hard and progress quickly.The spread of a private equity mentality to more of the largest names in the sector exacerbates the pressure on finance chiefs, already wading through increased volatility of commodities and currencies, and highlights the need for financial prowess outside the finance department.The 3G management philosophy was developed by three Brazilian investment bankers and pioneered at Budweiser brewer Anheuser Busch InBev, the world's biggest brewer, which they helped create through a series of big mergers. It is now also in effect at Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International where they are major shareholders, and ketchup maker Heinz which they have bought. Soon it will arrive at Kraft Foods, which is being bought by Heinz.The Brazilians have demonstrated that the private equity model can be implemented on a large scale, potentially creating big winners and losers in a low-growth sector.Private equity firms in general are known for a more aggressive culture than marketing-focused consumer goods companies, with more competition and a higher turnover rate among executives, said Gary Stibel, CEO of New England Consulting Group. He said more consumer firms are adopting some of those philosophies, but it is not always a good fit.""They have a maniacal focus on cash and results,"" Stibel said. ""You've got to be very careful about putting a bull in a china shop unless you're prepared to have a lot of broken glass.""After 3G teamed up with billionaire investor Warren Buffett to buy Heinz in 2013, they closed six factories and cut 7,000 jobs in 18 months. Operating margins jumped from 18 percent to 26 percent. Part of the 3G playbook is zero-based budgeting (ZBB), which forces managers to justify each year's costs from scratch rather than assume the previous year's budget as a starting point.While 3G is often seen as extreme - at Heinz they limited employee use of company printers to 200 pages per month, required double-sided printing - ZBB is being adopted elsewhere, such as at Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez International .Executives familiar with the strategy are in demand as other companies seek to repeat the trick.""Anyone who worked at ABI (AB InBev) or Heinz under the 3G regime would be very appealing to the market, because of their familiarity with ZBB,"" said Fabio Vacirca, head of the consumer goods and services group at consultancy Accenture.As industry-wide sales have slowed for packaged food makers such as Kellogg, Campbell Soup and General Mills , all eyes have turned to profits.3G's founders Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira developed their management style at Banco Garantia, the investment bank they founded in Brazil in the 1970s. After selling it to Credit Suisse in 1998, they formed private equity firm 3G to invest in U.S. consumer names. Lemann, Brazil's richest man and a former tennis pro, once served on the board of Gillette, where he met Buffett, who has partnered with Lemann on Heinz and Kraft and has said he would like to do more deals.CFO TURNOVER A shakeup in finance departments throughout the packaged goods sector suggests the emphasis on dealmaking and cost-cutting is putting new pressure on a side of the business that used to take a back seat to marketing.Unilever announced the departure of its chief financial officer Jean-Marc Huet on Tuesday, becoming the fifth major consumer products firm to change the post in recent months, following Heineken, Danone, Nestle  and SABMiller.""Maybe it is just becoming a more pressurized and intense job as the CFOs are being required to actually become more operationally involved in all that cost-cutting rather than just adding up the numbers,"" said one investment bank analyst covering the sector, who declined to be identified by name. Since the credit crunch, companies have been increasingly naming finance experts as CEOs and board members, ""because it's been more about management of those risks as opposed to the more expansive agenda that perhaps marketeers had traditionally been better suited to,"" said Will Hayllar, co-leader of the global consumer goods team at OC&C Strategy Consultants.Dealmaking activity is requiring a lot of attention from top executives, SABMiller's interim CFO, Domenic De Lorenzo, told reporters last week: ""Conversations, evaluations, looking at transactions, that's still a big part of everyone's day-to-day job in this industry.""Many of the dealmakers and financiers taking up top jobs in the industry have outright connections to 3G and AB InBev.Stefan Descheemaeker, the executive who led Belgium's Interbrew into the merger that formed the precursor to AB InBev, will soon take charge of Birdseye frozen foods owner Iglo Foods as the new CEO of acquisition firm Nomad Holdings.Olivier Goudet, a veteran of the 2008 takeover of Wrigley by Mars, has been named as both the new chairman of AB InBev and as CEO at JAB Holdings, the family office of the German billionaire Reimann family which is putting together the world's largest pure-play coffee company. JAB's former CEO Peter Harf also served as AB InBev chairman.The tumult helps the sector to be seen as a hot field for aspiring managers. Work in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector became the most popular destination for business students last year, eclipsing banking for the first time, according to a global survey by Deloitte.Deloitte's Margaret Doyle, who worked on the report, pointed to an increased number of female students, who she said often lean toward marketing jobs, and a weakening of the banking industry, whose reputation was bruised by the financial crisis.""FMCG companies have always been perceived as having well-regarded graduate programmes,"" said Doyle, head of financial services insight at Deloitte. ""People are initiated through different parts of the business - they get to market shampoo, market washing powder, they experience a real rotation which is a great foundation.""Procter & Gamble for decades was seen as one of the best breeding grounds for business executives, due to its world-class talent programme and reputation for promoting from within. Aside from consumer leaders like Unilever CEO Paul Polman and Estee Lauder CEO Fabrizio Freda, P&G alums include General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt and former Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer.Yet industry bankers said they could they could see why new graduates might like to work for 3G, despite its culture being so thrifty that even top executives abide by restrictions on travel and entertainment.""Come to them, and they'll teach you as much about consumer products marketing as anyone else, but they'll also show you how to develop that playbook,"" said one banker.

142,"   By Lauren Hirsch and Greg Roumeliotis  PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) and Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) are in talks to invest in Chobani LLC, in a deal that the Greek yogurt maker hopes could value it at as much $3 billion, including debt, according to people familiar with the matter.The negotiations illustrate how soft drink giants are making a push to diversify beyond the slow-growth carbonated beverage sector into the U.S. consumer market's faster-growing healthy lifestyle segment.Chobani is exploring selling a minority stake, including warrants owned by private equity firm TPG Capital LP that account for between 10 percent and 20 percent of the yogurt maker's equity depending on its financial performance, the people said.Chobani is looking for a strategic investor to help expand its supply chain, distribution, manufacturing base and geographic footprint for its popular yogurts like Flip, which combine yogurt with flavors such as peanut butter and coffee, the people added.  The deal under negotiation could change and there is no certainty that either Pepsi or Coca-Cola will reach an agreement, the people said. Other companies are also in talks with Chobani about a potential investment, the people said.The sources asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. Chobani, TPG and Cola-Cola declined to comment. Pepsi did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Based in New Berlin, New York, Chobani was founded in 2005 by Turkish immigrant Hamdi Ulukaya, its majority owner and chief executive. While its yogurt has become one of the top-selling Greek brands in the United States, Chobani has also experienced some growing pains. Private equity firm TPG Capital LP gave a $750 million loan to the company last year to help it fund a turnaround.Pepsi and Coca-Cola are no strangers to the dairy sector. In 2012, Pepsi started selling yogurt through a joint venture with German dairy company Theo Müller. This year, Coca-Cola began national distribution of a milk product called FairLife, which it created through a joint venture with Select Milk Producers.  Pepsi, whose snack category includes ""better for you"" products such as Quaker Oats, as well as Frito-Lay chip and other offerings, has a broader snack portfolio than Coke. Coca-Cola has a track record of minority investments in growth consumer segments, including stakes in coffee company Keurig Green Mountain Inc GMCR.O, energy drink Monster Beverage Corp (MNST.O) and juice brand Suja Life LLC.

149,"  * Deal will strengthen JAB's position in U.S.* Offer of $92/share is a 78 percent premium* Coca-Cola to cash out 17.4 percent stake   (Adds details on JAB coffee strategy, management, market share vs Nestle)By Anjali Athavaley and Sruthi RamakrishnanDec 7 Europe's JAB Holding Co is leading a $13.9 billion buyout of Keurig Green Mountain Inc in a deal that would give it 60 percent control of North America's single-serve coffee market and advance its ambitions to build a global coffee powerhouse.The transaction, pitched at a rich 78 percent premium to Keurig's Friday closing price, would be the biggest coffee acquisition by JAB, the investment vehicle of Germany's billionaire Reimann family, as it tries to become a formidable competitor to world coffee market leader Nestle SA.For Luxembourg-based JAB, the deal for the maker of K-Cup coffee pods ""is a fantastic opportunity for them to be really a global player in the coffee market. Now they can have some scale in the U.S.,"" said Vontobel analyst Jean-Philippe Bertschy.The price represents a ""demanding valuation"" of about 15 times Keurig's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), he said. The stock was trading around eight times EBITDA last week, Bertschy said.Keurig has struggled with declining sales because of increased competition and slower-than-expected adoption of its newer 2.0 brewing machines because of consumers' confusion over which brands could be used with the devices.Analysts have also questioned the growth prospects for the company's latest countertop device, a single-serve cold drink maker called Keurig Kold, citing its high price and a disappointing rollout.As a result, shares of Keurig had lost more than 60 percent of their market value this year up to Friday's close. On Monday, the stock closed up 72 percent at $88.89, but still remained below JAB's offer price of $92 per share.The increase represented a blow to influential investor David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital and other short-sellers, who hold nearly 13 percent of the total Keurig float in a bet the shares would fall further. COFFEE POWERHOUSE JAB had long been eyeing Keurig as an acquisition target as it moved aggressively to build its presence in all aspects of the coffee business, from bagged coffee to cafes, a source familiar with the situation said.Keurig leads the $6.1 billion North American single-serve coffee market with a 61 percent market share, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. Nestle has only a small presence in that business.JAB also owns two Nordic coffeehouse chains as well as Caribou Coffee and Peet's Coffee & Tea in the United States, where the market is dominated by Starbucks. Speculation has even surfaced that JAB might be interested in Dunkin' Donuts , which has a loyal following for its coffee. Three senior partners run JAB, and its ambitions in coffee  may be modeled partly upon the global strength of acquisitive brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev, where JAB senior partner Olivier Goudet serves as chairman and JAB senior partner Peter Harf was formerly chairman.JAB in July completed the formation of a joint venture called Jacobs Douwe Egberts, now the largest pure-play coffee company by volume, combining its D.E. Master Blenders 1753 business with the coffee business of Mondelez International Inc .It still trails Nestle in global market share by retail value, with Nestle accounting for 22.7 percent of the $81 billion coffee market and Jacobs Douwe Egberts another 16.3 percent, based on 2013 data according to Euromonitor.Other major JAB holdings include controlling stakes in cosmetics company Coty Inc and luxury goods maker Jimmy Choo.COKE'S EXIT Coca-Cola Co, Keurig's biggest single shareholder, said it would receive cash for its 17.4 percent stake in the Vermont-based company for a net gain of $25.5 million on its investment. Coke bought a 10 percent stake in Keurig last year and added to its holding this year. Keurig has partnered with Coke and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc on branded pods for its Kold machine.Coke's shares were little changed at $43.20. The Atlanta-based company said in a statement that it expected to continue to collaborate with JAB on pods for Kold.While Coke has acquired companies in the past after buying a minority stake, Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said he was not surprised that this did not happen with Keurig.The soda maker is mainly interested in Keurig's cold beverage business, he said. ""It really makes more sense for someone with coffee experience to take this one on.""Shares of at-home cold beverage maker SodaStream International Ltd rose 10.6 percent to $15.51.Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Pablo Zuanic attributed the rise to the ""apparent vanishing of the (Coca-Cola) threat in at-home cold drink solutions."" But he said he doubted a buyer would emerge for SodaStream unless PepsiCo Inc was interested.JAB is acquiring Keurig in partnership with investors that are shareholders in Jacobs Douwe Egberts, including Mondelez and entities affiliated with BDT Capital Partners.The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2016. Keurig Green Mountain will be privately owned and operated independently by the company's management team. Its headquarters will remain in Waterbury, Vermont.BofA Merrill Lynch and Credit Suisse  provided fairness opinions to Keurig.(Writing by Cynthia Osterman; Additional reporting by Martinne Geller in London and Lauren Hirsch in New York; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty, Michele Gershberg, Lisa Von Ahn and Steve Orlofsky)",2015-12-07,PEP,"Mon Dec 7, 2015 | 5:07pm EST",UPDATE 6-JAB-led investor group to buy K-Cup maker Keurig for $13.9 bln,http://www.reuters.com//article/keurig-green-ma-jab-idUSL3N13W41920151207?type=companyNews

153,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON A slew of major  U.S. corporations are likely to announce in the next few weeks whether they will take big writedowns for their troubled Venezuela operations, and some may say they are leaving the country altogether. The companies may decide to slash the valuations of their businesses and take charges based on declines in some of the  oil producing nation’s four exchange rates for the bolivar currency, of which three are official and one black market, and then deconsolidate the operations on their balance sheets, Wall Street securities analysts said.They may have more reason to accelerate the process after the socialist government on Friday declared a 60-day economic emergency, which would give President Nicolas Maduro wider powers to intervene in companies or limit access to already scarce dollars in Venezuela.It also disclosed that the nation’s economy contracted by 4.5 percent in the first nine months of last year while the official annual inflation rate was the world’s highest at 141.5 percent in that period, as plunging oil prices, and what critics of Maduro see as policy missteps, took an increasing toll.    Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.    The Reuters analysis shows that U.S. companies with exposure could face total writedowns of more than $3 billion if they revalue their assets in Venezuela using the less preferential Simadi exchange rate of nearly 200 bolivars to the dollar. In the past, many companies valued their assets using the main official rate of 6.3 bolivars per dollar.     But even that change may not reveal the full extent of the problem given that the black market exchange rate has worsened to about 878 bolivars to the dollar from about 190 bolivars a year ago, according to dolartoday.com, a website that tracks the rate.        MONITORING DAY-BY-DAY     Increased government regulations and lack of access to U.S. dollars at lower rates could force companies such as Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co to deconsolidate if they lose further control over their operations. Goodyear said in recent financial disclosures that a deconsolidation move would trigger a one-time, pre-tax charge of more than $500 million and what it termed “derecognition” of $293 million of cash on its balance sheet. Goodyear was not immediately available for comment. At a Jan. 12 investor conference, Goodyear Chief Financial Officer Laura Thompson described Venezuela as “a very volatile environment.”“The outlook is pretty uncertain. Our visibility is unclear, but we continue to monitor the situation day-by-day, quarter-by-quarter, as we go,” Thompson said.Deconsolidation under U.S. accounting rules allow companies to treat a subsidiary in a volatile foreign market as an investment rather than an operating unit, while writing down the market value of that subsidiary largely insulates the parent company from future hits to its financial results.So far, blue-chip companies that have deconsolidated in Venezuela and written off nearly all of their investment there include Procter & Gamble Co, Pepsico Inc and Ford Motor Co. Among those who have departed altogether is cleaning products maker Clorox Co.One major pressure point could be drug companies. Abbott Laboratories, Abbvie Inc, Merck & Co Inc, Pfizer Inc and Zoetis Inc have about $1.8 billion in combined net monetary assets exposed to the bolivar, recent U.S. regulatory filings show.Zoetis, which declined to comment for this story, began scaling back operations in Venezuela several months ago, executives have said previously. Pfizer, Merck and Abbvie did not return messages seeking comment. Abbott declined to comment.These companies’ preferential access to dollars at the official exchange rate has become more difficult, even as the government has made availability of drugs a priority. But the economic crisis has worsened so much that now less business is being done at the official rate, even for essential food and medicine.The government also has another lower official rate known as the Sicad rate – that has been at around 13 bolivars to the dollar – but there are also very few dollars available at that rate. The last Sicad auction was in September.    Meanwhile, it is not uncommon for U.S. companies to have currency exchange settlements pending with the Venezuelan government for years, U.S. regulatory filings show.SUSPENDED SHIPMENTS Other companies selling sensitive products, such as baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co, have had to adjust their practices because of constraints placed by the Venezuelan government on the release of U.S. dollars to repatriate cash back to the United States. Mead suspended shipments to Venezuela temporarily, the company said during an October investor day presentation. The company was not available for comment.Consumer products maker Newell Rubbermaid Inc has been identified by some Wall Street analysts as the next major U.S. company that will likely take action to protect itself from Venezuela's crumbling economy.""We continue to view a deconsolidation (in Venezuela) as a likely event"" when Newell reports fourth-quarter results on Jan 29, analysts at Jefferies Companies said last week in a research note.If Newell were to deconsolidate it would take a one-time charge of $111 million, according to company commentary in recent U.S. regulatory filings. Newell declined to comment for this story.Such a move would largely protect the company from taking further Venezuela-related hits to its financial results in the future.Among U.S. companies, Oreo cookies and Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez International Inc has one of the largest remaining exposures to Venezuela, with $617 million in net assets, according to the Reuters analysis of corporate disclosures.""We would expect to provide an update on Venezuela and other markets when we announce our (fourth quarter) earnings on Feb. 3, but I’m not able to provide comment before that time due to quiet period,” said Mondelez spokeswoman Valerie Moens.Besides Newell and Goodyear, 3M Co, Colgate Palmolive Co and Herbalife Ltd have at least raised the specter of insulating their financial results from Venezuela. In U.S. regulatory filings over the past three months, the companies have talked about deconsolidation if conditions in Venezuela continue to deteriorate.     Toy maker Mattel Inc has said it may consider ceasing operations in Venezuela.

Demand was strong for its Naked cold-pressed fruit and vegetable juices and Lipton teas, the company said.  ""We broadened our beverage portfolio to lessen our reliance on colas..."" Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said, adding that just 12 percent of revenue now comes from Pepsi colas and less than 25 percent from fizzy drinks globally.   Cost of sales fell 6.4 percent as raw material prices declined.

168,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan  PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit as it trimmed costs and demand rose in North America for its snacks, which include Cheetos and Lay's chips.The company's shares rose as much as 0.8 percent to $104.59 in morning trading on Monday. PepsiCo has handled sliding demand for fizzy sodas better than rival Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) as its snacks business has offset much of the impact of a shift in consumer tastes to teas, fruit juices and smoothies. The maker of Tropicana juices is also trying to attract health-conscious consumers with snacks such as Smartfoods Delight popcorn and gluten-free Quaker oats. Sales in its North America snacks business, which accounts for over a quarter of total revenue, rose 3 percent in the first quarter ended March 19. Global beverage volumes rose 3 percent, excluding the impact of currency, acquisitions and divestitures - the highest quarterly growth in almost three years. Demand was strong for its Naked cold-pressed fruit and vegetable juices and Lipton teas, the company said.  ""We broadened our beverage portfolio to lessen our reliance on colas..."" Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said, adding that just 12 percent of revenue now comes from Pepsi colas and less than 25 percent from fizzy drinks globally.   Cost of sales fell 6.4 percent as raw material prices declined.

202,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to PepsiCo,  Inc.'s (PepsiCo) EUR750 million 12-year notes offering. The Rating Outlook is  Stable.  Net proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes,  including the repayment of commercial paper (CP). PepsiCo had approximately  $35.6 billion of total debt including $3.6 billion of CP at the end of the  second quarter 2016. The notes will be issued by PepsiCo under the indenture dated May 21, 2007 and  will rank equally with PepsiCo's senior unsecured obligations. Indentures  include covenants for limitations of liens including a carve-out such that the  aggregate amount of secured debt does not exceed 15% of consolidated net  tangible assets and conditions related to consolidation, mergers or sales of  assets. PepsiCo is not bound by any financial covenants. The senior notes are  callable by PepsiCo, subject to a make-whole provision. KEY RATING DRIVERS PepsiCo's ratings reflect its considerable financial flexibility, substantial  cash flow, significant scale, geographic reach, product diversification  including strong margins in its Frito-Lay North America segment, and brand  strength as the world's second largest food and beverage company. Rating  concerns include the company's increased leverage driven by past debt funding  for shareholder initiatives combined with foreign exchange headwinds. However,  Fitch expects net supplemental leverage to remain within the mid 2.5x range  going forward, which Fitch views as acceptable for the current ratings. Brand Strength and Scale Supports 3%-4% Organic Growth More than half of PepsiCo's annual $62 billion in net revenue is derived from  snacks with roughly 60% of PepsiCo's revenue generated in the United States.  PepsiCo's brand strength is demonstrated by its portfolio which consists of more  than 20 brands, including Pepsi, Gatorade, Lay's, Doritos, and Quaker, with more  than $1 billion in annual retail sales and which are typically No. 1 or No. 2 in  their respective categories.  PepsiCo's challenges include global concern with health and wellness trends,  increased excise taxes on its products in certain markets and the maturity of  its categories in developed markets. Additionally, negative sentiment toward  artificial sweeteners has led to past U.S. diet carbonated soft drink (CSD)  volume declines in the upper single digits, although these trends have begun to  moderate. Several of PepsiCo's developed markets have stagnant or declining per  capita CSD consumption trends, weak economies and/or low population growth. Weak  volume trends in developed markets places more dependence on emerging markets,  which have experienced volatility with growth and local cost inflation. PepsiCo  has been able to use price/mix to offset a significant portion of foreign  exchange headwinds, and pricing has remained rational in key developed markets  that enabled PepsiCo to generate core revenue growth of approximately 5% in 2015  and 3% in the first half of 2016. PepsiCo maintains a good breadth of products across its beverage segment with  strong positions in its non-carbonated soft drinks and optimization of price  pack architecture on both smaller pack size and premium/alternative packaging to  drive a higher price per unit. Fitch expects PepsiCo will maintain rationality  and discipline on price to balance declines within its CSD portfolio. CSDs have  become a smaller portion of PepsiCo's overall revenues during the past several  years, comprising less than 25% in 2015.  Operationally, PepsiCo is focused on increasing brand support to grow value  share, expand its emerging market presence, grow its nutrition business, reduce  overhead, and leverage technology and processes across its organization. Thus  Fitch believes PepsiCo's diversified portfolio with strong brands and good  innovation pipeline (9% of sales) should enable core revenue growth of at least  3% to 4% over the next couple of years supported by volume growth in the 2%  range and price/mix growth in the 1% range. Productivity Underpins Stable Cash Generation PepsiCo's five-year $5 billion productivity cost savings program to be completed  by 2019, if fully achieved, should provide the company with significant  financial flexibility to either reinvest into the business and/or increase cash  generation. PepsiCo is using a portion of these savings to bolster brand  strength by increasing media, innovation and R&D spending combined with cost  reductions that should support future growth in revenues and operating profit.  Consequently, Fitch views PepsiCo's long-term mid-single-digit profit before tax  financial targets as achievable.  Despite the effects of foreign exchange translation due to the strong dollar  that has negatively affected EBITDA, benefits of past productivity efforts and  working capital gains have resulted in stable cash generation. Cash flow from  operations (CFFO) and free cash flow (FCF) have averaged $10.3 billion and $3.7  billion respectively for the past three years. Fitch expects PepsiCo's CFFO and  FCF will be within a similar range for 2016.  Overseas Cash Expected to Grow  PepsiCo generates substantial overseas cash flow due to its international  operations. PepsiCo, like other multi-national companies, has been reluctant to  repatriate foreign earnings given the tax consequences. Accordingly, foreign  cash balances have grown along with debt balances to fund domestic cash  requirements for the dividend, U.S. capital investment and share repurchase  program.  In 2014, PepsiCo pursued a return on basis distribution which had negligible tax  consequences and remitted $6 billion of international cash to the United States  to repay CP. Absent a further return on basis distribution or a commitment to  repatriate cash, Fitch anticipates foreign cash levels could grow to the range  of $18 billion to $19 billion by 2017 compared to $11.1 billion at the end of  2015. Supplemental Net Leverage Expected to be Mid-2x  Fitch expects long-term gross debt leverage in 2016 could increase to  approximately 2.8x. Leverage at the end of the first half of 2016 was 2.75x  compared to the low 2x range in 2010. The rise in leverage is due to the  increase in debt balances to fund domestic cash requirements resulting from  increased shareholder returns and translational effects from foreign exchange  headwinds. While PepsiCo has reduced expected shareholder returns to approximately $7  billion in 2016 from $9 billion in 2015, Fitch believes the company could  increase debt by at least $3 billion to fund their domestic cash requirements.  This is based on Fitch's estimate that approximately 45% of CFFO is available  for domestic use and does not consider any foreign cash that could be used for  domestic funding requirements. For U.S. issuers with significant foreign cash balances, Fitch uses a  supplemental adjusted net leverage ratio as part of its analysis. PepsiCo's  supplemental adjusted EBITDA net leverage is expected to increase to  approximately 2.4x for 2016 compared to approximately 2.3x at the end of 2015.  Supplemental adjusted EBITDA net leverage was 2.39x at the end of the first half  2016. Fitch also anticipates PepsiCo's long-term CP balances could rise  materially to support the higher debt borrowings given the reluctance to  repatriate foreign cash. CP balances as of June 11, 2016 were approximately $3.6  billion.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for 2016 for PepsiCo include: --Underlying revenue growth (excluding the additional week and structural  changes)of approximately 3.6% with volume growth in the 2% range and price/mix  growth in the 1% range offset by foreign currency pressure of 4.5% in 2016. In  2017, underlying revenue growth of 3.8%; --$10.4 billion of CFFO with free cash flow (FCF) in excess of $3 billion in  2016. Fitch estimates approximately 45% of CFFO is available for domestic use.  In 2017, Fitch expects CFFO and FCF to rise modestly; --Absent a further return on basis distribution or a commitment to repatriate  cash, Fitch anticipates foreign cash levels could grow to the range of $18  billion to $19 billion by 2017; --Total debt increases by at least $3 billion to fund share repurchases in  2016/2017. This does not consider any foreign cash being used for domestic  funding requirements; --Capital spending in the $3 billion range in 2016/2017;  --Gross leverage of 2.8x and net supplemental leverage of approximately 2.4x. In  2017, gross leverage of approximately 2.9x-3.0x and net supplemental leverage of  approximately 2.4x-2.5x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative action include: --A significant increase in debt due to M&A activity and/or share repurchases  combined with deteriorating operating performance that causes supplemental  adjusted net leverage sustained above the mid 2.5x range; --Gross leverage sustained in excess of 3.0x; --Over reliance on CP to fund domestic cash flow deficits that causes long-term  CP balances to rise materially; --Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a positive  rating action include: --A public commitment by Pepsi to maintain gross leverage in the 2.5x range or  less and supplemental adjusted net leverage as calculated by Fitch below 2x,  while maintaining strong organic growth and operating metrics. Fitch does not  view this as likely given the increased focus on returning cash to shareholders. LIQUIDITY Liquidity, Maturities and Guarantees: PepsiCo maintains good liquidity.  PepsiCo's cash and short-term investments totalled $13.4 billion at the end of  the second quarter 2016, of which $12.6 billion was offshore. This compares to  $7.4 billion at the end of 2014. PepsiCo has a combined capacity of $7.445  billion under its 364-day and five-year revolving credit facilities maturing in  2017 and 2021 respectively that remain undrawn. Upcoming maturities of long-term  debt include approximately $4 billion each in 2017 and 2018.  PepsiCo guarantees all of the senior notes of its bottling subsidiaries:  Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company (PMBC, wholly owned by PepsiCo) and  Bottling Group, LLC (wholly owned by PMBC). While the notes of PMBC and Bottling  Group, LLC are structurally superior to the notes issued by PepsiCo, Inc., Fitch  has chosen not to make a distinction in the ratings at the single 'A' level as  default risk is very low. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS The ratings for PepsiCo and its subsidiaries are as follows: PepsiCo --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A'; --Bank credit facilities at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper program at 'F1'. Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc. (Operating Company/Intermediate  Holding Co.) --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --Guaranteed senior notes at 'A'. Bottling Group, LLC (Operating Company) --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --Guaranteed senior notes at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

213,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to PepsiCo,  Inc.'s (PepsiCo) $4.5 billion multi-tranche offering. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes including the  potential redemption of all or a portion of the 7.90% $1.5 billion senior notes  due Nov. 1, 2018 issued by PepsiCo and the 5.125% $750 million senior notes due  Jan. 15, 2019 issued by Bottling Group, LLC in accordance with the make-whole  redemption provisions. PepsiCo had approximately $35.6 billion of total debt  including $2.9 billion of commercial paper (CP) as of third quarter 2016 (ending  Sept. 3, 2016). The notes will be issued by PepsiCo under the indenture dated May 21, 2007 and  will rank equally with PepsiCo's senior unsecured obligations. Indentures  include covenants for limitations of liens including a carve-out such that the  aggregate amount of secured debt does not exceed 15% of consolidated net  tangible assets and conditions related to consolidation, mergers or sales of  assets. PepsiCo is not bound by any financial covenants. The senior notes are  callable by PepsiCo, subject to a make-whole provision. KEY RATING DRIVERS PepsiCo's ratings reflect its considerable financial flexibility, substantial  cash flow, significant scale, geographic reach, product diversification  including strong margins in its Frito-Lay North America segment, and brand  strength as the world's second largest food and beverage company. Rating  concerns include the increased leverage which has been driven by past debt  funding for shareholder initiatives combined with foreign exchange headwinds.  However, Fitch expects net supplemental leverage to remain within the mid-2.5x  range going forward, which Fitch views as acceptable for current ratings. Brand Strength and Scale Supports 3%-4% Organic Growth More than half of PepsiCo's annual $62 billion in net revenue is derived from  snacks with roughly 60% of revenue generated in the United States. PepsiCo's  brand strength is demonstrated by its portfolio which consists of more than 20  brands, including Pepsi, Gatorade, Lay's, Doritos, and Quaker, with more than $1  billion in annual retail sales, which are typically No. 1 or No. 2 in their  respective categories.  PepsiCo's challenges include global concern with health and wellness trends,  increased excise taxes on its products in certain markets and the maturity of  its categories in developed markets. In addition, negative sentiment toward  artificial sweeteners have led to past U.S. diet carbonated soft drink (CSD)  volume declines in the upper single digits although these trends have begun to  moderate. Several of PepsiCo's developed markets have stagnant or declining per  capita CSD consumption trends, weak economies and/or low population growth. Weak  volume trends in developed markets places more dependence on emerging markets  which have experienced volatility with growth and local cost inflation. PepsiCo  has been able to use price/mix to offset a significant portion of foreign  exchange headwinds and pricing has remained rational in key developed markets  which enabled PepsiCo to generate core revenue growth of approximately 5% in  2015 and approximately 4% during the first three quarters of 2016. PepsiCo maintains a good breadth of products across its beverage segment with  strong positions in its non-carbonated soft drinks and optimization of  price-pack architecture on both smaller pack size and premium/alternative  packaging to drive a higher price per unit. Fitch expects PepsiCo will maintain  rationality and discipline on price in order to balance declines within its CSD  portfolio. CSDs have become a smaller portion of PepsiCo's overall revenues  during the past several years, comprising less than 25% in 2015. Operationally, PepsiCo is focused on increasing brand support to grow value  share, expand its emerging market presence, grow its nutrition business, reduce  overhead, and leverage technology and processes across its organization. Thus  Fitch believes PepsiCo's diversified portfolio with strong brands and good  innovation pipeline (approximately 9% of sales) should enable core revenue  growth of at least 3% to 4% over the next couple of years supported by volume  growth in the 2% range and price/mix growth in the approximate 2% range. Productivity Underpins Stable Cash Generation PepsiCo's five-year $5 billion productivity cost savings program to be completed  by 2019, if fully achieved, should provide the company with significant  financial flexibility to either reinvest into the business and/or increase cash  generation. PepsiCo is using a portion of these savings to bolster brand  strength by increasing media, innovation and R&D spending combined with cost  reductions that should support future growth in revenues and operating profit.  Consequently, Fitch views PepsiCo's long-term mid-single-digit profit before-tax  financial targets as achievable.  Despite the effects of foreign exchange translation from the strong dollar that  has negatively affected EBITDA, benefits of past productivity efforts and  working capital gains have resulted in stable cash generation. Cash flow from  operations (CFFO) and free cash flow (FCF) have averaged $10.3 billion and $3.7  billion, respectively, for the past three years. Fitch expects PepsiCo's CFFO  and FCF will be within a similar range for 2016.  Overseas Cash Expected to Grow  PepsiCo generates substantial overseas cash flow due to its international  operations. PepsiCo, like other multi-national companies, has been reluctant to  repatriate foreign earnings given the tax consequences. Accordingly, foreign  cash balances have grown along with debt balances to fund domestic cash  requirements for the dividend, U.S. capital investment and share repurchase  program.  In 2014, PepsiCo pursued a return-on-basis distribution which had negligible tax  consequences and remitted $6 billion of international cash to the U.S. to repay  CP. Absent a further return-on-basis distribution or a commitment to repatriate  cash, Fitch anticipates foreign cash levels could grow to the range of $18  billion to $19 billion by 2017 compared to $11.1 billion at the end of 2015. Supplemental Net Leverage Expected to Be Mid-2x  Fitch expects long-term gross debt leverage in 2016 could increase to  approximately 2.8x. Leverage at the end of 3Q16 was 2.7x, which compares to the  low-2x range in 2010. The rise in leverage is due to the increase in debt  balances to fund domestic cash requirements resulting from increased shareholder  returns and translational effects from foreign exchange headwinds. For 2016, while PepsiCo has reduced expected shareholder returns to  approximately $7 billion from $9 billion in 2015, Fitch believes PepsiCo could  increase debt by at least $3 billion to fund their domestic cash requirements.  This is based on Fitch's estimate that approximately 45% of CFFO is available  for domestic use, and does not consider any foreign cash that could be used for  domestic funding requirements. Debt increased $2.3 billion during the first  three quarters of 2016. For U.S. issuers with significant foreign cash balances, Fitch uses a  supplemental adjusted net leverage ratio as part of our analysis. PepsiCo's  supplemental adjusted EBITDA net leverage is expected to increase to  approximately 2.4x for 2016 compared to approximately 2.3x at the end of 2015  (this figure was 2.4x at the end of 3Q16).  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for 2016 for PepsiCo include: -- Underlying revenue growth (excluding the additional week and structural  changes) of approximately 3.6% with volume growth in the 2% range and price/mix  growth in the 1.5% range offset by foreign currency pressure of 3.5% in 2016. In  2017, underlying revenue growth of 3.8%; -- $10.4 billion of CFFO with free cash flow (FCF) in excess of $3 billion in  2016. Fitch estimates approximately 45% of CFFO is available for domestic use.  In 2017, Fitch expects CFFO and FCF to rise modestly; -- Absent a further return-on-basis distribution or a commitment to repatriate  cash, Fitch anticipates foreign cash levels could grow to the range of $18  billion to $19 billion by 2017; -- Total debt increases by at least $3 billion to fund share repurchases in  2016/2017. This does not consider any foreign cash being used for domestic  funding requirements; -- Capital spending in the $3 billion range in 2016/2017;  -- Gross leverage of 2.8x and net supplemental leverage of approximately 2.4x.  In 2017, gross leverage of approximately 2.9x-3.0x and net supplemental leverage  of approximately 2.4x-2.5x. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative action include: --A significant increase in debt due to M&A activity and/or share repurchases  combined with deteriorating operating performance that leads to supplemental  adjusted net leverage sustained above the mid-2.5x range; --Gross leverage sustained in excess of 3.0x; --Over-reliance on CP to fund domestic cash flow deficits that causes long-term  CP balances to rise materially. -- Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  positive rating action include: --A public commitment by Pepsi to maintain gross leverage in the 2.5x range or  less and supplemental adjusted net leverage as calculated by Fitch below 2x,  while maintaining strong organic growth and operating metrics. Fitch does not  view this as likely given the increased focus on returning cash to shareholders. LIQUIDITY Liquidity, Maturities and Guarantees: PepsiCo maintains good liquidity.  PepsiCo's cash and short-term investments totalled $14.8 billion at the end of  3Q16, of which $14.0 billion was offshore. This compares to $11.1 billion at the  end of 2015. PepsiCo has a combined capacity of $7.445 billion under its 364-day  and five-year revolving credit facilities maturing in 2017 and 2021,  respectively, that remain undrawn. Upcoming maturities of long-term debt include  approximately $4 billion each in 2017 and 2018.  PepsiCo guarantees all of the senior notes of its bottling subsidiaries -  Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company (PMBC), which is wholly owned by  PepsiCo, and Bottling Group, LLC (wholly owned by PMBC). While the notes of PMBC  and Bottling Group, LLC are structurally superior to the notes issued by  PepsiCo, Inc., Fitch has chosen not to make a distinction in the ratings at the  single 'A' level as default risk is very low. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch rates PepsiCo and its subsidiaries as follows: PepsiCo --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A'; --Bank credit facilities 'A'; --Short-Term IDR 'F1'; --Commercial paper program 'F1'. Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc. (Operating Company/Intermediate  Holding Co.) --Long-Term IDR 'A'; --Guaranteed senior notes 'A'. Bottling Group, LLC (Operating Company) --Long-Term IDR 'A'; --Guaranteed senior notes 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  Summary of Financial Statement Adjustments - Financial statement adjustments  that depart materially from those contained in the published financial  statements of the relevant rated entity or obligor are disclosed below: --Historical and projected EBITDA is adjusted to add back non-cash stock-based  compensation expense and restructuring as reported in financials.  --Supplemental adjusted net leverage ratio is determined by reducing foreign  cash balances by applying a generic 35% tax haircut and a further 50% adjustment  capturing expectations for additional foreign cash balances that could be used  for shareholder-friendly actions to accommodate PepsiCo's relatively aggressive  policy for share buybacks.

In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided ""as is"" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein.

Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent).

215,"   By Martinne Geller | LONDON  LONDON PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) has set a target for reducing the amount of sugar in its soft drinks around the world as part of a suite of goals aimed at tackling problems ranging from obesity to climate change. The New York-based company will announce on Monday that by 2025 at least two thirds of its drinks will have 100 calories or fewer from added sugar per 12 oz serving, up from about 40 percent now. The move, which it plans to achieve by introducing more zero and low-calorie drinks and reformulating existing drinks, comes as PepsiCo and rival Coca-Cola (KO.N) come under increasing pressure from health experts and governments who blame them for fuelling epidemics of obesity and diabetes. PepsiCo says the new global target is more ambitious than its previous goal of reducing sugar by 25 percent in certain drinks in certain markets by 2020.     ""The science has evolved,"" Mehmood Khan, PepsiCo's chief scientific officer of research and development, told Reuters. He gave an example of new flavor ingredients that require less sweetening, saying: ""It's not just about sweeteners, it's about understanding the flavor ingredients and having proprietary knowledge and access to them."" The World Health Organization this month recommended taxes on sugary drinks, as France and Mexico have done, to curb consumption and improve health. The soft drinks industry opposes such taxes. Despite its name, PepsiCo generates only 12 percent of its $63 billion in annual revenue from its famous cola brand. It makes 25 percent from carbonated soft drinks such as Mountain Dew, with the rest coming from waters and juices including the Tropicana brand, plus snacks and dips such as hummus and guacamole.Its 2025 goals also include targets for lowering sodium and saturated fat.FINANCIAL PROGRESS  ""These are good steps. But when we have an obesity crisis, I think there is more that we can be doing,"" said Mindy Lubber, president of non-profit organization Ceres, which pushes companies and investors to take action on sustainability.""If a food and beverage company is not looking at nutrition, they are not looking at the direction the world is going in.""Coke has said that by 2020 it would offer low-calorie or no-calorie options in every market as part of its sustainability goals.PepsiCo is building on goals set out 10 years ago, which targeted nutritional, environmental and social improvements. Khan said there has also been financial progress.  He said the company has saved $600 million over the past five years from reduced water, packaging and energy use, as well as a reduction in waste. He added that, over the past decade, average returns on investments in this area have been better than the cost of capital. Khan expects similar returns in future, which might be good news for investors, who generally don't base investment decisions on sustainability.""It might not be the driving factor, but it might a filter,"" said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.  Other targets include a 15 percent improvement in the water efficiency of PepsiCo's direct agricultural supply chain in water-stressed areas by 2025 and a 20 percent drop in greenhouse gas emissions across its supply chain by 2030.

218,"  Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (DPS.N) and PepsiCo (PEP.N) on Tuesday both announced plans to buy alternative drinks makers, the latest examples of beverage companies branching into products perceived as healthier as soda sales decline. Dr Pepper Snapple, which makes flavored tea, juice drinks, 7UP and Schweppes sodas, will buy antioxidant beverages maker Bai Brands LLC for $1.7 billion in cash, the companies said in a joint statement. Dr Pepper Snapple, which is based in Plano, Texas, already has a roughly 3 percent stake in Bai and a distribution deal with the Hamilton, New Jersey-based company. Pepsi, based in Purchase, New York, said it will buy probiotic drinks maker KeVita Inc for an undisclosed amount. Reuters reported last month the soda maker was nearing a deal for Oxnard, California-based KeVita, estimated under $500 million.The moves signify a further push by beverage companies into more premium products amid a challenging business environment. Carbonated beverage demand hit a 30-year low in the United States last year, according to Beverage Digest. Officials globally are considering sugary drinks taxes to try to stem obesity and diabetes epidemics. This month alone, five U.S. regions approved such levies. ""This is a continued play on health and wellness. The noncarbonated beverage space continues to grow at the expense of the carbonated sodas that Pepsi and Dr Pepper are known for,"" said Adam Fleck of Morningstar in Chicago. Dr Pepper Snapple shares jumped 2.6 percent, and Pepsi shares were up 0.6 percent.Bai, which means ""pure"" in Mandarin Chinese, makes carbonated flavored water, coconut water and premium ready-to-drink teas. KeVita makes kombucha, which is fermented tea, and other drinks that are certified organic, gluten-free and vegan. Soda giants have built stakes and bought beverage companies to cater to changing tastes. Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) bought organic bottled-tea maker Honest Tea and Zico Coconut Water and invested in organic juice maker Suja.The Bai deal is Dr Pepper Snapple's first major acquisition since it was spun out of Cadbury Schweppes in 2008. It is a ""defensive"" move by Dr Pepper Snapple to keep a strategic relationship with Bai, said Morningstar's Fleck. The company has lost key distribution deals with companies in the past including Vitaminwater, which was sold to Coca-Cola in 2007.Dr Pepper Snapple, which Reuters reported in October was in talks to buy Bai, said Bai would add $132 million to net sales in 2017. The company said the acquisition is expected to hurt earnings by 3 cents per share in 2017, but will add to profits in 2018. The purchase price includes a tax benefit of about $400 million on a net present value basis.
