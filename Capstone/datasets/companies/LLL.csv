0,"   By Sagarika Jaisinghani, Sweta Singh and Alwyn Scott  An employee complaint exposed accounting misconduct at L-3 Communications Holdings Inc, according to people familiar with the matter, prompting the aerospace and defense supplier to fire four people, revise two years of earnings statements and cut its earnings forecast.L-3's shares plunged as much as 17 percent - their biggest intraday percentage drop ever - after the company said on Thursday it would take a pretax charge of $84 million for misconduct and accounting errors, including cost overruns and overstated sales figures from 2013 and 2014.    The surprise announcement prompted some analysts to cut ratings on the company, and raised concern about a broader problem at L-3, which also suffered an ethics scandal in 2010.The sources said the latest misconduct stemmed from a single fixed-price contract for maintenance and logistics support with the U.S. military that began in December 2010 and runs through January 2015. The Pentagon has not barred L-3 from bidding on other contacts as a result of the misconduct, the sources added.The pretax charge includes adjustments for accounting errors L-3 found as it scrubbed its books during the review, said the sources, who spoke on condition that they not be named.""The profit L-3 expected in the contract just wasn't there,"" said one of the sources.The sources declined to say which branch of the military had the contract, or precisely which part of L-3 was involved, other than that it was in its aerospace unit. They also would not say how recently the employee lodged the complaint.However, they said the New York-based company quickly fired four employees and hired law firm Simpson Thatcher to conduct the investigation and consulting firm AlixPartners to perform forensic accounting. ""We had some bad actors and they are no longer part of L-3,"" Chief Executive Michael Strianese said on a conference call with analysts.Another employee resigned in connection with the review.  The whistleblower is still with the company, and the review is continuing, but not expected to turn up significant additional charges, the sources said.L-3, founded in 1997 and built through mergers and acquisitions of smaller companies, supplies a wide range of military and civil electronics equipment and services, including aircraft ""black boxes,"" communications transponders and cockpit display panels. The accounting errors surprised investors, but they stopped short of triggering a ""restatement"" of L-3's accounting. Instead, the financial statements are being ""revised"" to reflect what are considered non-material adjustments, and the statements can still be relied on by investors, the sources said. L-3 also reported on Thursday preliminary sales of $3.02 billion for the second quarter ended June 27, but said the figure could be revised lower after the review is finished.The company cut its full-year earnings forecast by 30 cents a share, to $7.90-$8.10 per share from $8.20-$8.40, reflecting expected charges in the second half related to the review.Analysts peppered Strianese and CFO Ralph D'Ambrosio with questions on the conference call about whether other misconduct could appear elsewhere.""We have no reason to believe that this issue occurred at any other segment of the company,"" Strianese said.    Accounting irregularities tend to unnerve investors and bring further scrutiny of company's operations, analyst said. The incident raised memories of a 2010 event in which an L-3 unit was suspended from doing contract work for the U.S. Air Force for allegedly using a government computer to gather business information for its own use.  Strianese said that case found no evidence that anyone at L-3 ""did anything wrong"" and ""actually proved that we did not have any bad actors.""Still, ""situations involving accounting misconduct with government contractors do not end quickly and generally are expanded in scope,"" said CRT Capital analyst Brian Ruttenbur, who cut his rating on L-3 stock to ""sell"" from ""fair value.""D'Ambrosio said the contract involved in the review had average annual sales of about $150 million.""It's a low-margin contract and with these adjustments, it is now in a loss position,"" he said.L-3 said about $50 million of the $84 million charge related to periods prior to 2014 and about $30 million related to the second quarter of 2014.The company's shares were down 16.3 percent at $103.33 in afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

The United States alleged that from 2006 through November 2011, L-3 knowingly overcharged the government for time the company's independent contractors spent at pre-deployment centers in Fort Benning, Georgia, and Fort Bliss, Texas, where people headed overseas get orientation briefings, training, health screenings, payroll processing and deal with other administrative matters.

13,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK L-3 Communications Holdings Inc agreed to pay $25.6 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the military contractor of defrauding the U.S. government by selling thousands of holographic weapon sights that it knew were defective.Tuesday's settlement resolves civil claims that L-3 and its EOTech unit violated the federal False Claims Act by concealing defects that caused the sights to fail in extreme cold or humidity, including one defect that was hidden for 8-1/2 years.Also known as combat optical sights, the sights are mounted on weapons and used by special operations forces and law enforcement to target and accurately return fire in extreme environmental conditions, according to papers filed by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan federal court.Bharara said New York-based L-3 hid the defects from the Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and FBI, even as it sold them tens of millions of dollars of the sights beginning in 2004. He also said L-3 touted the military's use of its products to improve its image and boost commercial sales. In a statement, L-3 said it cooperated fully with the government and is pleased to settle. The company previously set aside money for the accord, which requires court approval.Bharara's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

14,"   By Jonathan Stempel  L-3 Communications Holdings Inc was sued on Tuesday by the U.S. government, which accused the military contractor of fraudulently selling it thousands of holographic weapon sights that it knew were defective.The sights, also known as combat optical sights, are mounted on weapons and used by special operations forces and law enforcement to target and accurately return fire in extreme environmental conditions.Shares of L-3 fell as much as 6.1 percent after the lawsuit filed by U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in Manhattan federal court became public, but later pared those losses. According to the complaint, L-3 and its EOTech unit for years concealed defects that caused the sights to fail in cold or humid environments, even as they touted the U.S. military's use of their products to boost sales. The government said EOTech has been paid tens of millions of dollars since 2004 to provide the sights to the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI.Tuesday's lawsuit seeks civil penalties and triple damages for alleged violations of the federal False Claims Act, as well as to recoup sums paid for the defective sights. L-3 did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In a regulatory filing this month, the company said it had set aside $26 million for a possible settlement related to holographic weapon sights.In afternoon trading, L-3 shares were down 2.4 percent at $123.07, after earlier falling as low as $118.30.",2015-11-24,LLL,"Tue Nov 24, 2015 | 12:57pm EST",U.S. files civil fraud lawsuit against defense firm L-3 Communications,http://www.reuters.com//article/l-3-communi-hldg-lawsuit-idUSL1N13J1RL20151124?type=companyNews
15,"   By Mike Stone and Greg Roumeliotis  L-3 Communications Holdings Inc (LLL.N) is in exclusive talks to sell National Security Solutions (NSS), its government services division, to smaller defense contractor CACI International Inc (CACI.N) for around $550 million, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.If it strikes a deal, L-3 would be the latest military technology company to shed its less-profitable government consultancy operations in response to lower U.S. military spending.A deal would help L-3, the Pentagon's No. 7 prime contractor last year, as it looks to move away from low-margin businesses and focus on the communications and defense electronics markets. A deal could be announced as early as next week, assuming negotiations are concluded successfully, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. L-3 declined comment. CACI did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Shares of L-3 closed up 2.7 percent on Friday at $124.01, while CACI shares rose 1.2 percent to $101.64. NSS sells a wide range of services to businesses, government and intelligence agencies. Recently, NSS was awarded a contract to provide comprehensive training to Royal Saudi Air Force operations personnel. Based in Arlington, Virginia, CACI sells information services to national security agencies, the military, and other government departments. It has a market value of about $2.4 billion.Chris Kubasik, who was previously a president and chief operating officer of Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), joined L-3 as president and chief operating officer in late October.A successful divestiture of the NSS business would buck a trend of failed sales of similar units, such as BAE Systems Plc's (BAES.L) attempt to sell its services unit, which was called off after a long effort. Other large defense contractors have also soured on the struggling government services sector. Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, said earlier this year that it plans to sell or spin off information technology and services businesses that generate $6 billion in annual revenue. CACI is vying for the Lockheed assets and has discussed a so-called Reverse Morris Trust deal, which would avoid a heavy tax bill, sources familiar with the matter said earlier this week.

21,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK, March 31  NEW YORK, March 31 A federal judge rejected L-3 Communications Holdings Inc's bid to dismiss a lawsuit by shareholders seeking to recoup losses stemming from the defense contractor's alleged accounting fraud in its aerospace systems business.In a Wednesday night decision, U.S. District Judge Valerie Caproni in Manhattan said shareholders led by two Michigan pension plans can pursue claims that L-3 hid improprieties tied to a contract to service U.S. Army C-12 airplanes, including those raised by an internal management-level whistleblower.The judge also dismissed related claims against Chief Executive Michael Strianese and Chief Financial Officer Ralph D'Ambrosio, finding a lack of evidence that they acted recklessly or intended to defraud. L-3 shares slid 12.3 percent on July 31, 2014, wiping out roughly $1.3 billion of market value, after the New York-based company said it would restate two years of results, take a charge against earnings, and fire four people over problems with the C-12 contract, including cost overruns and inflated sales.Caproni said the firings, including of the aerospace systems unit's CFO, for what Strianese called ""misconduct"" gave rise to a ""strong inference"" that L-3 intended to defraud shareholders. She also said L-3's alleged misstatements could be material. The judge did not rule on the merits of the lawsuit, which seeks class-action status.Neither L-3 nor lawyers for the company and its executives, immediately responded on Thursday to requests for comment. The plaintiffs were led by the City of Pontiac General Employees' Retirement System, Local 1205 Pension Plan, and the City of Taylor Police and Fire Retirement System.David Rosenfeld, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said his clients are pleased that the case against L-3 can go forward.The cases in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, have different named plaintiffs. They are Patel v. L-3 Communications Holdings Inc et al, No. 14-06038; Nguyen v. L-3 Communications Holdings Inc et al, No. 14-06182; and Valentino v.
