""In general, the upswing in Europe is slow - it will not be financed very much by borrowing,"" CEO Christian Clausen said. ""We are adjusting to that, so we are taking out activity-related costs.""Clausen said consumers were starting to spend more, but that they were not borrowing more. Companies, he said, remained cautious on investments and employment.Nordea said it now aims to create 900 million euros in cost savings from 2013 to 2015, up from a previous 450 million euros.Nick Anderson, an analyst at Berenberg bank, said the plan looked aggressive. ""They have a very good track record of delivering, so delivery I wouldn't doubt. The interesting question to pose is: Will this impact revenues?"" he said.Credit Suisse said in a note that the bank's plan to lower its cost base by five percent by 2015 looked credible, saying it implied a 4-6 percent upgrade to earnings forecasts for 2015.Shares in Nordea fell 0.9 percent by 1152 GMT, underperforming a modestly higher blue-chip Stockholm index .Nordea's earnings follow weaker-than-expected results from Swedish rival Swedbank on Tuesday.  Handelsbanken and SEB report next week. Nordic banks have been busy strengthening their balance sheets, pulling out of riskier areas such as Poland and Russia in order to focus on core markets, and have benefited from far lower funding costs relative to peers.Strong public finances in Sweden - with a top-notch AAA investment rating - have made them especially attractive to investors seeking shelter as the debt crisis played out in Europe.Still, many investors who had hoped the well-capitalised banks would start returning more capital through special dividends, share buybacks or higher payout ratios may have to wait a bit longer.Regulatory uncertainty remains a concern, so banks are keen to retain high capital buffers as they wait on authorities to decide on countercyclical capital buffers and possibly higher risk weights for mortgages.Nordea laid the ground for higher dividends this year and next, but said the impact of tougher regulatory requirements was too uncertain for it to decide on its long-term target for returning capital to shareholders.It proposed a dividend of 0.43 euros per share for the year, up 26 percent from a year ago but just missing analyst forecasts.Nordea's operating profit for the fourth quarter was 1.01 billion euros ($1.38 billion) compared with a mean forecast for 1.10 billion seen in a Reuters poll of analysts and a year-ago 1.03 billion.

5,"  By Susan KellyFeb 4 Boston Scientific Corp on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected quarterly results, citing improving demand for its devices that manage irregular heart rhythms.But U.S. sales of implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), which shock dangerously fast heartbeats back to normal, were flat. Some analysts were looking for stronger sales of the important product after competitor St. Jude Medical Inc  reported positive sales growth last month.""There were some fits and starts in the quarter,"" said Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy. ""The U.S. ICD business was particularly light.""Investors have anticipated a recovery in the market for heart rhythm products after several years of declining sales. The U.S. economic downturn had reduced demand for healthcare, and medical studies suggested the devices have been overused. Boston Scientific is also expected to benefit from the introduction of its S-ICD system. The ""lead wires"" in this new type of implantable defibrillator are threaded up the sternum rather than attached to the heart.Boston Scientific last year began to see growth in revenue, which had been falling for years, after the company embarked on a turnaround strategy involving cost cuts and restructuring efforts.In the fourth quarter, Boston Scientific's profit rose to $108 million, or 8 cents a share, from $60 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding acquisition, divestiture, litigation and restructuring charges, earnings were 21 cents a share. Analysts on average had expected 13 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sales rose 1 percent to $1.84 billion, while analysts had forecast $1.83 billion.Worldwide sales of cardiac rhythm management products, including pacemakers and ICDs, climbed 2 percent to $468 million in the fourth quarter. Sales of interventional cardiology products, primarily stents that are inserted into clogged heart arteries to help prop them open, fell 6 percent to $500 million.Boston Scientific forecast 2014 earnings of 75 cents to 80 cents a share, excluding special items, on revenue of $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion.Analysts on average were expecting a profit of 52 cents a share on revenue of $7.41 billion.Shares of Boston Scientific more than doubled last year on anticipation of a recovery in the heart rhythm device market and enthusiasm about the company's product pipeline.The stock was down 0.3 percent at $12.97 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.",2014-02-04,STJ,"Tue Feb 4, 2014 | 12:02pm EST",UPDATE 2-Boston Scientific profit up as heart device demand improves,http://www.reuters.com//article/bostonscientific-results-idUSL2N0L90J020140204?type=companyNews,0.9803,0.042,0.842,0.116

9,"  May 28 St. Jude Medical Inc said on Wednesday it plans to exercise its option to buy the shares of CardioMEMS it does not already own for $375 million following news the Food and Drug Administration has approved CardioMEMS's wireless heart device.The implantable device is designed for use in managing patients with heart failure. It records pulmonary artery pressure and transmits it to physicians, who can monitor it remotely and manage the condition.""FDA approval is in line with our expectation and a positive for St. Jude,"" Larry Biegelsen, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, said in a research note. He estimates CardioMEMS sales will reach $259 million annually by 2018.In September 2010, St. Jude paid $60 million for a 19 percent stake in CardioMEMS, with an exclusive option to buy the remaining 81 percent for $375 million. The company said it plans to exercise its option and expects to complete the acquisition in the second quarter of this year.

He added the CardioMEMS system ""has the chance to be one of the more meaningful technological advances in heart failure management in recent memory."" Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump enough blood through the body to meet its demands, pushing up blood pressure in the heart. Increased pulmonary artery pressure can precede worsening heart failure.

10,"  (Rewrites with analyst, fund manager comment on potential future deals)By Susan Kelly and Bill BerkrotJune 16 Medtronic Inc's $43 billion deal for Dublin-based Covidien Plc should accelerate already intense efforts by medical device rivals to seek merger partners, industry analysts and bankers said on Monday.Medtronic announced the transaction on Sunday, saying it would re-base the combined company in Ireland, where it can take advantage of lower corporate tax rates and easier access to cash generated overseas.The purchase also gives Medtronic more products, as well as  greater leverage in negotiating with hospital clients that are taking a much harder line on device spending.The intensified competition will bring new pressure on large device makers such as Abbott Laboratories, Stryker Corp  and St Jude Medical Inc to seek acquisitions, industry watchers say. Medtronic plus Covidien will rival industry leader Johnson & Johnson's $28.5 billion in annual device revenue.UK-based Smith & Nephew Plc, which has already attracted takeover interest from companies seeking better tax rates overseas, remains high on the list of targets, they said. Device makers such as  Boston Scientific Corp should feel more pressure to get bigger or face being left out in the cold.The merger mania is a product of pressures on the healthcare systems in the United States and in Europe, where hospitals are getting paid less to deliver care. U.S. hospital systems are consolidating and buying doctor practices to cope with the changes.""It becomes more necessary for the medical device companies to have a broader product line in order to be able compete and have economies of scale,"" said Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the San Francisco-based healthcare fund StockDoc Partners. Medtronic said its own appetite for deals does not end with absorbing Covidien. It expects to use some of the additional cash flow from the deal on acquisitions and minority investments, and internal research and development.""There still are plenty of opportunities for us to focus on other acquisitions, other innovation. That momentum doesn't need to stop, even in this integration period,"" Medtronic Chief Financial Officer Gary Ellis said in a conference call with analysts.Medtronic has been especially eager to expand beyond selling devices to providing advisory services to hospitals.""To the degree we can bring in other acquisitions to support that further, we will look closely at that,"" Chief Executive Omar Ishrak said. EMULATING MEDTRONIC The latest consolidation wave in the medical device arena began in April when Zimmer Holdings Inc reached a deal to buy rival Biomet Inc for more than $13 billion, expanding its orthopedic product offerings.Rival orthopedics maker St Jude Medical ""could be an acquirer of a smaller company to emulate what Medtronic is doing,"" Yaffe said. Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang has Stryker atop her list of potential acquirers.""That company is a serial acquirer and CEO Kevin Lobo has indicated that it is trying to move the company in the direction of becoming a larger partner with its hospital customers, the same strategy that Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic are taking to heart,"" Wang said.Wang sees Edwards Lifesciences Corp as a target whose specialty in heart valves would fit in with a number of companies interested in cardiac products.Yaffe listed Hospira Inc, Becton Dickson and Co     , Baxter International Inc and Massimo Corp  as attractive takeover candidates that could help a larger company become more of a one-stop shop for hospitals.While several industry experts pointed to Boston Scientific as an acquirer, it could still be wary in the wake of its $27 billion purchase of Guidant in 2006. The deal left it heavily in debt and struggling with a depressed stock price for years.Medtronic is acquiring Covidien in a so-called inversion transaction that allows it to reincorporate in Ireland.Analysts said the strategy will give Medtronic access to cash generated through sales outside the United States and now held overseas without paying a penalty for repatriating the money. This benefit overshadows the modest reduction in the overall corporate tax rate that the company is forecasting.Medtronic also said Monday it would maintain its prior forecast for fiscal 2015 earnings in the range of $4 to $4.10 a share. Its shares were off 1.4 percent at $59.87, while those of Covidien were up 20.7 percent at $86.93.

Violations included a failure to validate testing methods. Implantable heart defibrillators are small devices that are placed in the chest to correct irregular heart beat. Durata and Riata leads are wires that connect this device to the heart.St. Jude first recalled Riata wires in 2011 after finding the insulation on them wore away prematurely. Last year, regulators questioned the design process for Durata leads. The company has also been losing market share to competitors Medtronic Inc and Boston Scientific Inc in selling implantable defibrillators due to lingering concerns about problems with its lead wires. St. Jude sells pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, artificial heart valves, stents and neurological products.The company's shares were little changed at $69.70 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.

19,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed St. Jude Medical, Inc.'s  (STJ) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A' with a Stable Rating Outlook. Fitch has  also affirmed the company's short-term IDR at 'F1'. A full list of Fitch's  rating actions is available at the end of this release. The ratings apply to approximately $4.21 billion of debt outstanding as of June  28, 2014. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's rating actions reflect the following: --Fitch expects leverage (total debt/EBITDA) of 2.4 times (x) at June 28, 2014  to decline to 1.4x-1.5x during the next 12 - 18 months. --The stabilizing domestic cardiac rhythm management (CRM) market, new product  introductions and emerging market strength support an expectation of low- to  mid-single-digit revenue growth during 2014 and 2015. --Fitch believes STJ's focus on cost control and improving its sales mix will  partially offset the negative effect that pricing and excise taxes will have on  margins.  --Moderate sales growth and modestly pressured margins should drive 2014 free  cash flow (FCF) of $750 million to $850 million. --Fitch expects STJ will balance acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends  with a credit profile supportive of an 'A' rating. --STJ is anticipated to maintain adequate liquidity through cash balances,  reliably positive FCF and ready access to the credit markets. HIGH LEVERAGE TO DECLINE Fitch expects STJ will decrease leverage to 1.4x-1.5x during the next 12 - 18  months through increased EBITDA and meaningful debt reduction. Continued  improving operational performance should provide for EBITDA growth as well as  increased cash generation. Current leverage of approximately 2.4x is largely the  result of acquisitions and to a lesser extent share repurchases. REVENUE GROWTH EXPECTED IN ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS Fitch expects STJ to generate low- to mid-single-digit revenue growth during the  next 12-24 months. New product introductions, expansion into faster growing  product- and geographic markets, stabilization of the cardiac rhythm market and  two favorable facilities re-inspections by the FDA should more than offset the  negative effect of a weak domestic economic environment and the relatively  austere European markets. STJ has recently launched, or expects to launch in the near term, devices in all  four of its business segments [Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM), Atrial  Fibrillation (AF), Cardiovascular (CV) and Neuromodulation (NM)]. A number of  these are differentiated by their clinical effectiveness and safety profiles, as  well as by the ability to reduce medical costs compared to competing devices.  Fitch believes the company's new product development and commercialization  efforts will continue to support favorable pricing and potentially incremental  market share gains. While markets outside of the three developed markets of U.S., Europe and Japan  account for only 16% of total firm sales in 2013, their contribution has  increased from roughly 13% in 2011. STJ's annual growth rate in the three  developed markets from 2011 to 2013 was a negative 2%, compared to a growth rate  of 6% for its other markets. Fitch expects positive growth rates to return to  the developed markets; however, growth in the other markets will likely continue  to outperform the developed markets.  CRM demand has somewhat stabilized despite a continued a weak employment  environment, and STJ's recently introduced quadripolar leads have enabled the  company to capture share. The negative effect on volumes from a January 2011  Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) article suggesting the  implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are overused has likely run its  course. MARGIN HEADWINDS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COST CONTROL AND MIX Fitch forecasts incrementally stressed margins for STJ, given a number of  persistent headwinds. While STJ margins have remained relatively strong, owing  to mix shift to newer, higher margin devices and its ongoing focus on cost  control, a more challenging hospital reimbursement environment and the ACA  excise tax should modestly offset the supporting trends. Longer term, Fitch  expects that the company will incrementally improve its margins through  continued gains in efficiency and favorable mix shifts (product and geographic).  RELIABLE FCF Fitch believes that increasing revenue with modestly pressured margins will  result in STJ generating $750 million - $850 million of annual FCF (cash flow  from operations minus capital expenditures of roughly $230 million and dividends  of roughly $300 million) during the next two years. Cash generation should be  sufficient to fund targeted acquisitions and moderate share repurchases.  TARGETED ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES LIKELY Fitch believes that STJ will remain acquisitive, focusing on companies or device  platforms that offer innovation and growth, as technological advancement in the  device sector is still relatively fragmented. Share repurchases will likely  continue, especially in the absence of viable acquisition targets. The company's  recently instituted cash dividend may moderate the level of share repurchases.  Fitch expects STJ will balance its transactions within the context of  maintaining a credit profile supportive of its 'A' ratings. PLANO AND SYLMAR FACILITIES APPROVED TO PRODUCE NEW DEVICES STJ has allayed concerns regarding device production  for its CRM and NM business. During the past few months, the company has  resolved the manufacturing issues that have slowed new product approvals at two  of its facilities in Sylmar, CA and Plano, TX. The FDA has greenlighted both  facilities to produce new devices following recent re-inspections. The Sylmar  facility manufactures CRM devices, such as Durata and Optim, while the Plano  facility makes NM devices. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY ANTICIPATED At June 28, 2014, STJ had adequate liquidity, comprised of approximately $1.58  billion in cash plus short-term marketable securities and roughly $114 million  (net of $1,336 million commercial paper borrowings) in availability on its $1.5  billion bank revolving credit facility, which expires in May 2018. STJ generated  approximately $641 million in FCF (net of $196 million of capital expenditures  and $292 million of dividends) during latest 12 months (LTM), ended June 30,  2014.  The company had approximately $4.2 billion in debt with (excluding $1,336  million in commercial paper outstanding) approximately $64 million maturing in  2014, $500 million in 2015, $500 million in 2016 and $1,805 million thereafter.  Fitch expects the vast majority of STJ's maturities will be refinanced with its  ample access to credit markets. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: --Fitch does not anticipate an upgrade in the near to intermediate term.  --However, STJ would need to commit to and operate with leverage stronger than  1.3x-1.4x while maintaining relatively stable operations and solid FCF, in order  for Fitch to consider a positive rating action. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following: --Debt sustained above 1.6x-1.7x EBITDA without the prospect for timely  deleveraging.  --This could result from a scenario in which revenue and margins are  significantly stressed (more than Fitch anticipates); resulting FCF weakens; and  capital deployment not being adjusted to reduce the company's need for debt  financing.  --As such, significant debt-financed share repurchases or acquisitions in the  near term would likely prompt a negative rating action, given the limited  flexibility associated with the company's current leverage. RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed STJ's ratings as follows: --IDR at 'A'; --Senior unsecured bank debt at 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A';  --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Commercial paper at 'F1'.

44,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, September 14 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has downgraded St. Jude Medical,  Inc.'s (STJ/St. Jude) long-term ratings to 'A-' from 'A', and its short-term  rating to 'F2' from 'F1'. The ratings are removed from Negative Rating Watch,  and assigned a Stable Outlook. See the full list of rating actions at the end of  this release. Fitch has also assigned an 'A-' rating to the company's $1.5 billion notes  offering, which will be used to partly fund its recently announced $3.4 billion  cash acquisition of Thoratec Corporation (Thoratec).  KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating actions reflect the following: --Fitch believes the acquisition of Thoratec is strategically constructive and  provides an adjacent product platform to STJ's cardiovascular business, as well  as an expansion of its treatment offerings for heart failure patients.  --The acquisition will increase leverage (total debt/EBITDA) in the intermediate  term, which was already stressed for the company's 'A' rating. --The stabilizing domestic cardiac rhythm management (CRM) market, new product  introductions, and emerging market opportunities should support mid-single-digit  organic revenue growth for STJ during 2015 and beyond. --STJ's focus on cost control and improving its sales mix should more than  offset pricing headwinds and incrementally improve margins during 2015-2017. --Decent sales growth and modestly improving margins will drive strong and  consistently positive free cash flow (FCF). --Fitch anticipates that STJ will maintain adequate liquidity through cash  balances, reliably positive FCF and ready access to the credit markets. THORATEC ACQUISITION STRATEGICALLY SOUND STJ's decision to enter into the mechanical circulatory support market through  the acquisition of Thoratec will help to expand the company's presence in  treating heart failure patients. The demand for heart pumps should increase over  time, given the increasing number of new heart failure patients. In addition,  these devices can provide health and economic benefits to patients and payors,  to the extent that they can more effectively and more safely treat patients than  with alternative treatments.  Thoratec's device platforms are adjacent to STJ's current cardiovascular  platforms. Potential sales and technological synergies exist between the two's  product platforms. STJ forecasts only modest operating cost synergies, however,  although it should also be able to augment the growth in Thoratec's products  through its scale. Thoratec operates in the ventricular-assist heart pump  market, which is a duopoly, and has a roughly 58% market share. In addition,  Fitch expects Thoratec to enter what will most likely become a duopolistic  percutaneous heart pump market in the near future.  TRANSACTION WILL INCREASE LEVERAGE STJ expects to close the transaction in fourth quarter 2015 (4Q15), and leverage  will likely increase above what is already a stressed balance sheet for similar  'A' rated issuers, precipitating Fitch's downgrade to 'A-'. Despite STJ's  expected operating stability and acquisition-related opportunities to enhance  growth, Fitch believes that leverage will remain above 1.7x during the  intermediate term. GROWTH EXPECTED Fitch looks for STJ to generate mid-single-digit organic revenue growth during  the next 12-24 months. Growth will be supported by new product introductions,  growth in recently introduced products, and expansion into faster growing  product and geographic markets. These factors should more than offset a soft CRM  market and foreign exchange rate headwinds. STJ has recently launched, or will soon launch devices in all four of its  business segments (CRM, Atrial Fibrillation, Cardiovascular  and  Neuromodulation ). A number of these devices are differentiated by their  clinical effectiveness and safety profiles, as well as by their ability to  reduce medical costs compared to competing devices. Fitch believes the company's  new product development and commercialization efforts will continue to support  favorable pricing and potentially incremental market share gains. IMPROVING MARGINS Fitch forecasts improving margins for STJ, despite some persistent headwinds.  STJ margins have remained relatively strong, owing to mix shift to newer and  higher margin devices and its ongoing focus on cost control which offset a more  challenging hospital reimbursement environment and the ACA excise tax. Longer  term, Fitch expects margins will benefit from continued gains in operational  efficiency and favorable shifts in product sales mix. RELIABLE FCF Increasing revenue with improving margins should result in STJ generating $800  million - $1.1 billion of annual FCF (cash flow from operations minus capital  expenditures of roughly $250 million minus dividends of roughly $320 million)  during the next two years. Cash generation should be sufficient to fund roughly  $2.3 billion of debt reduction that will likely be needed to maintain the 'A-'  rating if the acquisition is executed as announced. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for St. Jude Medical, Inc.  include: --Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; --Stressed leverage in the intermediate term mainly due to the proposed Thoratec  acquisition; --Improving margins of 50-75 basis points by 2017 with consistently positive and  solid FCF of $800 million - $.1 billion annually; --Adequate liquidity from balance sheet cash and adequate access to the bank and  credit markets; --Roughly $2.3 billion in debt reduction within approximately two years of the  acquisition. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: An upgrade is not anticipated in the near- to intermediate-term. However, STJ  would need to commit to and operate with leverage stronger than 1.6x-1.7x while  maintaining relatively stable operations and solid FCF, in order for Fitch to  consider a positive rating action. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following: --Debt sustained above 2x-2.1x EBITDA without the prospect of timely  deleveraging.  --Stressed leverage could result from a scenario in which revenue and margins  are significantly stressed (more than Fitch anticipates), resulting in weakening  FCF, and capital deployment not being adjusted to reduce the company's need for  debt financing.  --As such, significant debt-financed share repurchases or acquisitions in the  near term would likely prompt a negative rating action, given the limited  flexibility associated with the company's forecasted leverage during the next  two years. LIQUIDITY At July 4, 2015, STJ had adequate liquidity, comprising approximately $910  million in cash plus short-term marketable securities and roughly $251 million  (net of $1.25 billion commercial paper borrowings) in availability on its  $1.5 billion bank revolving credit facility, which expires in August 2020. STJ  generated approximately $690 million in FCF (net of $179 million of capital  expenditures and $312 million of dividends) during latest 12 months (LTM), ended  July 4, 2015.  The company had approximately $3.75 billion in debt with (including $1.25  million in CP outstanding) approximately $52 million maturing in 2015, $675  million in 2016, $1.25 billion in 2018 and $1.77 billion thereafter. Fitch  expects STJ to refinance the majority of its non-bank-loan maturities, utilizing  its anticipated access to credit markets. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has downgraded the following ratings: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A-' from 'A'; --Senior unsecured bank debt to 'A-' from 'A'; --Senior unsecured debt to 'A-' from 'A';  --Short-term IDR to 'F2' from 'F1'; --Commercial paper to F2' from 'F1'.

58,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 28 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed St. Jude Medical, Inc. (STJ,  St. Jude) on Rating Watch Negative. The rating action follows Abbott  Laboratories' (ABT, Abbott) announcement of its intention to acquire St. Jude. Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch as more details regarding the transactions  become available. However, given the currently available information and  assuming Abbott acquires both Alere and St. Jude, Fitch will likely downgrade  St. Jude to 'BBB'. St. Jude had approximately $6.43 billion in outstanding debt at Jan. 2, 2016. A  full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Sound Acquisitions/High Leverage: Abbott's planned acquisition of St. Jude for  an equity value of roughly $25 billion ($46.75 in cash and 0.8708 shares of  Abbott common stock per share of St. Jude) plus approximately $5.7 billion net  debt (which will be assumed or refinanced) is a good strategic fit. St. Jude  will expand Abbott's market presence in segments that Abbott currently operates,  by providing it with broader product offerings. The acquired portfolio, in  aggregate, will also offer organic growth potential.  The acquisition will significantly increase Abbott's debt, with leverage  forecasted (assuming Abbott also acquires Alere) to remain above 3.0x through  2019. Fitch expects Abbott will reduce leverage to durably below 3.0x  thereafter, through a combination of debt reduction and increased EBITDA.  Operating margins will likely improve because of favorable shifts in sales mix,  good cost control and synergies. FCF should stay significantly positive  (excluding one-time restructuring costs). The potential 'BBB' post-transaction  rating for St. Jude assumes that Abbott will pursue a more conservative approach  to capital deployment, with share repurchases, dividend increases and  acquisitions remaining modest. The transaction is likely to close near year-end 2016, pending regulatory  approvals and St. Jude shareholder approval. The addition of St. Jude's products  will significantly expand Abbott's medical device portfolio, particularly in the  area of cardiovascular disease. The deal will position Abbott as the number-one  or number-two player in many of the sub-segments of the cardiovascular device  market. The combination provides minimal overlap in product categories and  offers Abbott a larger presence in the faster growing device areas of atrial  fibrillation, structural heart and neuromodulation. Abbott estimates it will realize roughly $500 million in annual synergies by  2020 from the St. Jude acquisition. Broader portfolios within the sub-segments  of cardiovascular should provide Abbott with increased bundling/shelf space  opportunities when contracting with hospital management and purchasing groups.  Cost-related synergies in the areas of sourcing plus some overlap in sales force  and administrative functions should be attainable. In addition, Abbott has a  demonstrable record of accomplishment of acquiring and successfully integrating  acquisitions. Thoratec Acquisition Strategically Sound: St. Jude's entered the mechanical  circulatory support market through the acquisition of Thoratec on Oct. 8, 2015.  The transaction will help to expand St. Jude's presence in treating heart  failure patients. Thoratec's device platforms are adjacent to St. Jude's current  cardiovascular platforms. Potential sales and technological synergies exist  between the two's product platforms.  St. Jude forecasts only modest operating cost synergies, but it should also be  able to augment the growth in Thoratec's products through its scale. The  acquisition was a cash transaction valued at approximately $3.4 billion, net of  cash acquired. The transaction further stressed leverage, and Fitch believes  that leverage will remain above 1.7x during the intermediate term. Growth Expected: St. Jude will likely generate mid-single-digit organic revenue  growth during the next 12-24 months. Growth will be supported by new product  introductions, growth in recently introduced products, and expansion into faster  growing product and geographic markets. These factors should more than offset a  soft CRM market and foreign exchange rate headwinds. St. Jude has recently launched, or will soon launch devices in all four of its  business segments (CRM, Atrial Fibrillation, Cardiovascular  and  Neuromodulation ). A number of these devices are differentiated by their  clinical effectiveness and safety profiles, as well as by their ability to  reduce medical costs compared to competing devices. Fitch believes the company's  new product development and commercialization efforts will continue to support  favorable pricing and potentially incremental market share gains. Improving Margins: Fitch forecasts improving margins for St. Jude, despite some  persistent headwinds. They have remained relatively strong, owing to mix shift  to newer and higher margin devices and its ongoing focus on cost control which  offset a more challenging hospital reimbursement environment. Longer-term, Fitch  expects margins will benefit from continued gains in operational efficiency and  favorable shifts in product sales mix. Reliable FCF: Increasing revenue with improving margins should result in St.  Jude generating $800 million - $1.1 billion of annual FCF (cash flow from  operations minus capital expenditures of roughly $250 million minus dividends of  roughly $320 million) during the next two years. Cash generation should be  sufficient to fund roughly $2.3 billion of debt reduction. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for standalone St. Jude Medical,  Inc. include: --Mid-single-digit organic revenue growth; --Stressed leverage in the intermediate term mainly due to the proposed Thoratec  acquisition; --Improving margins of 50-75 basis points by 2017 with consistently positive and  solid FCF of $800 million - $.1 billion annually; --Adequate liquidity from balance sheet cash and adequate access to the bank and  credit markets; --Roughly $2.3 billion in debt reduction within approximately two years of the  acquisition. RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch will resolve the Rating Watch once more details regarding the transaction  are available. However, given the currently available information and assuming  Abbott acquires both Alere and St. Jude, Fitch believes St. Jude's ratings would  likely move to 'BBB'. The following rating sensitivities are for standalone St. Jude. Positive: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  positive rating action include the following: An upgrade is not anticipated in the near to intermediate term. However, St.  Jude would need to commit to and operate with leverage stronger than 1.6x-1.7x  while maintaining relatively stable operations and solid FCF, in order for Fitch  to consider a positive rating action. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include the following: --Debt sustained above 2.0x-2.1x EBITDA without the prospect of timely  deleveraging.  --Stressed leverage could result from a scenario in which revenue and margins  are significantly stressed (more than Fitch anticipates), resulting in weakening  FCF, and capital deployment not being adjusted to reduce the company's need for  debt financing.  --As such, significant debt-financed share repurchases or acquisitions in the  near term would likely prompt a negative rating action, given the limited  flexibility associated with the company's forecasted leverage during the next  two years. LIQUIDITY At Jan. 2, 2016, St. Jude had adequate liquidity, comprising approximately $667  million in cash plus short-term marketable securities and roughly $996 million  (net of $504 million commercial paper borrowings) in availability on its  $1.5 billion bank revolving credit facility, which expires in August 2020. St.  Jude generated approximately $531 million in FCF (net of $186 million of capital  expenditures and $322 million of dividends) during latest 12 months (LTM), ended  Jan. 2, 2016.  The company had approximately $6.43 billion in debt with (including $504 million  in CP outstanding) approximately $1,163 million maturing in 2017, $173 million  in 2018, $658 million in 2019 and $4.32 billion thereafter. Fitch expects St.  Jude to refinance the majority of its non-bank-loan maturities, utilizing its  anticipated access to credit markets. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has placed the following ratings on Rating Watch Negative: St. Jude Medical, Inc. --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A-'; --Senior unsecured bank debt 'A-'; --Senior unsecured debt 'A-';  --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --CP 'F2'. Fitch expects that Abbott would pay down St. Jude's outstanding CP upon the  close of the transaction. Contact:  Primary Analyst Bob Kirby Director  +1-312-368-3147  Fitch Ratings, Inc. 70 W.

65,"   By Jonathan Stempel  St. Jude Medical Inc has reached a $39.25 million class action settlement with shareholders to resolve claims it downplayed the possible dangers associated with a product used to connect implantable defibrillators to patients' hearts.The preliminary settlement, disclosed Thursday with the U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, requires a judge's approval.It resolves claims that St. Jude inflated its stock price by concealing risks revealed in a November 2012 U.S. Food and Drug Administration report about its Durata lead, a cable linking the heart to a defibrillator.St. Jude used a material called Optim to insulate Durata and help preserve its ability to deliver needed electric shocks.But the FDA report raised questions about whether St. Jude had properly tested Durata, and whether the lead could face problems similar to what prompted a 2011 recall of Riata, a lead that was prone to failure because the insulation wore away. St. Jude's share price fell more than 12 percent on Nov. 21, 2012, the day after the FDA report was released, wiping out roughly $1.3 billion of its market value.The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company denied liability in agreeing to the settlement, which averted a February 2017 trial.St. Jude had no immediate comment on Friday. In a May 4 regulatory filing, it said it had not taken a charge for a possible settlement. The company reported $880 million of profit on net sales of $5.54 billion for 2015. Abbott Laboratories agreed in April to buy St. Jude for about $25 billion.Forsta AP-Fonden of Sweden and Danske Invest Management A/S of Denmark led the class action on behalf of St. Jude shareholders from Feb. 5, 2010 to Nov. 20, 2012.

69,"   By Amrutha Penumudi  Abbott Laboratories reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit as strong sales in its medical device business more than made up for the hit from an economic turmoil in Venezuela.Abbott is one of the major U.S. companies to be affected by troubled operations in Venezuela.The Latin American nation's economy contracted by 4.5 percent in the first nine months of last year as plunging oil prices, and what critics of President Nicolas Maduro see as policy missteps, took an increasing toll.Venezuela's official annual inflation rate was the world's highest at 141.5 percent in the nine months.Abbott, which rakes in two-thirds of its revenue from outside the United States, said emerging market sales increased 1.1 percent but would have risen 4.8 percent excluding the impact of Venezuelan operations.The company's results, however, beat Wall Street estimates, largely helped by its booming medical device business, where sales rose 6.4 percent to $1.37 billion in the second quarter. Abbott's device unit develops products for heart, diabetes and eye patients and has been helped by launches including glucose monitor FreeStyle Libre and MitraClip, which repairs heart valves less invasively.Abbott is in the process of acquiring St. Jude Medical Inc for $25 billion. St. Jude on Wednesday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue roughly in line with Wall Street estimates.Miles White, chief executive of Abbott, said he had still expected to close the transaction before year-end, as the company prepares to respond to a second request of information from the U.S. Federal Trade Commision. Abbott's acquisition of diagnostic company Alere Inc however, continues to see challenges, especially after Alere was subpoenaed by the U.S. Department of Justice over its sales practices.Alere rejected a request by Abbott to terminate the deal for a breakup fee in April.""To be honest, no matter what kind of teeth grinding and gnashing we go through with them .. one thing I'm certain of is that they are trying to do everything they can, in their way to address the challenges,"" Miles said on a conference call with analysts. On an adjusted basis, Abbott earned 55 cents per share in the quarter ended June 30, above the average analyst estimate of 53 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company's net sales rose 3.2 percent to $5.33 billion, beating analysts' estimate of $5.24 billion. (prn.to/2atEUVO)Abbott's shares were up 2.3 percent at $42.76 in mid-morning trading.

71,"  Aug 25 Shares of medical device maker St Jude Medical Inc fell sharply on Thursday after short-selling firm Muddy Waters said it had placed a bet that the shares would fall because of cyber security vulnerabilities in a cardiac device.Shares of St Jude, which agreed in April to be purchased by Abbott Laboratories, were last down nearly 4 percent on heavy volume after Carson Block, head of the firm Muddy Waters, announced his position against the stock on Twitter. He also discussed the rationale for his position on Bloomberg television. Block also said he has taken a ""long"" position in Abbott, a bet that its stock will rise. Abbott shares were little changed following the report.  Representatives for St. Jude and Abbott had no immediate comment. But St. Jude told Bloomberg it takes the security of its devices seriously.

72,"   By Jim Finkle  Medical device manufacturer St. Jude Medical Inc (STJ.N) said on Friday a report by short-selling firm Muddy Waters and a cyber-security researcher alleging its heart devices were riddled with bugs was ""false and misleading."" The report, which caused St. Jude shares to fall 5 percent  after its release on Thursday, alleged there were significant security bugs in the company's Merlin@home device for monitoring implanted heart devices. St. Jude chief technology officer Phil Ebeling on Thursday said ""the allegations are absolutely untrue"" but provided no specific examples of errors.St. Jude on Friday said most of the observations in the report applied to older versions of its Merlin@home devices, which had not been patched with security upgrades that the company automatically pushes out to customers. ""We want to reassure our patients that our systems meet the highest international security requirements, as required by regulatory authorities and international standards organizations,"" St Jude said. Muddy Waters late on Friday said it plans to publicly refute the response of St. Jude, which in April agreed to sell itself for $25 billion to Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N).""This was a missed opportunity for St. Jude to take responsibility for their flawed devices,"" the short seller said in a statement."" MedSec executives could not be reached for comment.Muddy Waters had no immediate response to St Jude's claim that the testing was done on older versions of its devices with unpatched software. ""We continue to stand by the report and are pleased the company has actually decided to respond to the allegations."" St. Jude shares closed marginally higher on Friday after the company released its statement following a halt in trading. Earlier they had traded as low as $75.34 in heavy trade.Muddy Waters founder Carson Block said on Thursday he decided to short the stock after MedSec approached Muddy Waters about three months ago with results of research it had conducted into its medical device security.The two struck a deal under which Block agreed to hire the cyber security firm as a consultant, pay it a licensing fee for the research and a percentage of any profits from the investment, Block said. In its rebuttal on Friday, St Jude said the researchers used a ""flawed test methodology on outdated software,"" demonstrating ""lack of understanding of medical device technology."" Beau Woods, a medical-device security expert with the non-profit Atlantic Council, said that while he had no knowledge of MedSec’s research methodology, St. Jude’s explanation sounded reasonable.“It makes sense that they would not have the current versions of software; that rings true to me,” said Woods. He said that medical device makers typically push out regular updates to their software, which include security patches.

73,"   By Carl O'Donnell and Lauren Hirsch  One day after a short seller claimed that St. Jude Medical Inc's (STJ.N) heart implants are vulnerable to deadly cyber attacks, investors appear most concerned about whether the accusation will derail St. Jude's $24 billion planned deal for Abbott Labs (ABT.N) to buy it.St. Jude's stock at one point fell around 3 percent on Friday, though it ended the day slightly up, following a drop of around 5 percent on Thursday after Muddy Waters Capital leveled the accusation against St. Jude. The stock continues to trade well below its price on Wednesday of around $82 per share.    St. Jude called the allegations ""false and misleading.""    St. Jude in April agreed to sell itself to Abbott, and the deal was widely considered a slam dunk before the cyber security concerns were raised.     ""It's hard to imagine that this could scuttle the deal,"" said one investor, who asked to remain anonymous because he wasn't authorized to speak with the press. ""But there are a few paths that could lead to problems.""

75,"   By Jim Finkle  Medical device manufacturer St. Jude Medical Inc (STJ.N) said on Friday a report by short-selling firm Muddy Waters and a cyber-security researcher alleging its heart devices were riddled with bugs was ""false and misleading."" The report, which caused St. Jude shares to fall 5 percent  after its release on Thursday, alleged there were significant security bugs in the company's Merlin@home device for monitoring implanted heart devices. St. Jude chief technology officer Phil Ebeling on Thursday said ""the allegations are absolutely untrue"" but provided no specific examples of errors.St. Jude on Friday said most of the observations in the report applied to older versions of its Merlin@home devices, which had not been patched with security upgrades that the company automatically pushes out to customers. ""We want to reassure our patients that our systems meet the highest international security requirements, as required by regulatory authorities and international standards organizations,"" St Jude said. Muddy Waters late on Friday said it plans to publicly refute the response of St. Jude, which in April agreed to sell itself for $25 billion to Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N).""This was a missed opportunity for St. Jude to take responsibility for their flawed devices,"" the short seller said in a statement."" MedSec executives could not be reached for comment.Muddy Waters had no immediate response to St Jude's claim that the testing was done on older versions of its devices with unpatched software. ""We continue to stand by the report and are pleased the company has actually decided to respond to the allegations."" St. Jude shares closed marginally higher on Friday after the company released its statement following a halt in trading. Earlier they had traded as low as $75.34 in heavy trade.Muddy Waters founder Carson Block said on Thursday he decided to short the stock after MedSec approached Muddy Waters about three months ago with results of research it had conducted into its medical device security.The two struck a deal under which Block agreed to hire the cyber security firm as a consultant, pay it a licensing fee for the research and a percentage of any profits from the investment, Block said. In its rebuttal on Friday, St Jude said the researchers used a ""flawed test methodology on outdated software,"" demonstrating ""lack of understanding of medical device technology."" Beau Woods, a medical-device security expert with the non-profit Atlantic Council, said that while he had no knowledge of MedSec’s research methodology, St. Jude’s explanation sounded reasonable.“It makes sense that they would not have the current versions of software; that rings true to me,” said Woods. He said that medical device makers typically push out regular updates to their software, which include security patches.

""If the deal were to break, I think that we could be $55 or lower,"" Block told cable television network CNBC. That implied a drop of more than 27 percent from St. Jude's current share price. St. Jude agreed in April to be purchased by Abbott Laboratories. Muddy Waters unveiled a ""short"" bet on Thursday that St. Jude's shares would fall because of cyber security vulnerabilities in a cardiac device.St. Jude said Friday that Muddy Waters' report on its heart devices was ""false and misleading."" Shares of the company, which were halted before the company's statement, resumed trading and were last down 0.18 percent at $77.68 a share. Block said on Thursday the firm's position was motivated by research from a cyber security firm, MedSec Holdings Inc, which has a financial arrangement with Muddy Waters. MedSec asserted that St. Jude's heart devices were vulnerable to cyber attack and were a risk to patients.A MedSec report warned of two primary hacks on St. Jude pacemakers and defibrillators: One that could cause implanted devices to pace at potentially dangerous rates and one that drains their batteries. MedSec approached Muddy Waters about three months ago and the two struck a deal under which Block agreed to hire MedSec as a consultant, pay it a licensing fee for research and a percentage of any profits from the investment, Block told Reuters.  Reuters was not able to confirm the allegations by Block and MedSec, a firm founded 18 months ago focusing on cyber vulnerabilities in the healthcare industry.

For public figures, such as politicians or celebrities, there is an added burden of showing statements were not just false, but also published willfully and maliciously.Under Minnesota law, St Jude, as a company whose products have health implications, will almost certainly be considered a public figure and have to meet that tougher standard, said Minneapolis media lawyer Mark Anfinson, who has his own practice.But that does not necessarily mean Muddy Waters and MedSec are out of the woods, Anfinson said. The actual malice defense, more commonly wielded by the press, may not prove as powerful for a short-seller with a financial motive to cause a stock to fall.""They may not get the benefit of the doubt"" on malice, said Anfinson.Muddy Waters said in its report that St. Jude's pacemakers and defibrillators, which are used to regulate heart rhythm and treat cardiac arrest, had cyber security flaws that enabled them to be hacked and manipulated, with potentially fatal consequences.

89,"   By Jim Finkle  Oct 11 St. Jude Medical Inc warned on Tuesday that some of its implanted heart devices are at risk of premature battery depletion, a condition it said has been linked to two patient deaths and could require the replacement of some devices.News of the issue surfaced on Monday evening when short-selling firm Muddy Waters tweeted a copy of a physician advisory on the matter from St. Jude, which agreed in April to sell itself for $25 billion to Abbott Laboratories.That letter said such problems with the lithium batteries that power the devices were rare and could be identified by patients using tools for monitoring battery levels from their homes.Out of nearly 400,000 devices manufactured through May of last year, the company has identified 841 failed implanted cardioverter defibrillators with lithium clusters, which can form after a device delivers electricity to the heart, according to St. Jude.Lithium clusters sometimes cause battery power to deplete quickly, making devices unable to deliver doses of electricity when needed, St. Jude Vice President of Quality Control Jeff Fecho said in the letter to physicians. ""There have been two deaths that have been associated with the loss of defibrillation therapy as a result of premature battery depletion,"" Fecho said.The company advised physicians to replace devices with damaged batteries immediately, but cautioned against swapping out devices that were operating normally because of the potential for complications from such procedures.""We encourage any patient with questions about their medical device to contact their doctor,"" St. Jude Chief Medical Officer Mark Carlson said in a statement. ""While this risk is very small, we have provided doctors with information so that they can discuss the most appropriate course of action for each individual patient,"" Carlson said.St. Jude said it planned to launch a webpage on Tuesday where patients could see which devices were affected: (www.sjm.com/batteryadvisory). The site tells patients how they can monitor battery activity, look for vibrating alerts when batteries are low and connect to the Merlin.net remote monitoring service.The alert comes as St. Jude defends itself against unrelated allegations that its heart devices are riddled with bugs that make them vulnerable to fatal cyber hacks.The Food and Drug Administration is investigating the claims by Muddy Waters and research firm MedSec Holdings Inc.St. Jude has denied the allegations and sued both firms, saying they disseminated false information to manipulate its stock price.(Reporting by Jim Finkle in BOSTON; Editing by Paul Tait)",2016-10-11,STJ,"Tue Oct 11, 2016 | 7:00am EDT",St. Jude warns of heart-device battery issue linked to 2 deaths,http://www.reuters.com//article/st-jude-medical-batteries-idUSL1N1CH053?type=companyNews,-0.9432,0.069,0.908,0.023

The board, whose membership has yet to be finalized, will work with technology experts at St. Jude Medical as well as external researchers to help ""maintain and enhance cyber security and patient safety,” Carlson said.

100,"   By Ransdell Pierson and Natalie Grover  Abbott Laboratories said on Wednesday it was pushing ahead to complete its planned purchases of medical device maker St. Jude Medical Inc and diagnostics company Alere Inc despite lingering questions about product safety and government investigations.Abbott Chief Executive Officer Miles White on a conference call with analysts said he hoped to acquire St. Jude by the end of the year and praised the smaller company's handling of claims by short-seller Muddy Waters that its implantable heart devices posed cyber security risks.Although White said Abbott was pursuing all necessary regulatory approvals to acquire Alere, he did not go so far as to predict the deal would be approved. ""We'll work through regulatory approvals and see what happens,"" White said on the call.Shares of Abbott fell 2.7 percent to $40.04 while Alere rose 2.3 percent to $43.36 and St. Jude dipped 0.6 percent to $79, all on the New York Stock Exchange.Stifel Nicolaus analyst Rick Wise attributed Abbott's  decline to lingering uncertainty about the St. Jude and Alere deals, and worries about declining overseas sales of Abbott's baby formulas.""There's a lot of concern and noise,"" he said. ""Any hint of anything is making people anxious."" Abbott agreed in February to buy Alere for $5.8 billion, to acquire its diagnostic tests performed at home and in doctors' offices and hospitals. Just two months later it agreed to pay $25 billion for St. Jude, a leading maker of heart devices. The combined price of the two deals amounted to half of Abbott's market valuation.The relationship between Abbott and Alere cooled after the target company failed to file financial statements and disclosed probes into billing and foreign sales practices. Moreover, in July, at the request of the Food and Drug Administration, Alere recalled its INRatio device used to monitor levels of the widely used blood thinner warfarin because it was found to generate faulty results. In August, Alere filed a lawsuit accusing Abbott of dragging its feet on key antitrust submissions to sabotage the deal.Separately on Wednesday, Abbott reported a quarterly profit that edged past estimates as strength in its medical devices business more than offset a decline in its nutrition unit.Excluding items, Abbott earned 59 cents per share on sales of $5.30 billion in the third quarter.Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 58 cents per share on revenue of $5.29 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Global sales of nutritional products, including baby formula Similac and Ensure for adults, fell 2 percent to $1.76 billion. Sales of the products outside the United States dropped 9.4 percent, largely due to declines in China, which is requiring manufacturers to reregister their baby formulas with the government to greater ensure their safety.""The situation in China is leading to a lot of unusually high (price) discounting,"" Stifel Nicolaus' Wise said.In the longer term, however, he said Abbott could benefit as many rival makers of infant formula vanish from the Chinese market due to stricter regulations.Also on Wednesday St. Jude reported its quarterly adjusted profit was 99 cents, missing the average estimate by 2 cents.St. Jude is facing multiple problems, including an investigation by the FDA over claims its heart devices have defects that make them vulnerable to fatal cyber hacks. The company has sued short-seller Muddy Waters and cyber research firm MedSec Holdings after they claimed flaws in the cyber security of Abbott's devices.St. Jude CEO Michael Rousseau said on a conference call on Wednesday he expected Muddy Waters to continue to ""mislead"" investors and patients about the cyber safety of its devices.Muddy Waters released several videos on Wednesday morning that claimed to be demonstrations of how attacks could be launched on St. Jude's implanted heart devices.  Reuters was unable to independently confirm claims in the videos, which were posted on a new website set up by Muddy Waters, www.profitsoverpatients.com.A St. Jude spokeswoman said the company had not verified the claims in the videos.In an unrelated matter last week, St. Jude said it will recall some of its 400,000 implanted heart devices due to the risk of premature battery depletion, a condition linked to two deaths in Europe.St. Jude and Abbott on Tuesday announced a $1.12 billion deal to sell some of their devices to Japan-based Terumo Corp, an important step toward completing their tie-up.

106,"   By Jim Finkle  Short-selling firm Muddy Waters said in a legal filing on Monday that outside experts it hired validated its claims that St. Jude Medical Inc  cardiac implants are vulnerable to potentially life-threatening cyber attacks.U.S. regulators responded by reiterating previous advice that patients should keep using the devices, and a St. Jude spokeswoman said the company would respond ""through appropriate legal channels.""Muddy Waters released a 53-page report from boutique cyber security firm Bishop Fox as part of a legal filing in federal court in Minnesota in its defense against a suit brought by St. Jude. Bishop Fox said in the report it validated the claims with help from well-known specialists in cryptography, computer hardware hacking, forensics and wireless communications, and cyber research firm MedSec Holdings that St. Jude cardiac implants are susceptible to hacking. St. Paul, Minnesota-based St. Jude has strongly disputed those claims, which are under investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One of the world's biggest makers of implantable cardiac devices, St. Jude filed a lawsuit against San Francisco-based Muddy Waters, Miami-based MedSec and individuals affiliated with those firms on Sept. 7.St. Jude accused them of intentionally disseminating false information about its heart devices to manipulate its stock price, which fell 5 percent the day they went public with their claims.The FDA said in a statement it had no comment on the litigation but that based on information obtained to date it urged patients to continue using devices as directed by their physicians. ""The benefits of the devices far outweigh any potential cyber security vulnerabilities,"" the FDA said of St. Jude's cardiac implants, which the company said have been implanted in hundreds of thousands of patients.St. Jude spokeswoman Candace Steele Flippin said the company's lawyers were reviewing the documents from Muddy Waters and MedSec.""We continue to feel this lawsuit is the best course of action to make sure those looking to profit by trying to frighten patients and caregivers are held accountable for their actions,"" she said in an email.St. Jude in April agreed to sell itself for $25 billion to Abbott Laboratories. Short sellers like Muddy Waters make bets that stock prices will fall, selling borrowed shares so they can buy them at a lower price and profit from the difference.The defendants said that St. Jude's lawsuit is without merit, reiterating their prior claim that St. Jude's heart devices have ""significant security vulnerabilities.""""Muddy Waters' and MedSec's statements regarding security issues in the St. Jude Medical implant ecosystem were, by and large, accurate,"" Bishop Fox Partner Carl Livitt said in the report. The report said the wireless communications in St. Jude cardiac devices are vulnerable to hacking, making it possible for hackers to convert the company's Merlin@home patient monitoring devices into ""weapons"" that can cause cardiac implants to stop providing care and deliver shocks to patients.

St. Jude, which is being acquired by Abbott Laboratories, said it had seven reports of lost telemetry and heart pacing output from the devices.Of a total of 1,423 Nanostim devices implanted worldwide, 1,397 remain in service and represent a potential risk to patients, the company warned.There have been no reports of patient injury associated with the malfunction, St. Jude said.""We are currently working to ensure our physician partners worldwide have the information they need to effectively manage their patients,"" St. Jude Chief Medical Officer Mark Carlson said in a statement, adding that the company remains committed to developing leadless pacing technology.

Abbott, which also makes prescription drugs and diagnostics, had no immediate comment. St. Jude officials could not be reached for comment.Abbott Chief Executive Miles White in October said he hoped to acquire St. Jude by the end of the year, despite lingering questions about the safety of its implantable heart devices.The suburban Chicago company announced the St. Jude deal in April to expand its heart device business and help it compete against larger rivals Medtronic Plc (MDT.N) and Boston Scientific Corp (BSX.N).The companies offered concessions to address the European Commission's concerns on Oct. 31 but did not disclose details.  However, two weeks before that, they announced the sale of some of their medical devices worth about $1.12 billion to Japanese company Terumo Corp (4543.T), saying the move was part of their deal.The all-cash transaction included St. Jude Medical's Angio-Seal and Femoseal vascular closure products and Abbott's Vado Steerable Sheath.St. Jude is facing multiple problems, including an investigation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration over claims its heart devices have defects that make them vulnerable to fatal cyber hacks. The company sued short-seller Muddy Waters and its investment partner, cyber research firm MedSec Holdings, after they claimed flaws in the cyber security of its devices. MedSec warned the alleged flaws could cause implanted devices to pace at potentially dangerous rates or have their batteries drained.After Abbott reported stronger than expected earnings on Oct. 19, White praised the way St. Jude has handled Muddy Waters' allegations. In an unrelated matter last month, St. Jude said it will recall some of its 400,000 implanted heart devices due to the risk of premature battery depletion, a condition linked to two deaths in Europe.Shares of Abbott and St. Jude both closed 1.6 percent higher on Tuesday amid moderate gains for the broad stock market.Mergers in the sector have underscored the pressure felt by medical equipment makers to scale up and offer a wider range of products to hospital customers.

That compared with 77 percent for those who received the older device.HeartMate 3 was designed to prevent blood from clogging in the mechanism, a complication known as pump thrombosis that can lead to major surgery to replace the device.While survival and stroke rates were similar, there was no pump thrombosis with HeartMate 3 versus 18 cases in the older device, based on data from the first 294 patients in a study that intends to enroll more than 1,000.HeartMate 3 is approved in Europe.

The study included both patients who needed a short-term  option while awaiting a heart transplant or long-term support because they were not candidates for transplantation.Nearly 6 million Americans are living with heart failure, a leading cause of hospitalization, and a condition that causes shortness of breath and difficulty performing daily activities. These devices do the work of the left ventricle by pumping blood into the aorta. HeartMate 3 has wider blood passages and its rotor is suspended by magnetic forces to prevent damage to red blood cells. It also fits entirely inside the chest cavity, while the larger model must be placed below the diaphragm. And it appears to provide a benefit sure to cheer patients and payers.""If you have a pump that does not require a repeat surgery to replace it, that is a very clear health economic advantage,"" Mehra said.

143,"  FRANKFURT Jan 14 U.S. aerospace components maker Transdigm and European buyout groups Cinven  and EQT are all exploring an acquisition of cargo handler Telair in a potential $700-800 million deal, two people familiar with the transaction said.Aviation support company AAR Corp has asked for final bids for its Germany-headquartered business by late January or early February, the sources said.U.S. industrial conglomerate Honeywell and aviation firm Triumph are also considering making final bids for Telair, one of the sources said.Telair has annual core earnings (EBITDA) of about $70 million and the company could fetch more than ten times that, the sources said. Previously, sources had said that Telair may be valued at up to $1 billion in a potential sale.Telair's workers fear that a sale to an industry  player may cause severe job cuts as seen after TransDigm's acquisition of a Telair unit in 2010, an employee representative said. Telair, Honeywell, Cinven and EQT declined to comment, while Transdigm and Triumph were not available for comment.Previously owned by Teleflex, Telair was sold to AAR along with Nordisk Aviation Products in 2011 for a combined $280 million. Telair designs, manufactures and supports on-board baggage and cargo systems, such as its ""Sliding Carpet"" device, for companies including Airbus and Boeing.Since the 2011 acquisition Telair has bought Germany's PFW Aerospace, boosting its loading-system assets.Telair's low capital expenditure and ability to free up cash quickly makes it attractive to private equity bidders, sources familiar with the asset have said.

A fall in sales to defense customers led to AAR posting lower revenue in the year ended May 31, the first decline in four years.The company's revenue has missed market estimates for four of the past six quarter.
