0,"  (Adds details from decision, case history, comments, first-quarter results, byline)By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK, April 23 A U.S. appeals court has revived a European Union lawsuit accusing R.J. Reynolds of running a global money-laundering scheme with organized crime groups that involved the smuggling of drugs and cigarettes.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a lower court judge erred in finding that a U.S. anti-racketeering law known as RICO did not cover foreign conduct, barring claims by France, Germany, Italy and 23 other European countries.In a lawsuit begun in 2002, the EU had sued RJ Reynolds and related entities for unspecified damages, accusing them of running a decade-long scheme involving Colombian and Russian crime syndicates that hurt economies and legitimate marketplaces, and deprived member nations of tax revenue.RJ Reynolds is now part of Reynolds American Inc, the 2nd-largest U.S. tobacco company, whose cigarette brands include Camel and Pall Mall.Writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, Circuit Judge Pierre Leval said the U.S. Congress ""unmistakably"" intended RICO to cover conduct such as RJ Reynolds' alleged wrongdoing.He said this was because some of the criminal laws underlying RICO necessarily involve foreign conduct, and that violating those laws can provide a basis for a finding of ""racketeering activity"" that is punishable under RICO.""Indeed, it is hard to imagine why Congress would incorporate these statutes as RICO predicates if RICO could never have extraterritorial application,"" he wrote. RICO stands for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations. The case is the latest to turn on a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Morrison v. National Australia Bank, that found a presumption against applying U.S. laws to conduct that occurred outside the country.Wednesday's decision overturned a 2011 dismissal of claims brought under federal and New York state law by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn. It returned the case to his court for further proceedings.Bryan Hatchell, a Reynolds American spokesman, said the company is considering its options, including an appeal.""Several alternative grounds for dismissing the case exist, and we will ask the district court to dismiss the case again on those grounds,"" he said. ""We continue to believe that the lawsuit is entirely baseless in both fact and law."" NO CARTE BLANCHE As described by the 2nd Circuit, the alleged scheme began with the smuggling of illegal narcotics into Europe by Colombian and Russian crime groups, with euro-denominated proceeds from the sale of those drugs then ""laundered"" by money brokers.Importers would allegedly use these proceeds later to buy RJ Reynolds cigarettes via wholesalers, with payments and shipments shielded from government scrutiny. Brokers using funds derived from the importers would then allegedly repeat the cycle.The EU accused the RJ Reynolds entities of essentially directing the scheme from the United States, using U.S. mails and wires and frequent travel by employees to Colombia. In dismissing the case, Garaufis said RICO did not apply because the scheme was centered on foreign crime groups operating outside the country.Leval, however, said that standard could create ""illogical"" results, such as immunizing people from RICO liability for murders and kidnappings in the United States simply because they were done in conjunction with a foreign enterprise.""Surely the presumption against extraterritorial application of United States laws does not command giving foreigners carte blanche to violate the laws of the United States in the United States,"" he wrote.""We conclude that RICO applies extraterritorially if, and only if, liability or guilt could attach to extraterritorial conduct under the relevant RICO predicate,"" Leval added.The 2nd Circuit took more than two years to decide the case, having heard oral arguments on Feb. 24, 2012.John Halloran, a lawyer for the EU countries, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In afternoon trading, Reynolds American shares were down 62 cents at $54.39 on the New York Stock Exchange.The case is European Community v.

1,"  NEW YORK, April 23 A U.S. appeals court has revived a lawsuit by 26 European countries that accused R.J. Reynolds Tobacco and related entities of running a global money-laundering scheme with organized crime groups.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said a lower court judge erred in concluding that a U.S. anti-racketeering law, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) statute, cannot apply to foreign enterprises or to conduct outside the United States.""With respect to a number of offenses that constitute predicates for RICO liability and are alleged in this case, Congress has clearly manifested an intent that they apply extraterritorially,"" Circuit Judge Pierre Leval wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel. ""As to the other alleged offenses, the complaint alleges sufficiently important domestic activity to come within RICO's coverage."" Several defendants were named, including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco's parent Reynolds American Inc. The 2nd Circuit sent the case back to the lower court for further proceedings.

2,"   By Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Reynolds American Inc (RAI.N) is in active discussions to buy Lorillard Inc LO.N in a complicated, three-way transaction that could see British American Tobacco PLC (BATS.L) take a major role to back a potential merger, according to people familiar with the matter.The proposed deal, which is in late stage talks, would unite the second- and third-largest U.S. tobacco companies that have a combined market value of nearly $55 billion, putting brands such as Reynolds' Camel and Lorillard's Newport under one roof.The companies are working to finalize an agreement in as soon as a matter of weeks but the talks will likely take longer given the complex structure, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.Reynolds, in which British American Tobacco (BAT) has a 42 percent stake, has a market capitalization of $32 billion after its shares rose 4.4 percent Wednesday on news of the merger talks. Shares of Lorillard jumped more than 10 percent, giving it a market capitalization of $22.7 billion.Because Reynolds plans to use its own stock to pay for part of the Lorillard deal, BAT's holding in Reynolds would decrease if the merger goes through.One option is for BAT to help finance Reynolds' bid so it would keep its ownership in the combined company at current levels, one person said. BAT's involvement could also take different forms, another person added. Reynolds, Lorillard and BAT are working with financial advisers on the proposed deal and talks have been underway for months, the people said, cautioning that there are many moving pieces and discussions could still fall apart.A merger between Reynolds and Lorillard would create a formidable rival to Marlboro cigarette maker Altria Group Inc (MO.N), the market leader with a roughly 50 percent share of the U.S. tobacco industry.Reynolds and Lorillard have a market share of 27 percent and 15 percent, respectively, and the proposed combination would face substantial antitrust issues. The companies are hammering out details of potential divestitures in order to address regulatory concerns, according to the people familiar with the matter.All the people asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak with the media. Representatives for Reynolds and BAT declined to comment. Lorillard could not be immediately reached for comment.Buying Lorillard would boost Reynolds' position in the fast-growing electronic cigarettes market at a time when U.S. tobacco companies are grappling with declining sales due to government regulation. Lorillard's blu product is the leading e-cigarette brand, with a U.S. market share of around 50 percent. E-cigarettes are crucial to the three major U.S. tobacco companies, which have bought or developed their own brands in recent years. Sales of the electronic products in the U.S. are expected to outpace traditional cigarettes by 2020.Reynolds has its own e-cigarette product called Vuse, which is currently sold in only two U.S. states, and is in the process of rolling out nationwide. Altria Group has the MarkTen brand and also is going nationwide.But the possibility of a tie-up between Reynolds and Lorillard has raised some eyebrows from analysts, as the Food and Drug Administration has said it is considering restricting or banning menthol cigarettes, which make up the majority of Lorillard's sales.The percentage of adult smokers in the United States fell to 19 percent in 2011 from 22.8 percent 10 years earlier, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Merger speculation involving tobacco companies has increased after the Financial Times said in March that Reynolds was exploring a bid for Lorillard. The Times of London separately reported this month BAT is exploring possible deals for either Reynolds or Lorillard.(Additional reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Tom Brown, Meredith Mazzilli and Eric Walsh)",2014-05-21,RAI,"Wed May 21, 2014 | 5:40pm EDT","Exclusive: Reynolds American, Lorillard in advanced merger talks",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-lorillard-reynolds-amricn-idUSBREA4K13A20140521?type=companyNews,0.987,0.01,0.919,0.071
3,"  WASHINGTON May 22 An acquisition of U.S. cigarette-maker Lorillard Inc by Reynolds American Inc  could face a bumpy road with antitrust regulators, experts said, with some predicting the deal could be blocked outright and others saying it could only go through with significant divestitures.The combination, which would bring Reynolds' Camel and Lorillard's Newport brands under one corporate roof, would join companies controlling 27 percent and 15 percent of the U.S. cigarette market, respectively. Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc  is the market leader with roughly 50 percent.Reynolds is in active talks to buy Lorillard in a complicated three-way transaction in which British American Tobacco could take a role, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.Among six antitrust experts surveyed by Reuters, two predicted it would be blocked, and one said it should be stopped but might survive an antitrust review because the product was cigarettes. Three said regulatory agencies would likely allow it to go through with asset sales.Beyond the market concentration in traditional cigarettes, the new company's market share in electronic-cigarettes could draw scrutiny. Lorillard's Blu currently controls about 50 percent of the market, but Reynolds plans to roll out its Vuse brand nationwide this summer. It remains unclear whether the merged company would keep both brands.E-cigarettes are crucial to the three major U.S. tobacco companies, which have bought or developed their own brands in recent years. Sales of the electronic products in the United States are expected to outpace traditional cigarettes by 2020. Still, traditional cigarettes now account for the vast majority of the industry's sales and it was not immediately clear how much regulators would focus on the emerging technology.""That's a significant increase in concentration in an already highly concentrated market. I don't see how that gets approved,"" said David Smutny, a veteran of the Justice Department who is now at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP.While the government is trying to discourage smoking, regulators may not ignore the possible impact of the deal on cigarette prices. ""Are the FTC or (Justice Department) going to let a merger go through that will result in higher prices because they think consumption of the product should be reduced?"" said Bernard Nigro, an antitrust expert at law firm Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP. ""I would be surprised if that were the outcome.""Others said there would be little public outcry about the potential for higher cigarette prices. ""There's not a League of Addicted Smokers who are going to yell bloody murder about this,"" said one Justice Department veteran, Peter Carstensen, now at the University of Wisconsin Law School. He said that previously he would have expected a deal involving such large market shares to be shot down quickly, but that deals such as the settlement that allowed the American Airlines merger have made him think that a Lorillard-Reynolds deal might have a chance with regulators.Analysts at Morningstar similarly argued that price would loom as less of a factor than in other industries.Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said the chances are high, 80 percent, that the deal would occur, but that it might require Reynolds to divest brands, including Kool, Winston and Salem, which it already could be ""shopping"".The 2004 merger of B.A.T's U.S. business with R.J. Reynolds, flew through regulatory scrutiny relatively unscathed.Beyond the health concerns associated with cigarettes in general, Lorillard has come under particular scrutiny because it now accounts for 65 percent of the U.S. menthol market, which could come under pressure from new regulations in the coming years.

4,"   By Jilian Mincer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK When Lorillard Inc bought the blu eCigs brand two years ago, the electronic cigarette had a 10 percent share of a tiny U.S. market, generating about $50 million in sales. It was available in only 12,000 retail outlets and over the Internet. Today, the U.S. tobacco company’s marketing and distribution muscle, including its use of frequent TV commercials and concert sponsorships, has taken blu into 149,000 outlets and driven its U.S. market share to about 47 percent. Annual sales have quadrupled to more than $200 million.The turbo-charged growth means that blu and Lorillard's British SKYCIG e-cigarette brand may be the assets with the sweetest potential for Reynolds American Inc as it holds talks over a deal to acquire its U.S. rival. Both brands would complement Reynolds' new Vuse e-cigarettes brand, due to go national this summer, and vault the combined company into an undisputed leadership position in the young market.And the gains in e-cigarette sales may have only just begun. Some Wall Street analysts see e-cigarettes and other “vapor products” overtaking traditional tobacco sales within six years.""Acquisition of Lorillard would give Reynolds a distinct advantage in the e-cig market,"" said Steve Marascia, Director of Research at Capitol Securities Management. Reuters reported last week that the companies were in late- stage talks that would combine the second and third-largest U.S. tobacco companies, according to people familiar with the matter. A combination of Lorillard and Reynolds, which is 42 percent owned by British American Tobacco, would create a formidable rival to Altria Group Inc, which owns the Marlboro brand and controls about 50 percent of the traditional cigarette market in the U.S.E-cigarettes are slim, reusable, metal tube devices containing nicotine-laced liquids that come in exotic flavors. When users puff, the nicotine is heated and released as a vapor containing no tar, unlike conventional cigarette smoke. Taking the lead position in e-cigarettes is appealing but given the market’s nascent nature, it is not a sure bet. New brands could easily grab market share, and there have been signs that other vaping products, including larger ""tank""-based devices, may be gaining popularity. These products are typically less expensive to use, and can provide a stronger nicotine delivery. ""I think it's more of a hedge,"" said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham in reference to the e-cigarettes part of any Lorillard acquisition. ""But if e-cigs take off, it will be the future, and they'll be glad they invested.""MORE THAN MENTHOL      Lorillard's popular Newport menthol cigarette brand, whose sales have held steady even as cigarette smoking in the United States has declined, is likely to be the immediate driver of any deal. Newport accounts for 37 percent of the U.S. menthol market and 12.5 percent of overall cigarette sales.  U.S. sales of conventional cigarettes are forecast to drop  to $15.3 billion in 2023 from $28.3 billion in 2013, according to a recent report from Wells Fargo Securities. In contrast, it sees revenue from e-cigarettes and other vapor devices growing to $24 billion by 2023 from $1.5 billion last year. Altria is also getting into the game, though it only introduced its MarkTen brand in August 2013 in Indiana. It plans a nationwide rollout next month.Lorillard bought blu two years ago from founder Jason Healy and his investors for $135 million. A year later, it paid $49 million for SKYCIG, now the leading e-cigarette in Britain.   The deals were part of a strategy by Lorillard CEO Murray Kessler to expand its offerings beyond conventional cigarettes. Formerly at Altria, he helped build that company's Skoal and Copenhagen into two of the best-selling smokeless, or chewing tobacco, brands. Morningstar analyst Gorham estimates blu is currently worth $500 million to $1 billion, though it may account for a higher number in any deal for Lorillard, whose overall market value is currently about $22 billion.  ""Because Big Tobacco really wants a piece of the action, I could be low-balling it,"" he said.Since the vapor market is still in its early stages, it is difficult to anticipate how it may evolve. Regulatory changes could have a big impact. In April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued proposed rules that would ban sale of e-cigarettes to anyone under 18 and require companies to list ingredients. But the rules so far would not restrict flavored products, online sales or advertising. The big tobacco companies are expected to be in a much better position than their dozens of smaller rivals to handle any new oversight thanks to their long experience dealing with regulators and battling anti-tobacco lawsuits.They may also have an upper hand in assuring quality control as the industry comes under stepped-up scrutiny after recent horror stories about the dangers of accidental poisoning from some ingredients on the market.    ""The big three tobacco guys will be the big three e-cigarette companies because of their resources, relationship with distributors and ability to comply with the FDA faster than competitors,"" RBC Capital Markets LLC analyst Nik Modi said, referring to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

5,"   By Olivia Oran and Soyoung Kim | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Imperial Tobacco Group Plc IMT.L is evaluating a deal for assets likely to be divested from Reynolds American Inc (RAI.N) and Lorillard Inc LO.N if the two U.S. tobacco companies proceed with a proposed combination, according to people familiar with the matter.Reynolds and Lorillard are in advanced talks about a deal that would merge the No.2 and No.3 U.S. cigarette makers, Reuters previously reported. The companies have discussed divesting some brands to address potential antitrust concerns. U.K.-based Imperial, the world's fourth-largest tobacco group that is known for Gauloises and Davidoff cigarettes, has held discussions about acquiring these brands and is working with advisers to study the deal, the people said.The scope of the potential divestiture is expected to be significant, and the parties may try to line up a buyer for these assets before finalizing a merger, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives for Reynolds, Lorillard and Imperial did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Some analysts have said a potential divestiture could top $5 billion and could include Reynolds brands like Kool and Salem. Purchasing sizable assets from the U.S. tobacco makers would give Imperial additional scale in a competitive and declining U.S. tobacco market, roughly half of which is controlled by Marlboro cigarette maker Altria Group Inc (MO.N). Reynolds, which is 42 percent owned by British American Tobacco PLC (BATS.L), and Lorillard have a market share of 27 percent and 15 percent, respectively. The proposed combination would face substantial regulatory issues.Having an agreement in place to divest assets would be crucial to success of a deal, which is already complicated with multiple parties and various moving pieces. British American Tobacco is part of the discussions and is expected to play a major role in backing any merger, such as helping finance Reynolds' bid for Lorillard, Reuters reported last month.While talks have been going on for months and progressed to advanced stages, they could fall apart any time, given the complexity, people familiar with the matter have said.

7,"  (Adds Altria comment, Reynolds and Lorillard not immediately available for comment)By Jonathan StempelNEW YORK, June 18 A federal judge said on Wednesday New York City may prevent retailers from offering discounts on cigarettes and other tobacco products, rejecting an industry effort to halt enforcement of a law designed to curb tobacco purchases.U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa in Manhattan said the city may block stores from selling the products at below list price, whether by running sales, redeeming coupons, offering bulk discounts or providing free lighters or other non-tobacco products with purchases.Industry trade groups, as well as cigarette makers, including Philip Morris parent Altria Group Inc, Reynolds American Inc and Lorillard Inc, complained that the limits violated their free speech rights and were pre-empted by other federal and state laws.The limits on discounts were part of a sweeping law signed last November by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg as part of an effort to dissuade people from smoking. Other changes included raising the minimum legal age to buy tobacco to 21 from 18, setting a minimum $10.50 price for a pack of cigarettes, boosting penalties for illegal tobacco sales and increasing enforcement against non-payment of excise taxes.In upholding the limits on discounts, Griesa said pricing restrictions ""designed to discourage consumption of a potentially harmful product"" were constitutional so long as retailers could still provide ""truthful, non-misleading information"" to consumers.""The ordinance only regulates an economic transaction - the sale of tobacco products below the listed price,"" he wrote. ""It does not restrict the dissemination of pricing information and thus, it does not violate the First Amendment."" Altria spokesman Brian May said: ""We disagree with the court's decision, and are considering our appellate options.""Spokesmen for Reynolds American and Lorillard, as well as lawyers for both companies, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ""This is a huge victory for the city's comprehensive efforts to reduce tobacco usage,"" Nicholas Ciappetta, a senior lawyer for the city, said in a statement.Bloomberg's more than decade-old campaign to ban smoking in various public and private places and to discourage New Yorkers from smoking altogether has become a blueprint for other cities.The City Council has estimated that the enacted changes have helped reduce smoking rates in the city by nearly one-third for adults and roughly one-half for children.Bloomberg left office 5-1/2 months ago, after serving 12 years as mayor.The case is National Association of Tobacco Outlets Inc et al v.

10,"  * BAT expects to buy Reynolds shares to keep current stake* Imperial lining up about $7 bln to buy some brands-source* Reynolds, Lorillard marriage seen making $500 mln savings* Waning U.S. litigation risk seen aiding deals   (Adds background on litigation, share activity)By Martinne Geller and Kate HoltonLONDON, July 11 U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc is in talks to acquire rival Lorillard Inc  in a multi-billion dollar deal that would reshape one of the world's biggest and most profitable tobacco markets, the companies said on Friday.A deal would also involve the sale of some brands to Britain's Imperial Tobacco Group to address potential antitrust concerns, as well as the purchase of more shares in Reynolds by British American Tobacco (BATS), its largest shareholder.In a statement confirming what people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters, Reynolds, No.2 player in the United States with brands including Camel and Pall Mall, said the talks were consistent with its strategy of weighing options that would help boost shareholder value.Buying Lorillard, which had a stock market value of $22.9 billion on Thursday, would give Reynolds the leading U.S. menthol cigarette Newport and its leading e-cigarette blu. Analysts say the combination could also generate $500 million in annual cost savings, helping the No.2 and No.3 U.S. players compete with Marlboro maker and No.1 Altria Group Inc  in a market where sales volume is falling about 4 percent a year as more Americans quit smoking.Despite the decline, the U.S. remains the biggest tobacco market in the world after China and the most profitable.""Reynolds is getting both a fantastic brand in Newport and strong intellectual property in the e-cig category,"" said analyst Philip Gorham at research firm Morningstar. ""It's a good deal strategically, we just need to know what they're paying. If they pay a premium to today's price, it's going to be on the rich end of historical deals.""Historically, he said tobacco deals have fetched an average enterprise value (equity plus debt) of about 12 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, which is about where Lorillard's stock was trading on Friday, up 4.8 percent in New York. SUPPORTING THE DEAL BAT, which owns 42 percent of Reynolds, said that if the deal proceeds, it would expect to support it by buying more shares in Reynolds with the aim of maintaining its current stake, which is the company's only exposure to the U.S. market. Over the last 50 years, the United States has seen several waves of lawsuits against tobacco firms, including complaints by individuals, class action suits and a massive racketeering case. Cases have concerned the industry's negligence, disclosure of health risks and advertising practices.Litigation risks contributed to the 2008 separation of Altria and Philip Morris International, which is now the world No.1 selling Marlboros everywhere except the United States. But analysts say the litigation risk has waned, so there is now more openness to trade there.""A lot of the more extreme class action suits haven't really made the progress people thought they might,"" said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo, who questioned whether by buying into the United States, Imperial would be taking on additional risk.""I'd have thought that given Imperial's leverage in the negotiations, they will be able to insist that they don't,"" he said.Imperial, known for its Gauloises and Davidoff cigarettes, said it was in talks with Reynolds and Lorillard about buying certain assets they might sell but saw no guarantee the proposed deal would come off.A source familiar with the situation said Imperial was lining up about $7 billion to finance the potential purchase of brands such as Kool and Salem, which would ease antitrust concerns thrown up by a Reynolds-Lorillard combination.Reynolds, Lorillard and BAT said there were no assurances a deal will be reached. They added that unless circumstances dictate otherwise, they did not intend to comment further.Imperial shares closed up 3 percent at 2,740 pence, while BAT shares ended up 0.2 percent.

Menthol cigarettes have roughly a 28 percent market share in the United States, according to market research firm Euromonitor International. Experts say the mint-flavored additive enjoys disproportionate popularity among minorities, especially African-Americans, and young people.Reynolds is in talks to acquire Lorillard, which has a market capitalization of $22.9 billion, in a deal that would reshape one of the world's most profitable tobacco markets. Adding Newport to its product lineup would allow Reynolds, maker of Camel cigarettes, to broaden its reach among minority and younger smokers. Menthol may reduce the irritation and harshness of smoking when used in cigarettes, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The category is declining but at a slower rate than nonmenthol cigarettes. According to a report by Cowen & Co., menthol sales volumes have fallen at 2 percent annually for the last 10 years compared to a 4 percent decline for nonmenthol cigarettes.  Still, menthols face risks as the FDA considers restrictions on the substance, which is regulated in medical products but not in cigarettes. The agency last year released a preliminary review that said that a majority of African-American smokers use menthol cigarettes. Menthols were also associated with lower socioeconomic status, according to the FDA review of available studies.Those studies showed that menthol in cigarettes was likely associated with reduced success in quitting smoking, especially among African-Americans, the review said. The agency declined to comment Friday on the timing of any possible regulatory actions.A separate study conducted by Stanford University School of Medicine researchers in 2011 found that there were more ads for menthol cigarettes at licensed tobacco retailers near high schools with a greater proportion of African-American students. A ban on menthol cigarettes would ""eliminate concomitant advertising that targets young people and some racial and ethnic groups,"" said Lisa Henriksen, senior research analyst at the Stanford Prevention Research Center. She added that tobacco companies have been targeting African-Americans with advertising for menthol cigarettes since the 1960s.Lorillard and Reynolds did not return phone calls requesting comment. Lorillard says on its site that the company ""believes that the best available scientific evidence does not show that menthol cigarettes are more harmful than non-menthol cigarettes and that Americans have a right to make a personal choice to use any legal product.""In a response to the FDA review last year, the company disputed that its marketing was disproportionately aimed at minorities. ""For adults who choose to smoke, Lorillard's marketing seeks to persuade those smokers to choose a Lorillard brand,"" the company said.  Roughly 85 percent of Lorillard's $6.9 billion in sales last year came from the Newport brand. The acquisition talks indicate that both companies view the regulatory risk from FDA as lower today than it was a year ago, said Vivien Azer, director and senior research analyst at Cowen & Co. ""We do not expect an outright ban but would not be surprised to see incremental regulation down the road,"" she added.Still, big bets on menthol may produce limited returns in the long run.

16,"   By David Ingram and Jessica Dye | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Smoking-related lawsuits against U.S. tobacco giants are leveling off, making it more likely that a merger between rivals Reynolds American Inc and Lorillard Inc will go through, analysts who follow the industry said.The two cigarette makers, which are in talks for a multi-billion-dollar deal, face thousands of suits, but the impact has not been as dramatic as was expected a decade ago, and trials have given investors an idea of what the companies will pay. Antismoking campaigns have also made it more difficult for smokers and government enforcers to argue that companies were deceitful.Supporting the Lorillard-Reynolds deal is ""a new mood of optimism within U.S. Big Tobacco on the litigation landscape,"" UK-based analysts at the investment firm Jefferies Group said in a note on June 30, adding that the situation still looked risky.Lawsuits complicate what a company is worth, increasing chances an acquiring company will overpay in a deal. Tobacco companies that have an idea what they are apt to pay smokers who have sued may be seen as better investments.A deal between Reynolds and Lorillard, the No. 2 and No. 3 U.S. players, would reshape one of the world's biggest and most profitable tobacco markets. Lorillard makes Newport, the top U.S. menthol cigarette, and leading e-cigarette blu.The brighter legal picture dates to 2006, when the Florida Supreme Court set aside an eye-popping $145 billion verdict against the biggest tobacco companies. The ruling in Engle v. Liggett Group left smokers to pursue cases one at a time, alleging that companies concealed the dangers of smoking. Since 2011, Reynolds has won roughly half the 100 cases that went to trial as part of what has become known as the Engle litigation and other smoking-related cases, the company said in a securities filing in April. Lorillard said it has won about a quarter of its Engle-related trials. No new Engle-related cases were permitted in Florida after January 2008, and few class action suits have been brought in other states. 'COMFORTABLE' WITH LIABILITY Based on Reynolds' securities filings, Jefferies Group estimated aggregate liabilities from the Engle cases at $25 billion or less for the whole U.S. tobacco industry, and called it a ""small number"" relative to the industry's worth.""If you're a U.S. tobacco investor, you're probably comfortable with this, and it's in the stock price to some extent,"" said Jefferies equity analyst Martin Deboo.RBC Capital Markets said in a note in May that the U.S. tobacco industry was ripe for consolidation based in part on a ""stable litigation environment."" Neither Reynolds nor Lorillard has offered a public estimate of its future liability. The companies did not respond to requests on Friday to elaborate on that and its impact on a merger.The majority of U.S. lawsuits against tobacco companies are in Florida, where a jury in 2000 awarded smokers the $145 billion in punitive damages. The state's high court later said the smokers could not sue as a group but could use findings from the Engle class action about the dangers of smoking. Through the first quarter of 2014, Reynolds said in a securities filing that it faced 5,000 Engle suits, down from 7,700 in December 2009. The ones that did not go to trial were settled or dismissed. Lorillard said it faced 4,000 as of this year. Some suits target multiple companies. DECLINE OF THE DECEPTION DEFENSE When juries find against the tobacco defendants, the awards to smokers can be substantial. Lorillard paid $79 million last year to resolve one suit from the family of a longtime smoker who died of lung cancer. Liggett Group, a unit of Vector Group Ltd, said last year it would pay $110 million to settle 4,900 suits.The Florida cases may represent the ""last big chunk"" of smoking cases, said Sergio Campos, a professor at the University of Miami School of Law.But the mix of courtroom wins and losses has eased fears that litigation could force the companies out of business. Tobacco education has improved since litigation started decades ago, making it difficult for plaintiffs to claim they could not have known about cigarettes' addictive and disease-causing properties, he said.""At some point, you get your hands around (the litigation), you know it won't metastasize or grow anymore, and it frees you up to explore this kind of deal,"" Campos said.

17,"   By Anjali Athavaley and Siddharth Cavale  Reynolds American Inc's proposed $25 billion acquisition of smaller rival Lorillard Inc shows how the tobacco company is placing its bets on the market for menthols even as a growing number of smokers opt for e-cigarettes.With the deal, Reynolds American picks up Newport menthol cigarettes, one of the few U.S. brands that is gaining share in a shrinking market. At the same time, Reynolds is giving up blu - the top-seller in the e-cigarette market seen by many as the tobacco industry's future - to Britain's Imperial Tobacco Group.As part of the deal, Imperial will buy Reynolds' Salem, Winston and KOOL and Lorillard's Maverick brands in a move meant to ease potential antitrust concerns. Experts say that still may not satisfy regulators. Sources familiar with the transaction said gaining the blu brand made the deal more attractive to Imperial. While cigarette sales volume has been falling about 4 percent a year, e-cigarette sales have been booming. Reynolds sells its own e-cigarettes under the Vuse brand but controls less than 5 percent of the market, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.But Reynolds' chief executive officer, Susan Cameron, says Vuse has a ""superior technology"" that will make it a strong contender in the e-cigarette market. The company, which started selling Vuse roughly a year ago in Colorado and Utah, is rolling out the product nationwide this quarter. Meanwhile, Reynolds' purchase of Lorillard's Newport brand gives the company a stronger presence in the market for menthol cigarettes. Menthols now make up 31.4 percent of the total market compared with 26 percent in 2002, according to Morningstar.    ""The e-cigarette category is very small today,"" said Cameron. ""It's growing and consumers are interested in it, but this transaction is really about adding Newport to our portfolio.""Menthol is a mint-flavored additive that may reduce the irritation and harshness of smoking when used in cigarettes, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Experts say menthols have disproportionate popularity among young people, lower-income smokers and African-Americans. The FDA last year released a preliminary review that said that a majority of African-American smokers use menthol cigarettes. Menthols were also associated with lower socioeconomic status, according to the FDA review of available studies. But the deal shows that Reynolds isn't banking on significant regulation of menthols by the FDA, which regulates the substance in medical products but not in cigarettes. The agency is conducting its own studies on the topic and has said it would consider restricting the use of menthols.In an interview, Lorillard’s CEO, Murray Kessler, said both companies are confident there is no justification for regulating menthol cigarettes differently than nonmenthols.  Analysts have also said that smoking-related lawsuits are leveling off in the United States, making it a ripe time for consolidation in the industry. ""I think the industry believes the litigation environment is manageable and has certainly improved over the last decade,"" said Kessler.Still, health advocates have raised concerns that the proposed acquisition would bring together two companies they say have a history of marketing to children and minorities. ""A bigger tobacco company is not better for public health,"" said Lisa Henrikson, a senior research scientist at Stanford Prevention Research Center, part of the Stanford University School of Medicine. Lorillard and Reynolds declined to comment. The companies also downplayed concerns that the deal wouldn't pass antitrust scrutiny. The planned divestitures could be just a starting point, with more offered if regulators balk at allowing the deal, said Andre Barlow, an antitrust expert with Doyle, Barlow & Mazard Pllc. ""We are very confident we will close this in the first half of 2015,"" Cameron said.     Cameron will continue to be president and CEO of Reynolds, the company said. Kessler will join RAI’s board after the closing of the transaction.DEAL DETAILS    Reynolds, whose brands include Camel and Pall Mall, offered $68.88 per Lorillard share, representing a premium of 2.5 percent to Lorillard's Monday close.Lorillard's shares, which have risen about 37 percent since reports of the deal first surfaced in February, were down 7.5 percent at $62.19 on Tuesday.

18,"   By Jilian Mincer, Martinne Geller and Anjuli Davies | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON When Imperial Tobacco Group Plc agreed Tuesday to buy a group of brands from Reynolds American Inc and Lorillard Inc as part of their merger, the British company insisted the assets include Lorillard's blu e-cigarette unit.The brand gives Imperial, which will become the third-largest U.S. tobacco company overall, a big lead in the new and fast-growing U.S. electronic cigarette market where it now accounts for about 47 percent of market share.    E-cigarettes are considered a crucial business for big tobacco companies, which have bought or developed their own brands in recent years to offset shrinking sales of conventional tobacco cigarettes.

19,"  (recasts first paragraph, adds details on e-cigs)     By Jilian Mincer, Martinne Geller and Anjuli Davies     NEW YORK/LONDON, July 15 When Imperial Tobacco Group Plc agreed Tuesday to buy a group of brands from Reynolds American Inc and Lorillard Inc as part of their merger, the British company insisted the assets include Lorillard's blu e-cigarette unit.     The brand gives Imperial, which will become the third-largest U.S. tobacco company overall, a big lead in the new and fast-growing U.S. electronic cigarette market where it now accounts for about 47 percent of market share.     E-cigarettes are considered a crucial business for big tobacco companies, which have bought or developed their own brands in recent years to offset shrinking sales of conventional tobacco cigarettes.      Imperial, which already had an e-cigarette product called Puritane, hopes to build on blu's strong U.S. foothold worldwide, said Chief Executive Alison Cooper.

At the same time, Reynolds is giving up blu - the top-seller in the e-cigarette market seen by many as the tobacco industry's future - to Britain's Imperial Tobacco Group.As part of the deal, Imperial will buy Reynolds' Salem, Winston and KOOL and Lorillard's Maverick brands in a move meant to ease potential antitrust concerns. Experts say that still may not satisfy regulators.Sources familiar with the transaction said gaining the blu brand made the deal more attractive to Imperial. While cigarette sales volume has been falling about 4 percent a year, e-cigarette sales have been booming. Reynolds sells its own e-cigarettes under the Vuse brand but controls less than 5 percent of the market, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.But Reynolds' chief executive officer, Susan Cameron, says Vuse has a ""superior technology"" that will make it a strong contender in the e-cigarette market. The company, which started selling Vuse roughly a year ago in Colorado and Utah, is rolling out the product nationwide this quarter.Meanwhile, Reynolds' purchase of Lorillard's Newport brand gives the company a stronger presence in the market for menthol cigarettes. Menthols now make up 31.4 percent of the total market compared with 26 percent in 2002, according to Morningstar.""The e-cigarette category is very small today,"" said Cameron. ""It's growing and consumers are interested in it, but this transaction is really about adding Newport to our portfolio.""Menthol is a mint-flavored additive that may reduce the irritation and harshness of smoking when used in cigarettes, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Experts say menthols have disproportionate popularity among young people, lower-income smokers and African-Americans. The FDA last year released a preliminary review that said that a majority of African-American smokers use menthol cigarettes. Menthols were also associated with lower socioeconomic status, according to the FDA review of available studies.But the deal shows that Reynolds isn't banking on significant regulation of menthols by the FDA, which regulates the substance in medical products but not in cigarettes. The agency is conducting its own studies on the topic and has said it would consider restricting the use of menthols.In an interview, Lorillard's CEO, Murray Kessler, said both companies are confident there is no justification for regulating menthol cigarettes differently than nonmenthols.Analysts have also said that smoking-related lawsuits are leveling off in the United States, making it a ripe time for consolidation in the industry.""I think the industry believes the litigation environment is manageable and has certainly improved over the last decade,"" said Kessler.Still, health advocates have raised concerns that the proposed acquisition would bring together two companies they say have a history of marketing to children and minorities. ""A bigger tobacco company is not better for public health,"" said Lisa Henrikson, a senior research scientist at Stanford Prevention Research Center, part of the Stanford University School of Medicine.Lorillard and Reynolds declined to comment.The companies also downplayed concerns that the deal wouldn't pass antitrust scrutiny. The planned divestitures could be just a starting point, with more offered if regulators balk at allowing the deal, said Andre Barlow, an antitrust expert with Doyle, Barlow & Mazard Pllc.""We are very confident we will close this in the first half of 2015,"" Cameron said.Cameron will continue to be president and CEO of Reynolds, the company said. Kessler will join RAI's board after the closing of the transaction. DEAL DETAILS Reynolds, whose brands include Camel and Pall Mall, offered $68.88 per Lorillard share, representing a premium of 2.5 percent to Lorillard's Monday close.Lorillard's shares, which have risen about 37 percent since reports of the deal first surfaced in February, were down 7.5 percent at $62.19 on Tuesday.Reynolds' shares were down 4 percent at $60.61.

22,"  By Jilian Mincer, Anjali Athavaley and Anjuli Davies     NEW YORK/LONDON, July 15 Reynolds American Inc  had no choice but to sell Lorillard Inc's  top-selling blu electronic cigarettes brand after Britain's Imperial Tobacco Group Plc insisted it be part of a wider portfolio of assets it is buying, a source familiar with the transaction said.      The U.S. companies said on Tuesday that they were selling blu and a group of traditional cigarette brands to Imperial to ease antitrust concerns about Reynolds' proposed $27.4 billion acquisition of Lorillard.     Keeping blu would have given Lorillard and Reynolds more than 50 percent of the tiny but crucial U.S. e-cigarette market, further complicating a deal that was already expected to face heavy antitrust scrutiny.     ""I think the widespread perception is if the deal stood as it was, it would have been off,"" said Steve Marascia, director of research at Capitol Securities Management.          Imperial will also acquire Reynolds' Kool, Salem and Winston brands as well as Lorillard's Maverick. But blu was a key sweetener to bring the British company into the deal, which would make it a credible third competitor in the U.S. market.     ""It was very important for Imperial in terms of their competitiveness and their go-forward,"" Reynolds Chief Executive Officer Susan Cameron told Reuters.     Reynolds believed its newer Vuse brand was ""superior technology,"" she added.     The source said blu was part of the negotiations.      ""Imperial said they're only doing this if they get blu,"" said the source.           VUSE VS. BLU     E-cigarettes are slim, reusable, metal tube devices containing nicotine-laced liquids that come in exotic flavors. When users puff, the nicotine is heated and released as a vapor containing no tar, unlike conventional cigarette smoke.     While Vuse's market share is significantly smaller than blu's 47 percent, Reynolds is the only one of the three largest U.S. tobacco companies to make its e-cigarettes in its home turf, at a factory in Kansas.      Reynolds executives have said they believe the domestic production gives them greater oversight and control of the ingredients and manufacturing of a product that has already drawn close scrutiny from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulators.      The company, which started selling Vuse roughly a year ago in Colorado and Utah, is rolling out the product nationwide this quarter.     Reynolds expects to share e-cigarette technology with top stakeholder British American Tobacco Plc and to cooperate on next-generation tobacco products such as heat-not-burn cigarettes and vapor cigarettes, said a company spokesman.     ""This agreement with BAT holds great promise for global growth in those categories and will enhance value for all shareholders,"" he said.     Keeping blu would have at least temporarily given Reynolds and Lorillard, which bought the brand two years ago, a potentially unbeatable head start in the U.S. e-cigarette market.      That market share has been contracting, however, as Reynolds and Altria Group Inc rolled out their brands nationwide.     The e-cigarette category is still evolving, said Morningstar analyst Philip Gorham.

Imperial Tobacco sank 3 percent, making it the top FTSE 100 decliner, following news that Reynolds American would buy rival Lorillard, and sell brands to the British cigarette maker to address antitrust issues.Reynolds said it would sell its Kool, Salem and Winston and Lorillard's Maverick and blu eCigs brands and other assets to Imperial Tobacco for $7.1 billion in cash.Following the announcement concerning the asset disposals, credit rating agency Fitch revised its outlook on Imperial Tobacco to negative from stable.""Fitch views positively the enlargement of Imperial's U.S. operations but at the same time notes that failure to enhance the cash flow generation and profit growth capability of its core European business would seriously impair credit metrics,"" Fitch said. Markets were also hit by comments from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen to a Senate committee to the effect that the U.S. economic recovery is incomplete, justifying a loose monetary policy for the foreseeable future.Investors had been expecting a more upbeat assessment on the economy, strategists said.""While in the short term it will be seen as a positive that the Federal Reserve don't have to raise interest rates, we do know that underlying strength in the U.S. economy is important for companies and for profitability growth, and investors are reacting,"" said Henk Potts, equity strategist at Barclays.

They recovered towards the end of the month when the BoE imposed measures aimed at curbing house prices that turned out to be more lenient than the builders had feared.Carney said on Tuesday the central bank's forward guidance was intended to signal how interest rates might change over the medium term, not pinpoint the timing of a first hike.

24,"   By Martinne Geller | LONDON  LONDON Imperial Tobacco Group Plc IMT.L plans to buy the leading U.S. e-cigarette brand blu as part of its $7.1 billion acquisition of U.S. cigarette brands, being sold as part of Reynolds American Inc's (RAI.N) $27.4 billion purchase of Lorillard Inc LO.N. Imperial's purchase, meant to address potential antitrust objections to the marriage of the United States' No. 2 and No. 3 tobacco firms, also includes Maverick, Salem as well as the international and U.S. rights to blu e-cigarettes, which control nearly half of the U.S. e-cigarette market.Analysts had not expected the blu brand to be part of Imperial's haul from the deal, plans for which were first reported by Reuters in May.""Blu was probably the sweetener that persuaded them to pick up what can probably most politely be described as third-tier brands,"" said Philip Gorham, an analyst with research firm Morningstar.After adjusting for the present value of tax benefits, expected at $1.5 billion, Imperial said the net price of $5.6 billion implied a multiple of 6.9 times the brands' core earnings or EBITDA. This was ""very much at the low end"" of multiples for tobacco deals, said Imperial Chief Executive Officer Alison Cooper on a conference call.""It's a very good deal,"" Cooper said, noting it would take Imperial from having only 3 percent of the U.S. market with its USA Gold brand to 10 percent, transforming Imperial ""from a distant No. 5 to a significant No. 3."" By contrast, Reynolds, maker of Camel cigarettes, is buying Newport-maker Lorillard for $27.4 billion, or about 13 times 2013 core earnings.  Imperial will be indemnified against any historic product liabilities, potentially an important factor given past litigation against cigarette makers. ""We're buying assets, not companies,"" said Chief Financial Officer Oliver Tant. There has also been speculation that Imperial itself could be a takeover target for the likes of British American Tobacco Plc (BATS.L) and Japan Tobacco Inc (2914.T) in a consolidation of the global tobacco industry. Yet Imperial's Cooper said she thought Reynolds' purchase of Lorillard was very specific to the U.S. market.""It's probably not translatable to anything more global,"" Cooper said.

25,"  (Repeat for additional subscribers)July 15 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings has affirmed British American Tobacco  p.l.c.'s (BAT) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured rating  at 'A-'. The Short-term IDR has also been affirmed at 'F2'. The Outlook is  Stable.In addition, the senior unsecured long-term rating of debt issued by BAT's  subsidiaries, British American Tobacco Holdings (The Netherlands) B.V., B.A.T.  International Finance p.l.c. and B.A.T. Capital Corporation, has been affirmed  at 'A-'. The short-term debt rating has been affirmed at 'F2'.The affirmation follows BAT's announcement that it will contribute USD4.7bn  (GBP2.7bn) capital to funding the acquisition by its associate Reynolds American  Inc (RAI) of rival US player Lorillard Inc. through a cash and equity offer. BAT  will in turn raise this from internal resources and borrowings, which Fitch  believes will keep leverage, through to at least end-2015, at a level well  beyond the maximum compatible with BAT's 'A-' rating. However, the impact of  higher leverage is, in Fitch's view, sufficiently mitigated by BAT's decision to  suspend its share buyback programme with effect from end July-2014 and by the  future benefits of a strengthened RAI, in which BAT has a 42% stake.KEY RATING DRIVERS Stronger US AssociateThe transaction will transform the US tobacco market by consolidating the number  two and number three players in the industry into a more robust competitor to  the strong leader Altria, Inc (BBB+/Stable). The new RAI will, after adjusting  for the asset disposal envisaged, enjoy a stronger market share of above 30%,  and a highly focused and easier to manage brand portfolio. It will also enjoy  substantial cost synergies resulting from the back-to-back divestment of  Lorillard's manufacturing, sales force and head office. BAT will indirectly  benefit from RAI's enhanced profitability through the likely maintenance of a  high dividend pay-out of 75% by its US associate. Share Buyback SuspensionThe imminent suspension of BAT's share buyback - which we assume to last until  at least end-2015 - helps BAT build sufficient headroom ahead of the transaction  and minimise the adverse effect from the planned USD4.7bn (GBP2.7bn) capital  disbursement. Post completion in 2015, this should help contain funds from  operations (FFO)-based net leverage to no more than 2013's 2.3x. Despite scope  for organic profit growth in 2014 we expect pre-completion leverage to remain  around 2.0x as a result of foreign currency headwinds. We project net leverage  should return to around 2.0x from 2016, on the assumption that the share buyback  remains suspended.Tight Rating Headroom The above mentioned leverage is beyond the level compatible with BAT's 'A-'.  This is mitigated by BAT's strong global market position in a consolidated and  highly cash-generative industry. The ratings are also supported by the group's  stable and substantial profits and cash flow from operations (2013: GBP4.1bn),  as reflected in our projection of a free cash flow margin of 5%-6% and a healthy  EBITDA margin of over 40% from 2014.Stable Business ProfileThe ratings continue to reflect BAT's position as a leading international  tobacco company, supported by the diversity of its portfolio of brands and of  the countries it operates in. BAT's superior geographical diversity, which Fitch  estimates to include over 50% of profits coming from high-growth emerging  markets, continues to enable it to protect profits through price increases and  cost rationalisation in an industry that is facing declining consumption and the  penetration of illicit trade. These dynamics have accelerated over the past 18  months, particularly in the European Union and Australia. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include:- FFO-adjusted net leverage above 2.0x on a sustained basis (FYE13: 2.3x)- FCF (adjusted for working capital swings) falling below GBP500m as a result of  litigation or dividend distributions (FY13: GBP660m)- FFO fixed charge cover under 6.0x (FYE13: 7.0x)- A deteriorating operating profile, as evidenced by impaired organic profit  growth capability,resulting from weak pricing power and lack of cost rationalisation to offset  volume contractionPositive: Fitch does not currently expect BAT to pursue financial policies  consistent with an upgrade.",2014-07-15,RAI,"Tue Jul 15, 2014 | 9:05am EDT",RPT-Fitch Affirms British American Tobacco p.l.c. at 'A-'/'F2'; Outlook Stable,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-affirms-british-american-tobacco-p-idUSFit70866020140715?type=companyNews,0.9961,0.045,0.811,0.144
26,"  (Repeat for additional subscribers)July 15 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlook on Imperial Tobacco Group PLC's (Imperial) Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to Negative from Stable and affirmed the IDR and senior unsecured rating at 'BBB'. The Short-term IDR has been affirmed at 'F3'. The senior unsecured ratings of the debt of Imperial's subsidiaries, Imperial Tobacco Finance PLC and Altadis Emisiones Financieras have also been affirmed at 'BBB'.The rating actions follow the announcement by Imperial that it intends to  acquire for USD7.1bn (GBP4.2bn) the assets that US tobacco companies Reynolds  American Inc. and Lorillard Inc. ('BBB'/Stable) will divest once they complete  the transaction they announced today. Fitch views positively the enlargement of  Imperial's US operations but at the same time notes that failure to enhance the  cash flow generation and profit growth capability of its core European business  would seriously impair credit metrics. The revision of the Outlook to Negative  reflects the combination of on-going challenges being faced by the existing  operations of Imperial and the anticipated increase of leverage resulting from  the acquisition.KEY RATING DRIVERS Stronger Operating ProfileThe acquisition will significantly enhance Imperial's US business, giving it a  number 3 position with a cigarette market share of 10% (currently 3%), a more  substantial portfolio that would be well diversified by pricing point, and a  national-reaching distribution platform. This should benefit Imperial's access  to shelf space and its negotiating power with retailers, as well as its existing  cigarette and cigar portfolio. Imperial will also acquire the number 1  e-cigarette brand in the US, blu. This will strengthen its ability to compete in  the EU e-cigarette market. Consequently, we expect Imperial's profitability and  diversification to grow and its reliance on the EU to reduce to approximately  55% of operating profits (63% in FY13).Weak EU MarketThe company's operating profile started to deteriorate in 2013 due to its  heavier-than-peer exposure to the declining EU tobacco market. Fragile consumer  spending in southern Europe and the increase in illicit trade affected  Imperial's consolidated volume performance to a point where price increases were  only just able to offset volume declines. In FY13 consolidated volumes dropped  by 7%, tobacco net revenues declined by 1% and total adjusted operating profit  grew by just 1% in organic terms. Performance in 1H14 worsened with tobacco net  revenue and adjusted operating profit down by 5% and volumes dropped by 8%  compared with 1H13. We therefore believe there is a risk that for some time  Imperial may not be able to defend its overall profits in this environment.Strategy to Tackle Existing BusinessManagement is enacting several initiatives to tackle these challenges and  strengthen the existing business which, if successful, would support Imperial's  credit risk profile. These include a stock optimisation and a cost  rationalisation programme, brand migration and working capital initiatives. The  major part of the 1H14 underperformance is deliberate and linked to the  implementation of the stock optimisation programme which will consequently  curtail FY14 profit growth. Management also forecasts cash inflows from its  working capital initiatives in FY15 and FY16. Execution Risks in Existing BusinessWhile these key initiatives are in support of Imperial's long-term goals, they  carry execution risks, especially when benefits will only start to feed through  fully in FY15, when completion of the acquisition is expected to take place.  Failure of these initiatives to deliver successful results and to support an  improvement of credit metrics ahead of the completion of the transaction could  lead to a downgrade.Moderate Risks to US StrategyAlthough the integration risk of the acquired assets in the US is not high, we  believe there could be some execution risk to Imperial's growth ambitions.  Imperial expects to improve profits and increase its market share over time. We  believe market share increases are achievable but there is a risk this could be  at the expense of price. In addition, Imperial will gain two menthol brands -  Kool and Salem in the US. Although menthol cigarettes enjoy a less severe volume  decline rate compared with traditional cigarettes, we note the on-going debate  over their possible ban. Leverage Beyond Rating GuidanceLease adjusted net debt/FFO rose in FY13 to 4.1x and Fitch projects leverage  could peak at above 4.5x in FY15 (at closing of acquisition) before reducing  only to approximately 3.7x in FY17, a level still above the threshold compatible  for the 'BBB' rating. Our net debt figure now includes an adjustment of  approximately GBP400m to cash in order to exclude cash held in countries from  which repatriation is slow or restricted, or that forms collateral. However,  should Imperial deliver the benefits of its different initiatives to enhance  cash flow generation and return to profit growth as planned over FY15 to FY17,  there is a chance that leverage will reduce more quickly and that the Outlook  will be revised back to Stable.Top Four Tobacco CompanyThe IDR continues to reflect Imperial's position as one of the four largest  global tobacco players (possibly moving from fourth to third place following the  transaction) and benefits from a portfolio of mid- to low-priced cigarette  brands and make-your-own products, which provides advantages in the high-price  environments of its core markets. This is despite it being less geographically  diversified than the bigger global players British American Tobacco (A-/Stable)  and Philip Morris International Inc (A/Stable). Imperial's 'BBB' IDR reflects  its size, brands and strength in the consolidated global tobacco industry, with  strong positions in the cash-generative UK, German and French markets. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative (Downgrade to BBB-): Future developments that could lead to a negative  rating action include:-Failure by existing business to maintain at least low single digit organic  revenue growth in FY15.-Failure by existing business in executing the recovery of EBITDA margin back to  2013 level (42.5%; calculated against FY13 economic revenues of GBP14.7bn) in  FY15.-FFO net leverage remaining persistently above 3.5x even after the second full  year of closing (FY17 in our projections).-Fixed charge cover ratio below 4.0x.-Annual FCF margin dropping below 3%.Positive (revision of the Outlook to Stable): Future developments that could  lead to a positive rating action include:-FFO net leverage dropping below 3.5x.-FFO fixed charge cover ratio above 4.0x.-Evidence showing the recovery of standalone business with EBITDA margins  improving and trending towards 43%.-Sustainable FCF generation of at least GBP600m over FY14 and FY15.",2014-07-15,RAI,"Tue Jul 15, 2014 | 9:01am EDT",RPT-Fitch Revises Outlook on Imperial Tobacco Group PLC to Negative; Affirms at 'BBB',http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-revises-outlook-on-imperial-tobacc-idUSFit70884320140715?type=companyNews,0.9989,0.066,0.769,0.165

29,"   By Barbara Liston | ORLANDO Fla.  ORLANDO Fla. A Florida jury has awarded the widow of a chain smoker who died of lung cancer punitive damages of more than $23 billion in her lawsuit against the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, the nation's second-biggest cigarette maker.The judgment, returned on Friday night, was the largest in Florida history in a wrongful death lawsuit filed by a single plaintiff, according to Ryan Julison, a spokesman for the woman's lawyer, Chris Chestnut.Cynthia Robinson of Florida Panhandle city of Pensacola sued the cigarette maker in 2008 over the death of her husband, Michael Johnson.Johnson, a hotel shuttle bus driver who died of lung cancer in 1996 at age 36, smoked one to three packs a day for more 20 years, starting at age 13, Chestnut said.""He couldn't quit.

31,"   By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and David Ingram | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A decision by a Florida jury to impose punitive damages of  $23.6 billion against RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company on Friday is likely to be rejected on appeal or the award reduced substantially, lawyers with expertise in jury awards said on Sunday.The award, which the cigarette maker has said it will contest, likely falls outside the boundaries for punitive damages that the U.S. Supreme Court has laid down in a series of cases, the lawyers told Reuters.RJ Reynolds is a unit of Reynolds American (RAI.N), which last week announced it would acquire rival Lorillard Inc LO.N in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $27.4 billion, including net debt.A Florida state court jury decided the award in a case brought by Cynthia Robinson of Pensacola. She is the widow of a chain smoker, Michael Johnson, who died of lung cancer in 1996 at 36. After a four-week trial and 11 hours of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict granting compensatory damages of $7.3 million to the widow and the couple's child, as well as $9.6 million to Johnson's son from a previous relationship.The same jury deliberated for another seven hours before awarding Robinson the additional sum of $23.6 billion in punitive damages, according to the verdict forms.""Nobody thinks the $23 billion is going to remain,"" said Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University and the chair of its Tobacco Products Liability Project.Because of constitutional guarantees of due process, the Supreme Court has shown a reluctance to allow punitive damages that are far out of line with compensatory damages in the same case, he said. The court's general guideline is that the ratio of punitive to compensatory damages should be below 10:1. The court precedent, though, still leaves room for a punitive award of more than $150 million, Daynard said.Punitive damages are meant to discourage companies or people from bad conduct, while compensatory damages are intended to pay victims for their actual losses.""There were all these concerns about runaway awards with regard to punitive damages,"" said Neil Vidmar, professor of law at Duke University. ""Some are saying that nine times (the compensatory damages) is the absolute limit, but actually many times, the courts have cut that down to one or two times."" In 2008, the high court cut a $2.5 billion punitive damages award against Exxon Mobil Corp for the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska to about $500 million, saying the ratio in that case should be 1:1 with compensatory damages.But there is ""no mathematical bright line rule,"" said Professor Catherine Sharkey, a tort law expert at New York University School of Law. Robinson sued R.J. Reynolds in 2008 over the death of her husband, Michael, claiming the company conspired to conceal the health dangers and addictive nature of its products. Johnson, a hotel shuttle bus driver, smoked one to three packs a day for more 20 years, starting at age 13.Robinson's lawsuit originally was part of large class-action litigation known as the ""Engle case,"" filed in 1994 against tobacco companies.A jury in that case issued a verdict in 2000 in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding $145 billion in punitive damages, which at the time was the largest such judgment in U.S. history.That award, however, was rejected in 2006 by the Florida Supreme Court, which decertified the class. It agreed with a lower court that the group was too disparate and that each consumer had smoked for different reasons. But the court said the plaintiffs could file lawsuits individually. Robinson was one of them.""I worked with juries for several decades, and I cannot put my mind on what they are doing, but the Florida jury (in awarding a huge sum) seems to be sending a message,"" said Duke's Vidmar. ""This is a statement from the jury that this was an outrageous behavior by the tobacco companies."" RJ Reynolds has paid about $114 million for 15 Engle-related cases that have been finalized, the company said in an April regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Another $180 million in damages are on appeal.Northeastern's Daynard noted that the $23 billion is close to the cost of the Reynolds-Lorillard merger deal, adding that Wall Street should be aware of the potential for more huge damage awards. ""You're going to have a lot more cases where juries could find themselves similarly outraged,"" he said. ""The reluctance of the tobacco companies to settle these cases, thinking they can handle the cases as a matter of course, may be a mistake.""The two cigarette makers face thousands of suits, but the impact has not been as dramatic as was expected a decade ago, and trials have given investors an idea of what the companies will pay.

36,"  CHICAGO Aug 25 Electronic cigarettes may be more tempting to non-smoking youths than conventional cigarettes, and once young people have tried e-cigarettes they are more inclined to give regular cigarettes a try, U.S. researchers said on Monday.A report, released by a team at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, lends evidence to the argument that electronic cigarettes encourage youth smoking.The study, based on nationally representative youth surveys, found that more than a quarter-million adolescents and teens who had never smoked used an electronic cigarette in 2013, a threefold increase from 2011.Youths who had tried e-cigarettes were nearly twice as likely to say they would try a conventional cigarette in the next year compared with those who had never tried an e-cigarette, according to the study in the journal Nicotine and Tobacco Research.E-cigarettes are slim, reusable, metal-tube devices containing nicotine-laced liquids that come in exotic flavors. When users puff, the nicotine is heated and released as a vapor containing no tar, unlike conventional cigarette smoke. Health experts have raised concerns that the burgeoning $2 billion e-cigarette industry, which has been virtually unregulated, would reverse gains in the decades-long effort to curb youth smoking in the United States. Just 15.7 percent of U.S. teenagers reported smoking in 2013, the lowest rate on record.In April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration proposed rules that would ban the sale of e-cigarettes to anyone under 18 but would not restrict flavored products, online sales or advertising, which public health advocates say attract children. Earlier this month, attorneys general from 29 states urged the FDA to strengthen those rules to better protect young people from nicotine addiction.""We are very concerned about nicotine use among our youth, regardless of whether it comes from conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes or other tobacco products,"" Dr. Tim McAfee, director of CDC's Office on Smoking and Health, said in a statement. ""Not only is nicotine highly addictive, it can harm adolescent brain development.""In the CDC study, researchers analyzed data from the 2011, 2012, and 2013 National Youth Tobacco Surveys of students in grades 6-12. They found that more than 263,000 who had never smoked a conventional cigarette used e-cigarettes in 2013, up from 79,000 in 2011.Among non-smoking youth who had tried electronic cigarettes, 43.9 percent said they intended to smoke conventional cigarettes within the next year, compared with 21.5 percent of those who had never used e-cigarettes.Lorillard Inc leads the U.S. e-cigarette market, while Reynolds American Inc and Altria Group Inc  are rolling out their own brands nationwide this summer. A Wells Fargo analyst report in July projected that U.S. sales of e-cigarettes would outpace conventional ones by 2020.

""I would think that they would remain consistent."" Reynolds said it was optimistic the deal would be approved.

In 1994, the commission sued to stop British American Tobacco's $1 billion purchase of American Tobacco. The two sides eventually settled, and the merger went forward. A person knowledgeable about the thinking of current FTC decision-makers said at least some believe it is important for the agency to prevent a rise in cigarette prices to protect the poor and uneducated, even if that contradicts public health goals.Data from the Centers for Disease Control show that smoking is increasingly limited to this vulnerable group.The FTC has also taken action against cigarette companies.

Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc  leads the market with a 49 percent share.Lorillard's shareholders also approved the deal, with about 80 percent of outstanding shares voted in favor.Reynolds shares rose as much 2 percent to a record high in early trading, while Lorillard shares rose about 1 percent.Reynolds said in November that it expected the Federal Trade Commission to announce its decision in late January or early February. The company said on Wednesday that about 451 million of its outstanding shares were voted in favor of the proposal to issue stock to Lorillard shareholders for the acquisition. (bit.ly/1ywZI15)More than 451 million shares of Reynolds were voted in favor of issuing stock to British American Tobacco Plc, its largest shareholder with a 42 percent stake.The number of shares voted in favor of the two proposals separately represent about 85 percent of Reynolds' outstanding shares as of Oct. 6. Both the proposals had to be approved by Reynolds' shareholders to complete the merger.

50,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A sharply divided U.S. appeals court on Monday cleared the way for the European Union to pursue its lawsuit accusing R.J. Reynolds of running a global money-laundering scheme that involved drug and cigarette smuggling.By an 8-5 vote that prompted four written dissents, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York let stand an April 2014 ruling by a three-judge panel of the same court in favor of France, Germany, Italy and 23 other European countries.These countries accused R.J. Reynolds of directing a decade-long scheme from the United States that involved the smuggling of illegal narcotics into Europe by Colombian and Russian crime groups, the laundering of proceeds from the sale of these drugs, and the use of these proceeds by importers to buy R.J. Reynolds cigarettes.The European Union said this hurt its economies and legitimate markets, deprived member nations of tax revenue, and violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a U.S. anti-racketeering law. The lawsuit began in 2002. R.J. Reynolds is part of Reynolds American Inc, the 2nd-largest U.S. tobacco company, whose brands include Camel and Pall Mall. The Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based company is awaiting regulatory approval to buy rival Lorillard Inc.Neither R.J. Reynolds nor its lawyers immediately responded to requests for comment. The company has called the lawsuit baseless.A lawyer for the EU countries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The 2nd Circuit has been a leader in limiting the use of U.S. law to police foreign conduct, in the wake of a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision finding a presumption against doing so.But the three-judge panel said that because some criminal laws underlying RICO involved foreign conduct, violations could provide a basis for punishment under that law. It also said the U.S. Congress ""unmistakably"" intended RICO to cover R.J. Reynolds' alleged conduct.Circuit Judge José Cabranes, one of the five dissenters, called Monday's ""regrettable"" decision ""a case of Congress giving an inch and the panel taking a mile,"" which wrongly opens the doors of U.S. courthouses to many civil RICO claims.""If this decision remains undisturbed, the prevailing plaintiffs here, the European Community and its member states, will have achieved a pyrrhic victory,"" he wrote.

64,"   By Jilian Mincer | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Frustrated by the slow pace of federal action, state attorneys general are waging their own campaigns against the sale and advertising of e-cigarettes to minors.More than a dozen AGs, including those in New York, California, Indiana and Ohio, are using new state and local laws - some of which they helped craft - to put pressure on the industry at all levels, from neighborhood vape shops to big tobacco companies like Altria Group (MO.N) and Reynolds American Inc (RAI.N). Much of the campaign so far has involved threats to sue violators or appeals to a company's sense of responsibility, though some lawsuits have been filed, too.    State actions have accelerated in the wake of government data released in April, which showed that teen use of e-cigarettes tripled in 2014 alone, making them more common for youngsters than tobacco. “The key is to avoid another generation being addicted to nicotine,” Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in an interview. State attorneys general played a pivotal role during the 1990s in battling tobacco companies over conventional cigarettes. The Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), an accord reached in November 1998 between the state attorneys general of 46 states, five U.S. territories, the District of Columbia and the five largest tobacco companies, resulted in significant changes to cigarette marketing and required the tobacco industry to pay the states about $10 billion annually for the indefinite future.FEDERAL ACTION URGED Nearly a year ago, a group of AGs asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to take a tougher line on e-cigarettes, the risks and benefits of which are still being studied.  In April of 2014, the agency proposed banning the sale of e-cigarettes to people under the age of 18, but did not recommend prohibiting advertising, flavored products or online sales – all of which help make the devices attractive to youngsters, according to public health advocates.The FDA proposal has been under review ever since, which has meant that vaping remains legal for youths in states that haven't passed laws banning it. The agency is likely to finalize its new e-cigarette regulations later this summer, though it could be several years before the federal rules go into effect.  Federal regulations and the 1998 Master Settlement prohibit makers of conventional cigarettes from targeting youth and from advertising on television, billboards and mass transit, but the rules don’t apply to e-cigarettes.So far, however, 46 states have passed laws banning their sale to minors. Twelve of those states have also passed laws requiring child-proof packaging for e-liquids and e-cigarettes, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.AGs are using these laws, as well as others not directly tied to e-cigarettes, to force companies to drop ads appealing to teens, switch to child-proof packaging and spend thousands of dollars on more vigilant age verification systems for their websites and online deliveries.In June, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced settlements with four companies that were not complying with the state’s rule about child resistant packaging for nicotine liquids.  Reuters spoke with more than 10 e-cigarette and vaping companies - including Reynolds American, which sells Vuse, and Altria Group, which sells MarkTen and Green Smoke – that acknowledged they have been contacted by state law enforcers or by the National Associations of Attorneys General. Reynolds and Altria say their brands were not in violation of local laws.  COORDINATING EFFORTS Some of the AGs have coordinated their efforts. One group is pressuring certain e-cigarette manufacturers and vendors to limit ads that appeal to teens, especially on company websites and places like YouTube. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, along with colleagues from several other states, sent a letter in April to privately-held manufacturer NJOY, asking it to “immediately instruct YouTube to restrict” access to its advertisements to adults. NJOY said in an April letter to DeWine that more than 90 percent of the U.S. viewers who have watched its hosted YouTube videos are at least 18, and the company said it would suspend videos if that figure fell to 85 percent or less.  NJOY, which previously settled a case with California over allegations of targeting minors and deceptive marketing, would not comment further.California has sent letters to more than 150 e-cigarette and vaping companies in recent years “to encourage voluntary compliance with applicable state and federal laws,"" including a ban on sales to youth, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. The state is also pursuing companies that sell fruit- flavored vaping liquids that appeal to teens and those that make false or misleading statements in their advertisements. One letter sent by the state asked a manufacturer to quit claiming that “electronic cigarettes are one of the safest forms of nicotine available” and that “when you exhale, you are exhaling harmless water vapor.""“Many companies have taken some or all of our recommended steps,” said Kristin Ford, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Kamala Harris.AGs are paying particular attention to sales on websites, a popular source of vaping materials for teens, who trade information about which ones require little proof of age.Jan Verleur, CEO and co-founder of electronic cigarette company VMR Products, said his company changed its age verification system in some states after being contacted by a state AG. He estimated the cost per order would increase by about 50 cents, but would not say if VMR would absorb any of that. The company makes about half its sales online.“This is bad news for the smaller players and good news for the tobacco companies, whose business model relied on mass manufacturing, not personalized products,” said Philip Gorham, an equity analyst at Morningstar who covers consumer products.    (Reporting by Jilian Mincer; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Sue Horton)",2015-07-10,RAI,"Fri Jul 10, 2015 | 6:29am EDT","Exclusive: With feds slow to act, states target e-cigarette sales to minors",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-ecigarettes-minors-idUSKCN0PK0C120150710?type=companyNews,0.9362,0.041,0.902,0.057
65,"  (Adds FDA statement, Reynolds American declining to comment and comment from ITG Brands)Aug 27 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned the makers of Winston, Natural American Spirit and Nat Sherman cigarettes that they cannot claim their products are ""natural"" or ""additive-free"" without regulatory approval.The FDA first gained authority to regulate cigarettes in 2009, partly in reaction to the tobacco industry's misuse of terms such as ""mild"" and ""light"" to suggest those products were less dangerous.The FDA now requires any company seeking to claim that one tobacco product is less dangerous than another to prove it with scientific evidence. The agency said the products would need to obtain a ""modified risk"" tobacco product order before they can be described as ""natural"" and ""additive-free.""""The FDA's job is to ensure tobacco products are not marketed in a way that leads consumers to believe cigarettes with descriptors like 'additive-free' and 'natural' pose fewer health risks than other cigarettes, unless the claims have been scientifically supported,"" Mitch Zeller, director of the FDA's tobacco products division, said in a statement. On Monday roughly 30 health organizations, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Heart Association and the American Thoracic Society wrote to the FDA urging it to take action against Reynolds American Inc  and its subsidiary, Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Co for the marketing of Natural American Spirit cigarettes.In their letter the anti-tobacco groups noted that sales of Natural American Spirit rose 86 percent between 2009 to 2014 while sales of all cigarettes nationally declined by 17 percent. ""We are pleased that the Food and Drug Administration today has taken action to protect the American public from deception,"" said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.Reynolds American and Sherman's 1400 Broadway NYC Ltd, maker of Nat Sherman cigarettes, said they had received the FDA's letter but declined to comment further. ITG Brands, maker of Winston, said in a statement the company disagrees with the FDA and believes its products comply with all state and federal regulations.""Winston has been marketed with its current packaging for more than 15 years and in compliance with an agreement entered into with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission,"" said the company, which is owned by Imperial Tobacco Group Plc.

83,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK S&P Dow Jones Indices is negotiating with asset managers to license its new index, which it says represents companies that focus on the long term rather than the current quarter.   The Long-Term Value Creation Global Index .SPLTVCUN could be the basis for one or more mutual funds, exchange-traded funds or structured products, Vinit Srivastava, S&P's senior director of equity strategy, said in an interview last week.    S&P created the index over the past year in response to concerns that company executives, under pressure from hard-charging board overseers and the earnings calendar, have put short-term wins ahead of building businesses that thrive over time.Designed with the help of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the index consists of companies with what S&P considers strong corporate-governance plans and solid financial numbers.""We have to do things to stop that short-term focus,"" said Poul Winslow, managing director at Toronto-based CPPIB. He said the index relied on a scoring system that draws out important details about how companies are governed.The CPPIB and other institutional investors have committed $2 billion to private funds tracking the index.S&P, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc MHFI.N and the largest provider of indexes tracked by U.S.-listed ETFs, has not decided whether such a license would be exclusive to one asset manager. Srivastava declined to name any bidders or comment further on the discussions. Bringing such a product to market could take several months of planning and regulatory approvals.Asset managers have already had something of a hand in the effort. Focusing Capital on the Long Term, a group that advocated for the index and was founded by CPPIB and management consultant McKinsey & Co in 2013, counts senior management from fund-managing companies BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and State Street Corp (STT.N) among its members and advisers. DEFINING LONG-TERM To come up with its index, S&P starts with the largest public companies and allocates money to those that produce a hefty return on equity and seem to develop strong policies on legal compliance, environmental reporting and philanthropy. Such practices, advocates like Winslow said, can predict performance better than balance sheets.Among the top companies in the index are health insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N), coffee chain Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and industrial conglomerate 3M Co (MMM.N). However, the index does not screen out companies that spend cash buying back their own shares, even though such repurchases have been criticized by investors who would rather see the money go to long-term ventures like capital expenditures or workforce development. One of the long-term index's top holdings, retailer O'Reilly Automotive Inc (ORLY.O), is also one of the largest components of the S&P 500 Buyback Index .SPBUYUP.Srivastava said companies with good governance rules tend to do buybacks ""for the right reasons.""The index's focus on corporate governance does not necessarily mean a focus on social issues, even though pension funds often consider such criteria.Two of the index's top 10 holdings are tobacco companies Reynolds American Inc (RAI.N) and Altria Group Inc (MO.N), which socially conscious investors often screen out.

88,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed Reynolds American Inc.'s  (Reynolds) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB' and Short-Term IDR of  'F2' on Rating Watch Positive. The actions follows today's announcement by  British American Tobacco plc (BAT, 'A-'/Outlook Negative) of its proposed merger  with Reynolds.  The current terms of the proposal include a cash offer of $20 billion and an  equity component of $27 billion, for total consideration of $47 billion ($60  billion including the assumption of $13 billion of Reynolds debt).  A full list of rating actions, which apply to approximately $13 billion of  Reynolds debt at Sept. 30, 2016, appears at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Affirmation or Upgrade Likely: The Rating Watch Positive reflects Fitch's view  that (based on information currently available) the most likely outcome if the  merger is completed as currently contemplated would be either an affirmation or  a one-notch upgrade of Reynolds' 'BBB' ratings. However, significant uncertainty  remains as to the structure of the transaction, and, Fitch could potentially  equalize Reynolds and BAT's ratings as more information becomes available. These  structural considerations include whether BAT guarantees Reynolds' debt and the  outcome of Fitch's analysis of parent/subsidiary linkage.  If the merger is not completed, Fitch will most likely affirm Reynolds' existing  ratings with a Stable Outlook. Higher Leverage: Fitch calculates that BAT's consolidated funds from operations  (FFO)-based gross leverage could rise to over 6.0x on a pro forma basis in 2017,  when the transaction should close. This equates to total debt/consolidated  EBITDA of 4.5x in 2017, up from BAT's 2015's 4.4x and 2.8x, respectively.  Scope for Subsequent Deleveraging: BAT has historically targeted a net  debt/EBITDA ratio of between 1.5x to 2.5x, and Fitch expects management to aim  for a swift deleveraging path and protect BAT's investment grade rating.  However, based on its estimation of annual pre-dividends consolidated FCF of  approximately GBP6 billion and the assumption that BAT would reduce dividend  pay-out back to 65%, Fitch projects that the merged entity would only reduce  consolidated FFO adjusted leverage toward 5.0x by FY19. Enhanced Competitive Position: The combined entity would benefit from enhanced  geographic diversification. BAT would benefit from gaining full exposure to the  very large and profitable U.S. tobacco market, while retaining its exposure to  relatively faster growing emerging markets. The combination would also create  scope for cost and product development synergies. BAT currently estimates  approximately $400 million of cost synergies that are not included in Fitch's  current financial forecasts. BAT's ratings would reflect the combined entities' position as the largest  publicly traded global tobacco company, supported by the diversity of its  portfolio of brands and of the countries it operates in. BAT's geographical  diversity, including high-growth emerging markets that Fitch estimates  contribute more than 50% of total profits, enables the company to protect  profits through price increases and cost rationalization in an industry that is  facing declining consumption. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for the issuer include: --BAT acquires full control of Reynolds for USD20 billion cash in mid-2017;  --BAT assumes $13 billion of Reynolds' debt; --Organic annual revenue and profit growth of low single digits for both the BAT  and Reynolds' businesses; --GBP/USD exchange rate of 0.83; --Annualized cost synergies of around $400 million by 2019 with a related  implementation cost of $400 million spread between 2018 and 2019; --65% dividend payout ratio. RATING SENSITIVITIES If the merger is completed as currently contemplated, Fitch would likely either  affirm Reynolds' ratings or upgrade them by one notch. If Reynolds' merger with BAT is not completed, future developments that may  individually or collectively lead to a positive rating action for Reynolds  include: --Mitigation of negative industry factors with an emphasis on the slowing or  reversal of secular volume declines;  --Reynolds fully offsetting cigarette volume pressures with meaningful portfolio  diversification; --Significantly reducing litigation risk, most notably the Engle progeny  exposure; --A commitment to a conservative financial strategy demonstrated by lower  dividend pay-outs and a commitment to maintain gross leverage below 2.0x. If Reynolds' merger with BAT is not completed, future developments that may  individually or collectively lead to a negative rating action for Reynolds  include: --EBITDA pressures arising from greater than expected market contraction or a  heightened competitive environment, such that gross debt leverage rises and  stays above 2.5x; --Regulatory decisions immediately banning sale of mentholated cigarettes or  meaningfully increasing state or federal excise taxes on smoking products that  significantly accelerates volume declines; --Substantial changes in the litigation process, whereby legal cases may reach  verdict quicker and/or material adverse judgments significantly increase in  number and amount. LIQUIDITY On a stand-alone basis, Reynolds has solid liquidity with cash of $1.9 billion  and full availability under a $2 billion revolver due Dec. 2020, as of Sept.  30,2016. Internal liquidity provided by strong operating cash flows that  increase annually and which Fitch models to exceed $2.5 billion in 2016. Excess  liquidity is important given Reynolds' annual payment to the MSA that is  expected to average around $3 billion over the next three years. On April 15,  R.J. Reynolds made its MSA payment of $2.3 billion, which included $597 million  paid into the non-participating manufacturer disputed payments account.  Reynolds targets a shareholder pay-out ratio of 80% of net income. The company  has increased its dividend by 250% since 2004, paying over $12 billion in  dividends over that time period Fitch models shareholder dividends to exceed $2  billion in 2016, consuming the majority of operating cash flow and pressuring  FCF.  Reynolds' debt structure is well laddered, and the company faces no significant  near-term debt maturities until 2018 when $1.25 billion of senior unsecured  notes mature. Fitch expects that Reynolds will be able to refinance its debt  maturities in normally functioning capital markets. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has placed the following ratings on Rating Watch Positive: Reynolds American Inc. --IDR 'BBB'; --Short-term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial paper 'F2': --Senior unsecured credit facility 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company --IDR 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'.

91,"   By Martinne Geller, Paul Sandle and Pamela Barbaglia | LONDON  LONDON British American Tobacco (BATS.L) has offered to buy out U.S. cigarette maker Reynolds American Inc (RAI.N) in a $47 billion takeover that would create the world's biggest listed tobacco company with brands including Newport, Lucky Strike and Pall Mall.The cash-and-stock deal would mark the return of BAT to the lucrative and highly regulated U.S. market after a 12-year absence, making it the only tobacco giant with a leading presence in American and international markets. It would also give the British company - which has been bolstered by a strong share price since the country voted to leave the European Union - more premium brands such as Camel which it can sell in countries like Russia and Turkey where demand for Western cigarettes is still growing.The marriage would also unite each company's efforts in the fast-developing world of e-cigarettes, which the companies say are less dangerous than smoking - a habit that kills about six million people worldwide each year. BAT shares closed down almost 2.9 percent, while Reynolds was up almost 7 percent in afternoon trading in New York.Morningstar analyst Adam Fleck said the BAT decline could be because ""the price looks rich to us.""  ""Our take is that it is a little bit over valued,"" he said.  Moody’s also said Friday it is reviewing BAT's A3 ratings for a possible downgrade.""Our decision to place BAT's ratings on review for downgrade recognizes that, while the acquisition will enhance BAT's business profile, it could lead to a significant deterioration in BAT's credit metrics,"" says Ernesto Bisagno a Moody's Vice President and lead analyst for BAT.A Reynolds takeover by BAT, which already owns 42 percent of the U.S. group, has long been seen as part of an inevitable wave of global consolidation in a mature industry. Yet the timing, less than three weeks before a U.S. presidential election, was unexpected.""This proposed deal manages to be both entirely expected and a surprise,"" Euromonitor analyst Shane MacGuill said. The completion of last year's purchase by Reynolds of Lorillard, which gave it the popular Newport brand, and the current relative valuations of the two companies' shares were the main reasons the deal was resurrected in recent weeks, said three sources close to the situation. ""It moved very quickly on the back of the falling pound,"" said one of the sources, who all declined to be named in discussing private matters. A final decision was made this week, they said.A 12 percent rise in BAT's shares since Britons opted for Brexit in June, and a 7 percent fall for Reynolds, brought the companies' trading multiples closer together, making a deal more affordable, the sources said. The move increased the value of the share element of the offer for the U.S. shareholders of Reynolds, even as it made the cash portion more costly for the UK company. But one source likened the deal to simplifying Reynolds's structure by removing the stake it does not own. ""It's always been on the cards,"" he said.After the Brexit vote, shares in BAT soared to all-time highs as investors bet the falling pound would lift the value of overseas revenue. BAT, whose share appreciation is less pronounced in dollar terms, does the vast majority of its  business outside the country. It has over 200 brands in over 200 markets.The pound has lost about a fifth of its value against the dollar since the EU referendum on June 23.With little geographic overlap and therefore limited antitrust issues, this deal is also a lot simpler than another oft-speculated deal - that BAT would take over British rival Imperial Brands (IMB.L), the source added.Imperial shares were up 2 percent on Friday, with one analyst saying a general reignition of consolidation in the industry may be outweighing the fact that BAT is now unlikely to bid for its rival in the near term.Altria Group (MO.N) shares were up 4 percent in New York, boosted by hopes that an enlarged BAT would push Swiss-based market leader Philip Morris International (PM.N) to reunite with the U.S. company. The Marlboro maker split into two in 2008, when the risk of litigation in the United States was seen as a deterrent to foreign companies.CASH AND STOCK  Reynolds, based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, acknowledged receipt of the unsolicited offer. This was made public immediately after BAT's approach to the Reynolds board, as required by U.S. securities regulators in cases where the buyer is a big shareholder. Reynolds said it would review the offer and respond in due course.The British group said its offer valued Reynolds's shares at $56.50, of which $24.13 would be in cash and $32.37 would be in BAT shares, representing a premium of 20 percent over the closing price of Reynolds stock on Thursday. On Friday afternoon Reynolds shares, at $53.73, were below the offer price.  Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she expected Reynolds to push for a higher price than the $47 billion BAT is offering for the remaining 57.8 percent of the company. Under the offer, $20 billion would be in cash and $27 billion in BAT shares.One source estimated that BAT valued Reynolds's shares at 16.3 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), higher than what Reynolds paid for Lorillard.BAT Chief Executive Nicandro Durante, a long-distance runner who hails from Sao Paolo, Brazil, said the deal would create a U.S. market leader and the world's largest listed tobacco company by net turnover and operating profit.""The strategic rationale makes perfect sense,"" Guy Ellison, an analyst at Investec Wealth & Investment, said. He cited a BAT  pivot toward the large U.S. market - whose profit pool is protected by high barriers to entry - and improved scale in vapor products like e-cigarettes, which all big tobacco companies are investing in to offset declines in smoking. BAT said the deal would add to earnings in the first year after closure and estimated cost savings of about $400 million. It is contingent on approval from independent members of the Reynolds board who were not nominated by BAT.COMING TO AMERICA The recent strength of BAT's share price is also due to geopolitical uncertainty leading investors to seek out stable, dividend-yielding stocks like tobacco and other consumer staples. Shares in Reynolds fell to a 12-month low on Wednesday of $43.38 after its third quarter earnings were 6 percent short of market forecasts, Jefferies analysts said, on the back of a 1.5 percent fall in domestic cigarette volumes.  If successful, the takeover would be one of the biggest this year globally. Including debt, this would be the largest UK outbound M&A deal this year and the fourth largest of all-time, according to Reuters data.BAT stopped operating in the United States in 2004, when it merged its U.S. subsidiary Brown & Williamson with R.J. Reynolds to form Reynolds American. Due to a series of high-profile U.S. lawsuits against tobacco firms, the big four have all limited their exposure to the market. Yet several cases have now been settled, which has led analysts to speculate that international players could return.Imperial Brands waded into the U.S. market last year with its $7 billion purchase of certain brands from Reynolds to ease the $25 billion purchase of Lorillard.  Smoking rates in the United States and other western markets are declining due to increasing health consciousness, and greater regulation and taxes. Yet their addictive nature and high profit margins make them a profitable business.BAT is being advised by Centerview, Deutsche Bank and UBS.BAT also said on Friday it had performed well in the first nine months of the year, raising both revenue at constant rates of exchange and cigarette volumes.

94,"   By Jillian Harding  Over the last 20 years, tobacco companies have buying one another out as health warnings, regulatory crackdowns and insurance incentives have decimated the U.S. market for cigarettes.  Four companies — Philip Morris, Reynolds American, ITG Brands, and Liggett – had roughly 91 percent of U.S. cigarette sales in 2015.  So it makes sense that British American Tobacco would bid $47 billion for the 58 percent stake in Reynolds American it doesn't already own.But it begs the question: Where’s the growth? The answer is e-cigarettes.

Their “Vuse” product, marketed under the RJR Vapor subsidiary, is the top selling brand in the United States, with a 33.6 percent share of the market, according to Nielsen.  Of course, the e-cigarette market has its own share of health and regulatory risks. But Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a recent note that Reynolds American could benefit from regulations, because Big Tobacco can bear costs that smaller e-cigarette and vapor firms cannot.In other words, smaller e-cigarette firms may disappear.

97,"  LONDON Oct 21 British American Tobacco  has offered to buy U.S. tobacco company Reynolds American Inc  in a $47 billion deal bringing together Newport, Kent and Pall Mall cigarettes to create the U.S. market leader.The British group, which has a 42 percent stake in Reynolds,  said its offer valued the company's shares at $56.50, of which $24.13 would be in cash and $32.37 would be in BAT shares, representing a premium of 20 percent over the closing price of Reynolds common stock on Oct. 20.  The total consideration for the remaining 57.8 percent of Reynolds would be $47 billion, of which approximately $20 billion would be in cash and $27 billion in BAT shares, it said on Friday.

98,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON/MILAN, October 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has placed British American  Tobacco plc's (BAT) Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured  ratings of 'A-' on Rating Watch Negative (RWN) following last Friday's  announcement by BAT of its proposed merger with US-based Reynolds American Inc.  (Reynolds or RAI, BBB/Rating Watch Positive). A full list of rating actions is  shown at the end of this commentary. The rating action reflects the likely material balance sheet re-leveraging of  BAT, should its plans to launch a formal offer for RAI and proceed to a merger  be successful at the terms published on Friday 21 October 2016. At the same  time, the transaction would enhance BAT's geographic diversification by giving  it full exposure to the very large and profitable US tobacco market. It would  also create scope for cost and product development synergies from the  integration of two companies that share the same brands but are run separately.  Reynold's board has yet to respond to the proposal. The ratings are likely to be  downgraded by up to two notches upon a successful completion of the merger, or  affirmed if the transaction fails to complete.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Leverage Increase: Based on the current terms of the proposal, BAT plans to  finance the acquisition price of the 57.8% it does not own by offering cash of  USD20bn (GBP16.6bn) and a large equity component for approximately 60% of the  total price. We calculate that BAT's consolidated funds from operations  (FFO)-based gross leverage could rise in 2017 on a pro-forma basis, when the  transaction should close, to over 6.0x (equating to total debt/consolidated  EBITDA of 4.5x in 2017, up from 2015's respectively 4.4x and 2.8x. This leverage  would not be compatible with a rating in the 'A' category.  The transaction will take time to complete, but we expect limited free cash flow  (FCF) generation in 2016 by BAT and project net debt to increase at the end of  the financial year to December 2016 (FY16) - from FYE15's GBP15.2bn as a result  of currency movements. Scope for Subsequent Deleveraging: BAT has historically targeted a net  debt/EBITDA ratio of between 1.5x to 2.5x and we expect management to aim for  swift deleveraging and protect BAT's investment-grade rating. However, based on  our estimation of annual pre-dividends consolidated FCF of approximately GBP6bn  and the assumption that BAT would reduce its dividend payout back to 65%, we  project that the merged entity would only reduce consolidated FFO adjusted  leverage towards 5.0x by FY19, a level which we can tolerate as 'BBB',  considering its pro forma solid business profile and profitability would be  compatible with a strong investment-grade rating. Strong, Stable Business Profile: The ratings would continue to reflect BAT's  position as a leading international tobacco company, supported by the diversity  of its portfolio of brands and of the countries it operates in. BAT's  geographical diversity, including high-growth emerging markets which Fitch  estimates contribute more than over 50% of total profits, enables the company to  protect profits through price increases and cost rationalisation in an industry  that is facing declining consumption. In addition, BAT continues to make  progress on its cost rationalisation programmes which allow supporting  improvements in its operating profit margin. Attractive US Tobacco Industry: We calculate that as a result of this  transaction, BAT would derive almost 50% of its profits from the US market. The  US cigarette industry remains in secular decline, typically in a range of 3% to  4% per year in terms of cigarette volumes, but the industry benefits from an  oligopoly structure with essentially three players commanding over 90% of  volumes. RAI is the second largest, and has a track record of consistent price  increases that compensate for volume declines. Fitch believes the risk of tobacco litigation court cases leading to major  payouts by tobacco companies has significantly abated in the US market.  Furthermore, in our view the plan to ban menthol cigarettes - which generate  more than 50% of RAI's revenues - seems less likely now.  DERIVATION SUMMARY In a post-RAI merger scenario, BAT would have an initially very high leverage of  6.0x for a BBB-rated tobacco company ('BBB' FFO net leverage median is 3.5x;  'BB' is 4.5x) and this would fall in 2019 (second full year) below 5.0x. The  company's operational profile supports a higher rating than those medians. BAT  would remain the second-largest player in the US (after Altria) and  internationally (after PMI) but, on a consolidated basis, would become slightly  larger than current industry leader PMI. It will continue to enjoy similarly  strong EBITDA margins compared to major tobacco peers and have a very strong FCF  margin (post dividends) of around 10%.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: - BAT acquires full control of RAI for USD20bn (GBP16.6bn) cash in mid-2017  - BAT assumes USD13bn (GBP11bn) of RAI's debt - Organic annual revenue and profit growth of low single digits for both the BAT  and RAI businesses - USD/GBP exchange rate of 0.83 - Annualised cost synergies of around USD400m (GBP330m) by 2019 with a related  implementation cost of around USD400m spread between 2018 and 2019 - 65% dividend payout  RATING SENSITIVITIES Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive  Rating Action Subject to BAT not proceeding with a merger with RAI, Fitch would affirm the IDR  at the current level with a Stable Outlook based on the following parameters:FFO adjusted net leverage below 3.0xFCF margin recovering above 3%, reflecting a stable operating environment and  more conservative shareholder remuneration FFO fixed charge cover staying above 6.0x Future Developments That May, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative  Rating Action  Upon conclusion of the merger Fitch would downgrade BAT's rating by up to two  notches in the following circumstances: the expectation that BAT's FFO adjusted net leverage will remain above 3.5x for  over two years post merger completion FFO fixed charge cover under 6.0x (2015: 6.1x) LIQUIDITY Adequate Liquidity: On a standalone basis BAT has strong liquidity with no more  than 20% of total debt maturing over a 12-month period, cash balances averaging  GBP1.5bn-GBP2.0bn and a GBP3.0bn revolving bank facility due May 2020. We assume  that, should BAT proceed to a merger with RAI the USD20bn would be funded mainly  with bonds and we take comfort from BAT's ability to regularly access the debt  markets.

BakerOct 25 It has been six years since Goldman Sachs Group Inc, a perennial No. 1 in the M&A league tables, did not feature as an adviser on the year's biggest deal. But sticking with Rupert Murdoch over Bugs Bunny just cost it this year's biggest deal.Goldman missed out on an advisory role on telecom giant AT&T's deal to buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion because of its perceived conflict stemming from advising media mogul Murdoch's Twenty-First Century Fox Inc two years ago, when it made a failed bid for Time Warner.The media conglomerate's franchises range from CNN and HBO to Harry Potter films, hit TV show ""The Big Bang Theory"" and Bugs Bunny.

""This can put banks in an impossible position, because companies often expect them to turn down business now for the uncertain prospect of business later.""To be sure, the year is not yet over, and on a global basis, Goldman remains the undisputed king. The 147-year-old investment bank has ranked No. 1 in the global M&A league tables every year since 1997, with the exception of 2009 and 2010, when it ranked No. 2 behind Morgan Stanley. The last time Goldman missed out on the biggest deal of the year was 2010, on the $27.5 billion acquisition of Mexican telecommunications group Carso Global Telecom by America Movil.But Goldman's absence from the AT&T-Time Warner deal shows that even the most successful investment banks can miss out on mega-deals by virtue of companies showing a preference for advisers that stick with them rather than their competitors.When this year's second-biggest deal was announced last month, Bayer AG's $66 billion acquisition of seeds and agrichemicals group Monsanto Co, Goldman was also absent from the advisers listed.Goldman had won no favor with Monsanto after having helped thwart its hostile bid for Syngenta AG last year by providing advice to the Swiss seeds company, and subsequently helping it sell itself to ChemChina for $43 billion instead.

105,"   By Jonathan Stempel  A federal appeals court on Tuesday rejected R.J. Reynolds' bid to void a decade-old order requiring tobacco companies to televise ""corrective"" advertisements about the dangers of smoking.The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Reynolds American Inc unit, whose brands include Camel, Newport and Pall Mall, did not show that the judge who ordered the ads exceeded her authority, and waited too long to challenge the requirement.Reynolds American spokesman Bryan Hatchell declined to comment.The ads were among a series of remedial measures imposed in 2006 by U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler in Washington, D.C. against R.J. Reynolds, Altria Group Inc's Philip Morris USA and other tobacco companies, after she found them liable for concealing the risks of smoking for decades. Kessler had required that each defendant run primetime ads on a major TV network at least once a week for a year.The companies later litigated over what the ads should say.But R.J. Reynolds also objected to the U.S. Department of Justice's insistence that it run two sets of ads, one for itself and one in its capacity as the successor to Brown & Williamson, which it bought in 2004. In Tuesday's decision, however, Circuit Judge David Tatel said R.J. Reynolds failed to raise the double-ad issue in 2006 when it first appealed Kessler's remedial order.He said this meant the Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based company could not be excused for waiting until 2014, when the government made its position known during negotiations, to object. ""Simply put, RJR cannot have it both ways,"" Tatel wrote.

108,"   By Christopher Spink  Nov 1 (IFR) - Reynolds American's appointment of Goldman Sachs as sole adviser to a panel of independent directors in relation to a takeover approach by British American Tobacco should extend the US bank's commanding lead in the announced M&A league tables.Last month, Goldman's lead narrowed after nearest rival Morgan Stanley was appointed by Time Warner alongside Allen & Co and Citigroup to defend the US$85bn approach for the cable company from telecoms group AT&T. Goldman has no role on that deal. But the situation is reversed in the Reynolds possible transaction. BAT has made a US$46.5bn offer to acquire the 57.8% stake in its US rival that it does not already own, and is advised by Centerview, Deutsche Bank and UBS.Reynolds appointed advisers late on Monday. Goldman Sachs will lead advice to a transaction committee consisting of independent directors not designated by BAT. Goldman arguably has a more challenging role in considering alternatives for shareholders than JP Morgan and Lazard, who have been appointed to advise Reynolds on the approach. Morgan Stanley is not involved in any of the groups. So far only Lazard has been credited by Thomson Reuters with league table credit for the Reynolds' proposal. If the other two banks also get the US$57bn up for grabs, then Goldman Sachs would have advised on US$745bn of announced deals so far this year, giving it a US$112bn lead over Morgan Stanley. Third-placed JP Morgan would be US$16bn behind Morgan Stanley.(Reporting by Christopher Spink)",2016-11-01,RAI,"Tue Nov 1, 2016 | 9:35am EDT",Goldman extends M&A lead after Reynolds appointment,http://www.reuters.com//article/idUSL8N1D24DR?type=companyNews,0.8738,0.017,0.919,0.064
