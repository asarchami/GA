9,"  By Liana B. BakerLAS VEGAS Jan 7 Sony Corp will begin testing a new television service that combines traditional viewing with on-demand content through its PlayStation gaming system, a cloud-based service could possibly change long-established cable and media industry relationships.Sony executives described the as-yet unnamed service on Tuesday as a blend of live cable, on-demand and DVR content. Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, they promised an intuitive design for searching for content - addressing a common complaint of cable customers.Sony's embryonic effort builds on similar moves by Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp. Viewers could buy viewing packages through Sony, much as customers now do through cable operators like Comcast. As envisioned, the service would allow subscribers to play games, call up TV shows and movies, and tune into broadcast channels via a single box.It was unclear how advanced Sony's project was. It did not announce any deals with media companies, but said details will be forthcoming and the service will be tested and unveiled this year.Sony CEO Kaz Hirai told reporters on Tuesday the company had struck up ""a good dialogue"" with content holders, or media companies. But he stopped short of describing the impact on the cable industry.Hirai denied that Sony's service would compete with pay TV companies such as Comcast or DirecTV even though it plans to sell consumers a package of live television channels, which they currently get through cable providers. ""We're offering live TV and we're combining it with other video services... We don't set out to do this and say we're going to compete with cable companies,"" he told reporters. ""Whether you believe it's competitive or not, that's your question.""Sony, which already owns a major film and entertainment production business, says it is trying to create a more personal service for consumers accustomed to getting much of their TV content through cable providers.Intel Corp also tried to shake up the traditional TV industry with Intel TV. But the chipmaker has struggled to seal deals with major media corporations, and is looking to sell the business.Negotiations between new players and entrenched cable and media industry companies have been tricky. Industry sources say the difficulty of working out subscriber fees, plus media providers' reluctance to jeopardize long-established relationships and businesses, have complicated efforts by Apple  and Intel to stream content directly off the cloud and into living rooms. TOUCH AND GO Hirai said the Playstation's installed user-base of about 70 million households gave Sony a competitive advantage. Microsoft Corp, the other big purveyor of gaming consoles, is also battling for a slice of the increasingly crowded living-room entertainment space. It plans to develop its own programs while ensuring that the Xbox One console streams popular media apps such as Netflix.Meanwhile, on-demand services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon's Instant Video are rapidly expanding their audience.""For years, consumer electronics companies have tried in various forms to transform the living room and the home entertainment experience because it is fundamentally outdated and flawed,"" Playstation chief Andrew House told the Las Vegas crowd earlier on Tuesday.House also said Sony has sold 4.2 million PlayStation 4 game consoles as of Dec. 28, surpassing the 3 million Microsoft Xbox One devices sold as of end-2013.Sony also plans to launch ""PlayStation Now"" this summer, a service that will stream games from remote cloud-based servers to consoles, TVs, tablets and smartphones, House said.That cloud-gaming service incorporates technology from Gaikai, a California-based company Sony acquired for $380 million in 2012.On Tuesday, shares in Gamestop Inc plunged 8.4 percent to $44.14 on fears that the cloud-based gaming service -- which can stream older games to the PS4 -- will jeopardize the retailer's large and growing used-game business.",2014-01-07,MSFT,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 4:46pm EST",UPDATE 2-Sony to test PlayStation-based cloud TV service,http://www.reuters.com//article/ces-sony-idUSL2N0KH1IM20140107?type=companyNews,0.8573,0.05,0.883,0.067

13,"   By Paul Carsten | BEIJING  BEIJING China has temporarily lifted a 14-year-old ban on selling video game consoles, paving the way for Sony Corp, Microsoft Corp and Nintendo Co Ltd to enter the world's third largest video game market in terms of revenue.China saw video game revenues grow by more than a third in 2012 to nearly $14 billion last year, but console makers are likely to face an uphill battle for market share in a country where a whole generation has grown up without a PlayStation, Xbox or Wii and where free PC and mobile games dominate.The absence of consoles has left PC games with almost two-thirds of the market, according to data released at the annual China games industry conference in December. Browser gaming accounted for just over 15 percent and mobile gaming was nearly 14 percent, the data also showed.""If Sony and Microsoft want to expand in China they need to think of changing their business model, and study the success of Internet gaming market providers where games are free but they charge money from operating games,"" said Roger Sheng, research director at tech research firm Gartner.China had banned games consoles in 2000, citing their adverse effect on the mental health of its youth.The suspension of the ban permits ""foreign-invested enterprises"" to make game consoles within Shanghai's free trade zone and sell them in China after inspection by cultural departments, the government's top decision-making authority, the State Council, said in a statement.The statement, posted on the council's website on Monday, did not give more details and officials were not available to clarify the ruling, or say how long the suspension would last. CAUTION ON CONSOLES The video game sector has been battered globally by the proliferation of free games on mobile devices and PCs, as well as on social networking sites. In China, the most popular video games are often free to play, with gamers only paying for add-ons such as weapons or extra lives.For console makers seeking to expand in China, price may be a problem. More than 70 percent of Chinese gamers earn less than 4,000 yuan ($634) a month, according to Hong Kong-based brokerage CLSA.The new Xbox One sells for nearly $500 in the United States, while Sony's PlayStation 4 goes for just shy of $400. New games for each console cost around $60. ""To purchase a game at 200 or 300 yuan ($33 or $50) is unbearable or unthinkable for a normal player like me,"" said Yang Anqi, a 23-year-old student at Beijing's Renmin University who has played video games for more than a decade.Nintendo, which makes the Wii consoles, told Reuters the ruling changed little from when China's government said in September last year that it planned to lift the ban.""We are still not sure exactly what we will be able to do in Shanghai, and thereafter in Greater China,"" said Yasuhiro Minagawa, Nintendo's Japan-based public relations manager.""Both with hardware and software, there are many things we have to look into and so we can't say anything concrete."" Sony also sounded a note of caution.""We do recognize that China is a promising market, and we will continue to study the possibility,"" said Satoshi Nakajima, a spokesman for Sony Computer Entertainment, the unit of Sony responsible for the PlayStation console business.Microsoft was not immediately available to comment. In September, the U.S. company formed a joint-venture with China's BesTV New Media Co Ltd and invested $237 million in ""family games and related services"".Another possible hurdle for Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo is the availability, albeit illegally, of consoles at places like Beijing's bustling Zhongguancun tech emporium, where the customers tend to be foreigners more accustomed to the devices.Unlike their international counterparts, the consoles available in China are modified to run pirated games, which sell for around $1 or can be downloaded onto a disc at home.Games consoles have been made in China for export for many years, with Foxconn, the trading name of Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, making the devices for Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft.(Additional reporting by Sophie Knight and Reiji Murai in TOKYO; Editing by Miral Fahmy)",2014-01-07,MSFT,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 6:20am EST",China suspends ban on video game consoles after more than a decade,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-china-gamesconsoles-idUSBREA0606C20140107?type=companyNews,0.9934,0.041,0.854,0.105

17,"  Jan 7 Microsoft Corp is closer to naming a new chief executive, according to a source familiar with the board's thinking, but it lost a front-runner candidate on Tuesday when Ford Motor Co's chief, Alan Mulally, said he would not be going to the software giant.Mulally's comments reignited the guessing game over who will take over at Microsoft, following the elimination in December of another reported candidate, Qualcomm Inc's Steve Mollenkopf.Microsoft said last month it expects to appoint a new CEO early this year. It has been seeking a replacement for Steve Ballmer since the long-time CEO in August announced his plan to retire. Sources familiar with the process have told Reuters that Microsoft is down to a ""handful"" of candidates, including one or more outsiders from the tech industry, former Nokia  CEO Stephen Elop and insiders Satya Nadella and Tony Bates.Mulally, who has never denied his interest in the Microsoft job, told the Associated Press on Tuesday that he will remain at Ford at least this year. Two people close to the matter told Reuters that Mulally is no longer under consideration for the top job at Microsoft. ""Out of respect for the process and the potential candidates, we don't comment on individual names,"" a Microsoft spokesman said.The Ford CEO said he wanted to end the Microsoft speculation ""because I have no other plans to do anything other than serve Ford."" When the AP asked whether his comments should end concerns from investors about his exit, Mulally said: ""You don't have to worry about me leaving."" Ford spokesman Jay Cooney confirmed the comments. After news of the interview, Ford shares rose 1.3 percent in extended trade, while Microsoft shares fell 1.1 percent.Several prominent Microsoft investors had campaigned behind the scenes for Mulally to succeed Ballmer. But one source familiar with Microsoft's board's discussions said Mulally's candidacy raised questions about ""culture and leadership style"".Mulally's apparent interest in the job attracted considerable media attention that overshadowed Ford's product-related announcements, such as the roll-out of the new Mustang, something that frustrated Ford's board of directors, people familiar with the matter said.",2014-01-08,MSFT,"Tue Jan 7, 2014 | 8:13pm EST","UPDATE 3-Microsoft close to naming CEO, Ford's Mulally stays put",http://www.reuters.com//article/autos-ford-ceo-idUSL2N0KH2B320140108?type=companyNews,0.8698,0.052,0.864,0.084
18,"   By Bill Rigby and Christian Plumb | SEATTLE/NEW YORK  SEATTLE/NEW YORK Speculation over Microsoft Corp's succession plans refocused on internal choices on Wednesday, a day after the leading outside candidate, Ford Motor Co CEO Alan Mulally, took himself off the list of potential CEOs at the world's largest software maker.A source close to the company said no appointment was likely until the last week of January or in February. The source asked not be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the process to select a successor to long-time CEO Steve Ballmer, who in August announced his plan to retire.In late January, many Microsoft executives will be focused on the company's earnings, which are scheduled to be released on January 23. Also, chairman Bill Gates, a key member of the search committee, will be at the World Economic Forum in Davos.For months, Microsoft watchers had pegged Mulally as the odds-on bet to succeed Ballmer as chief executive at the dominant producer of software for desktops and laptops, which has faltered in making the transition to the fast-growing mobile phone and tablet markets.But Mulally formally pulled out of the running on Tuesday, telling the Associated Press he would remain at Ford through 2014.It was unclear whether Mulally's withdrawal from consideration was his decision or Microsoft's. While the company's intentions remained a guessing game, internal candidates now seemed the obvious ones, especially in light of comments by Microsoft about the importance of tech know-how for the top job.Mulally appeared to be the front runner in the latter part of last year and seemed to be interested in the job, but Microsoft never made him an offer, suggesting that the prevailing mood on the company's board was that he was not right for the job, two sources familiar with the process said. The sources have also told Reuters that Microsoft is down to a ""handful"" of candidates, including insiders Satya Nadella, executive vice president of the Cloud & Enterprise group and Tony Bates, executive vice president of Business Development and Evangelism.Former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop, a Microsoft veteran before moving to Nokia, whose mobile phone business Microsoft bought last year, has also been cited as a top candidate, as have one or more outsiders from the tech industry.As a former Microsoft executive who will soon rejoin the company when the takeover is complete, Elop was mentioned as now ""front and center"" of the CEO race in a research note from FBR analyst Daniel Ives, who cited his ""previous Microsoft experience and demonstrable expertise in the mobile space."" Evercore analyst Kirk Materne saw it differently, naming Nadella and Bates as the leading internal candidates who ""could potentially institute organizational change at a more rapid pace given their insider status.""Microsoft shares, which have gained 36 percent over the past year, were down 1.2 percent, while Ford shares gained about the same amount.'DARK HORSE' IN THE RUNNING?

23,"   By Chang-Ran Kim | TOKYO  TOKYO Nintendo Co Ltd said on Friday that sales of its Wii U consoles had flopped, pushing it to a third consecutive annual loss and raising a question mark over its future in a home console market increasingly dominated by Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp.The company that got its start making playing cards more than a century ago slashed its global Wii U sales forecast for the year to March 31 by almost 70 percent to 2.8 million units. It cut its sales forecast for its handheld 3DS to 13.5 million units from 18 million. The Wii U is the successor to its hit Wii console.Nintendo's president, Satoru Iwata, who last year pledged to return the hobbled game maker to profit this business year, apologized to shareholders at a briefing in Osaka, but said his failure to fulfill his promise did not mean he had to resign.""There will be no major management shake-up in the short term,"" Iwata told reporters.Pressure will likely mount on the architect of the Wii success in 2006 to step aside or shift course to focus on making money from ""Super Mario"" and other software titles. Nintendo so far has refused to allow its games to be played on machines built by competitors or on tablets or other mobile devices that are used by gamers. In the past the company has blamed a lack of titles for poor sales, but even its popular family-friendly games are losing out on sales to more hard-core titles like ""Grand Theft Auto"" played on rival machines.""The fact that the 'Wii U strategy' has failed is disappointing and will likely trigger a sell-off as soon as the market opens,"" said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management.Nintendo this business year now expects an operating loss of 35 billion yen ($335.76 million) compared with an initial forecast for a 100 billion yen profit. The new estimate also falls drastically short of the average forecast of a 54.7 billion yen profit in a survey of 18 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The latest warning comes just three months after the Japanese company reiterated its sales projections for the Wii U, counting on the console to revive its fortunes as Microsoft released its new XBox One and Sony released its PlayStation 4 to the public.""We failed to reach our target for hardware sales during the year-end, when revenues are the highest,"" said Iwata. In 2006, Iwata was celebrated worldwide after creating a new niche with the Wii console designed for the whole family to use rather than hardcore gamers. That success boosted Nintendo's cash pile to around $14 billion, money it will have to dip into again to help cover its latest deficit.Nintendo on Friday also warned of a net loss of 25 billion yen for the year ending on March 31, a substantial reversal from its prior projection of a 55 billion yen profit. It now expects revenues of 590 billion yen, down 36 percent from its prior forecast. It cut its full-year dividend to 100 yen from 260 yen.Nintendo shares have fallen almost 10 percent since hitting a two-and-a-half year high of 15,880 yen on January 10. The stock climbed 55 percent in 2013, in line with a 57 percent rally by the benchmark Nikkei average but underperforming a 91 percent surge by rival Sony.($1 = 104.2400 Japanese yen)(Additional reporting by Ayai Tomisawa, Dominic Lau and Reiji Murai; Writing by Tim Kelly; Editing by Edmund Klamann and Matt Driskill)",2014-01-17,MSFT,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 4:07am EST",Nintendo heads for third consecutive annual loss as Wii U flops,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-nintendo-earnings-idUSBREA0G09M20140117?type=companyNews,0.9794,0.092,0.776,0.132
24,"   By Ritsuko Ando | HELSINKI  HELSINKI Nokia is expected to show a steep fall in network equipment sales in its results this week, highlighting the challenge facing management after selling its once mighty handset division to Microsoft for 5.4 billion euros ($7.3 billion).Improved profitability at Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN) due to cost cutting have helped cushion the company's declining handset business in recent quarters.But with major projects in South Korea and Japan coming to an end, the NSN business, the bulk of Nokia's entire business after the handsets sale, is expected to report a 19 percent fall in fourth-quarter sales to 3.2 billion euros and a 17 percent fall for the whole of 2013 to 11.4 billion euros. Results are due on Thursday.The decline for NSN would follow a 26 percent fall in third-quarter sales and come as scale has become increasingly crucial to competing against the industry leader for wireless networks, Ericsson, and China's Huawei, particularly due to high research and development costs.NSN's chief Rajeev Suri, in an interview with Reuters in November, confirmed the company was now prioritizing revenue growth even if it meant a trade-off in profit.Analysts said NSN must demonstrate that shift in coming quarters, and that markets will accept a dip in margins as long as they don't fall too far below 8 to 10 percent.NSN's fourth-quarter adjusted operating margin is still likely to be high. The company forecast it will be around 12 percent, plus or minus 4 percentage points, compared with 8 percent in the third quarter.That's higher than most rivals such as Ericsson, which reported an 8 percent operating margin last quarter as NSN's restructuring program launched in late 2011 cut a quarter of its workforce and took the business out of low-margin projects. ""It is possible that we won't be seeing such high margins this year, but I'd rather see them starting to grow again,"" said Inderes Equity Research analyst Mikael Rautanen.Nordea Markets analyst Sami Sarkamies said Nokia's challenge will be to find new business to make up for a decline in sales in Asia, where a year ago it was busy building out high-speed wireless broadband networks. Asia, including Greater China, accounted for around 41 percent of NSN's 2.59 billion sales in the third quarter.That won't be easy. While telecoms operators are expected to spend more on network equipment in 2014 due to strong demand for high-speed 4G mobile broadband technology, competition is set to remain fierce.MANAGING WITHOUT PHONES Analysts expect Nokia's results this week to also show a fall in its handset shipments. Quarterly smartphone shipments are expected to have risen 53 percent from a year earlier to 10.7 million while still lagging behind market leaders Samsung and Apple. But results from the handset business, where revenues last year were estimated to have fallen by 26 percent to 11.6 billion euros, will be counted as discontinued operations, with the Microsoft deal expected to close shortly, pending regulatory approvals in China.That leaves Nokia investors to focus on how Nokia will operate the rump business and how much of the sale proceeds will be reinvested or paid out to shareholders. Company sources said last week that the board was still finalizing details of Nokia's new structure and leadership.NSN's Suri is widely seen as a leading contender for the CEO role, with investors happy with his track record of having turned NSN around.Some sources familiar with recent talks, however, said Nokia's CFO and interim president Timo Ihamuotila is also a top candidate, favored by those who see a future in Nokia's HERE navigation software and its store of technology patents. Those businesses will account for just 10 percent of the new company's sales, with the rest coming from NSN, but some believe they could be used to help turn Nokia into a patent powerhouse or develop wireless services of the future.As CFO, Ihamuotila has gained experience in mergers and acquisitions, which could prove useful if Nokia decides to sell parts of the remaining business such as HERE.ALCATEL LUCENT Analysts, however, see the most likely deal for Nokia as a tie-up with struggling rival Alcatel Lucent. Suri played down the likelihood of such a deal in November, but analysts say it could help NSN compete more effectively against Ericsson as well as Chinese rivals Huawei and ZTE.""Nokia clearly would have a great opportunity to improve NSN's position with the acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent's wireless division,"" Bernstein analyst Pierre Ferragu said in a research note.($1=0.7376 euros)(Corrects spelling of 'cushion' in second paragraph and 'business' in paragraph 10)(Editing by Greg Mahlich)",2014-01-20,MSFT,"Mon Jan 20, 2014 | 11:13am EST",Phone-free Nokia under pressure to boost network sales,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-nokia-idUSBREA0J11X20140120?type=companyNews,0.9945,0.022,0.888,0.09
25,"  Microsoft is expected to report higher second-quarter sales, but an 8 percent dip in profit as Windows 8, the Surface tablet and the new Xbox console had an unspectacular holiday shopping season. Investors will hope to hear more on the company's meandering search for a new chief executive, which most had expected to be completed by now, after Steve Ballmer's retirement plan was announced in August. The company will report results after market close.  The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits likely held steady in the week ended Jan. 18, after falling for three consecutive weeks. The Labor Department is expected to report that initial claims held at a seasonally adjusted 326,000, the same as the prior week. (0830/1330)  Data is expected to show that U.S. home re-sales rose in December after a drop in November. The National Association of Realtors is expected to announce that existing home sales rose 2 percent to an annual rate of 4.94 million units from the prior month's 4.90 million units. (1000/1500)  Investors are not expecting much good news when McDonald reports fourth-quarter results before the market opens. The fast-food giant's sales are virtually stuck in neutral as recent menu introductions such as Mighty Wings have fallen flat and service times have slowed due to the broad array of offerings on its menu.  Starbucks reports first-quarter results after market close. After two quarters of strong sales and traffic momentum, some analysts are concerned that the coffee chain's new and improved pastries are slowing service because baristas are taking time to warm them up.  Lockheed Martin is expected to report higher fourth-quarter earnings despite a drop in revenue. Lockheed's biggest program, the F-35 fighter, appears to have survived the 2014 budget process, but company officials will face questions about the Littoral Combat Ship amid reports that the Pentagon could scale back total orders.  Southwest Airlines is expected to report higher fourth-quarter results. The discount airline raised luggage fees at its AirTran unit and launched new fees tied to certain boarding positions at the gate to raise revenue. The carrier recently bought gates at New York's LaGuardia Airport. Investors will be looking for commentary on its outlook.  United Continental reports fourth-quarter earnings. Its stock has risen about 25 percent since the start of the year, and the company has already said December unit revenue rose. United, once the biggest airline in the world, also said capacity in the quarter is expected to rise almost 3 percent, and traffic is supposed to be higher too.  U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, Trade Representative Michael Froman and Commerce Secretary Penney Pritzker are scheduled to participate in a panel discussion on the U.S. economic outlook at the World Economic Forum in Davos.  When Union Pacific, the largest publicly traded U.S. railroad reports fourth-quarter results, all eyes will be on coal volume shipments and updates on any bad-weather related hits to the quarter. The company has already said it does not expect pricing gains this year to match those of 2013. In the third quarter, Union Pacific had talked about retailers being wary of placing orders. Updates are expected on whether order volumes were below expectations.  Juniper Networks' fourth-quarter results are likely to beat estimates, according to StarMine, helped by renewed growth in its core router/switch market following orders from Verizon. Juniper is also expected to strong first-quarter earnings as U.S. companies spend more on network equipment products.  Programmable chipmaker Altera Corp's fourth-quarter results are likely to miss analysts' expectations, according to StarMine. Analysts say the company last year lagged rival Xilinx's entry into the 28 nanometer chip market. Results could be affected by its biggest customer, technology distributor Arrow Electronics, which forecast mid-single digit sequential declines in its chip segment. Other companies that are also reporting quarterly results include Maxim Integrated Products, Informatica and Synaptics.  Discover Financial's fourth-quarter results are expected to ride on improving default rates and growth in consumer spending. Discount brokerage firm E*Trade Financial, still recovering from its life-threatening plunge into making mortgages through its bank, reports fourth-quarter results after market closes.  Mexican annual inflation likely rose in early January at its fastest pace since early May due to an uptick in fuel prices and a hike in taxes on soft drinks and junk food, but the central bank has said it expects the spike to be temporary. A Reuters poll forecast that consumer prices rose 0.69 percent in the first half of the month. Core consumer prices, which exclude some volatile food and energy prices, were seen rising 0.64 percent. (0900/1400)  Brazil's annual inflation rate probably eased slightly in the month to mid-January, offering little relief to policymakers even after a series of interest rate hikes aimed at reining in consumer prices. Statistics agency IBGE will release its mid-month inflation report (0600/1100), just half an hour after the central bank publishes the minutes of its latest monetary policy meeting.

26,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft Corp posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by strong sales of its Office software to businesses, a solid holiday season for its new Xbox game console and Surface tablets, and a slightly lower tax bill.The world's largest software company did not say anything about its unexpectedly long five-month search for a new chief executive to replace Steve Ballmer, who said in August he would retire within a year.The company co-founded by Bill Gates 39 years ago was central to the personal computer revolution, but lost its way in the last decade under Ballmer as Apple Inc and Google Inc stormed ahead in mobile computing.The quarter may well be the last full one for Ballmer, and it at least showed some positive momentum for the Surface tablet, Microsoft's long-delayed attempt to knock Apple's iPad off its perch.""It's a good print to ride off into the sunset with, for the current CEO,"" said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. ""There's still the over-arching question for this company: who's going to be the new CEO, and what direction they take.""

27,"  By Bill RigbySEATTLE Jan 23 Microsoft Corp posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by strong sales of its Office software to businesses, a solid holiday season for its new Xbox game console and Surface tablets, and a slightly lower tax bill.The world's largest software company did not say anything about its unexpectedly long five-month search for a new chief executive to replace Steve Ballmer, who said in August he would retire within a year.The company co-founded by Bill Gates 39 years ago was central to the personal computer revolution, but lost its way in the last decade under Ballmer as Apple Inc and Google Inc stormed ahead in mobile computing.The quarter may well be the last full one for Ballmer, and it at least showed some positive momentum for the Surface tablet, Microsoft's long-delayed attempt to knock Apple's iPad off its perch. ""It's a good print to ride off into the sunset with, for the current CEO,"" said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Financial. ""There's still the over-arching question for this company: who's going to be the new CEO, and what direction they take.""Microsoft's new Xbox One console, launched in November, helped the top line, contributing more than half to the 7.4 million unit sales in the quarter, up from 5.9 million a year ago.

Trading volume was heavier than in recent sessions.The market sentiment was dented by a report on manufacturing in China which showed a mild slowdown at the end of 2013 in the world's second-largest economy had continued into the new year.

Both on the NYSE and Nasdaq, decliners beat advancers by a ratio of about 2 to 1.

31,"   By Ritsuko Ando | HELSINKI  HELSINKI Nokia has reported a steep fall in sales at its network equipment division, raising concerns about growth prospects for what will be its primary operation after selling its former flagship phone business to Microsoft.The Nokia Solutions and Networks (NSN) division's fourth-quarter sales fell 22 percent from a year earlier to 3.1 billion euros ($4.2 billion) as it failed to make up for the completion of large-scale Asian projects and withdrawal from some low-margin businesses earlier in the year.Meanwhile sales in the Devices and Services division which it is selling to Microsoft for 5.4 billion euros ($7.4 billion) fell 29 percent to around 2.6 billion euros as it struggled with""competitive industry dynamics"".Nokia's shares were down 10 percent at 5.15 euros by 1600 GMT (11:00 ET), a gain of more than 70 percent since the MicrosfMicrosoftt deal was announced in September, and analysts said much of the sell-off was due to worries about NSN, which will account for around 90 percent of Nokia's sales after the Microsoft deal is completed later this quarter.Analysts had on average forecast sales of 3.2 billion euros, according to a Reuters poll.""The fourth quarter was slightly disappointing,"" said Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen. ""Minus 22 percent was a heavier decline than was expected.""The unit turned profitable in 2012 after slashing costs and shedding unprofitable business but analysts say management now needs to concentrate on winning more work as high research and development costs mean bigger players have an advantage.""They have cut costs and made profits for several quarters, but it's important that sales stabilize and grow in the second half of this year."" said Greger Johansson at research firm Redeye. Nokia duly said it would make an aggressive push this year to gain market share against industry leader Ericsson as well as Chinese rival Huawei, and is aiming for year-on-year sales growth in the second half.NSN's chief executive Rajeev Suri said it would be helped by recent deals with carriers such as Sprint in the United States and China Mobile.""We are not satisfied with our top line results,"" he told analysts on a conference call, saying the company would be more ""assertive"" in winning deals.However, analysts expect such sales growth will come at the expense of margins. NSN's operating margin last year rose to 9.7 percent from 5.7 percent in 2012.The margin in the first quarter was likely to fall to around 5 percent, the company said, but it expects the year result to be at the higher end of its long-term range of 5-10 percent. JP Morgan said it found the year forecast reassuring and kept an ""overweight"" rating on Nokia's shares but Nordea reiterated a ""sell"" recommendation, saying the company's forecast of 600 million euros in patent income for 2014 was much lower than he expected.DROPPING PHONES However, the overall results showed the group in stronger financial health without the phone business, which reported an adjusted operating loss of 191 million euros in the fourth quarter.""The Microsoft deal looks only better and better for Nokia. If they still had that business in their books, their share price would be below two euros,"" said Mika Heikkila, portfolio manager at Taaleritehdas Asset Management.Shipments of Lumia smartphones, which run on Windows Phone software, fell to 8.2 million devices in the last three months, from 8.8 million in the previous quarter, showing they failed to win over consumers in the crucial holiday season, and Nokia said the average sales price for its phones fell. That shows the difficulties Microsoft will face in breaking into a market which apart from Apple is now dominated by phones running on Google's Android operating system.Nokia's former chief executive Stephen Elop made the controversial decision to adopt Windows Phone in an attempt to recover from a late start in smartphones. But a limited marketing budget and an initial lack of popular apps made it hard for Nokia's smartphones to catch up.It launched a wide range of handsets last year, winning positive reviews from critics, but by then investors were growing increasingly concerned about the company's finances.Completion of the Microsoft sale is expected to return Nokia to an investment-grade credit rating while still allowing it to return some of the cash proceeds to shareholders.Nokia last year suspended its annual dividend for the first time in its 148-year history in an attempt to preserve cash.But it said on Thursday that the board was still deliberating on the company's corporate and capital structure and on how much of the Microsoft cash would be paid out to shareholders.""Investors are left cold here.

42,"   By Sophie Knight and Reiji  Murai | TOKYO  TOKYO Jan 28 Nintendo Co Ltd, facing a third year of losses, is getting lots of unsolicited advice on how to squeeze more out of its Mario franchise and revive its fortunes after admitting that its Wii U game console has been a flop.The company has given few clues on its new management strategy, due to be announced on Thursday. One thing, however, is certain - it will have to burn through a lot of its cash pile in the years it takes to try again with the Wii U's successor.The Nintendo that emerges could well be a more efficient company - better at marketing its beloved characters, but still wedded to its basic strategy of making hardware as the vehicle for software developed in-house.Most analysts do not expect a bolder change of direction, such as making its back catalogue available via an online subscription service or allowing its games to be played on smartphones - despite some saying they are the future of gaming.The Kyoto-based company has been slow to move online, falling behind Microsoft Corp and Sony Corp, which will launch a cloud-based streaming service this summer enabling users to play the same game across numerous platforms.Taking Mario to the cloud would be a big step for conservative Nintendo.""Online is big and Nintendo is notorious for not having a great online system,"" said Jean Snow, a Tokyo-based gaming expert.The company faces no imminent existential danger. With 850 billion yen ($8.3 billion) in cash and its own shares at the end of last September it can survive a few years of losses.That cash pile was amassed from past hits such as the first Wii - evidence, say some, that a company with its history of booms and busts has the ability to turn things around once more.""Nintendo is a special thing, because of its history, so many gamers have a soft spot for Nintendo... they just shot themselves in the foot with this piece of hardware, the Wii U,"" said Snow. ""But I totally think they can get out."" WII U FAILURE The failure of the Wii U - whose annual sales forecast was slashed by 70 percent earlier this month - leaves Nintendo as the loser of the pack now led by Sony and Microsoft.Analysts say the Wii U foundered because too few games were released for the console, with development issues leading to a delay of more than six months between the games released at the launch in November 2012 and the next batch of titles.""There's no software that is made especially for the Wii U. If there were fun games that you couldn't play on anything else then that would be something to talk about,"" said Eiji Maeda, an analyst at SMBC Nikko. It was the sports and fitness games introduced with Nintendo's previous console, the Wii, that made it a runaway hit as their use of the console's unique motion sensor controllers drew in families and video games newbies.But those casual gamers have been unconvinced of the need to upgrade to a console whose name and concept seems so close to its predecessor, while core gamers hanker for the more adult games, higher processing power and connectivity offered by Sony's Playstation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One.Although Nintendo CEO Satoru Iwata said that sales of the Wii U would pick up as more titles are released, there are few cases of a console becoming a hit after a slow start. Third party developers are also less likely to want to make games for a failing console.Nintendo has survived misses amid its hits before. It weathered the blow to the games industry from the collapse of rival Atari, scoring a hit with its Nintendo Entertainment System, and later won a battle for dominance against Sega.Nintendo's Gamecube console, released in 2001, stumbled against Sony's PlayStation 2 and Microsoft's Xbox.

60,"  By Nadia Damouni and Bill RigbyNEW YORK/SEATTLE Jan 30 Microsoft Corp  is likely to appoint its cloud-computing head, Satya Nadella, as its next chief executive, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday, as the board concludes a five-month search for a tech-savvy heavy-hitter to lead the world's largest software company.As part of the move, co-founder Bill Gates may step aside as chairman and be replaced by lead independent director John Thompson, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because the process is private. Gates would remain a director, the source added.Bloomberg first reported the news on Thursday.Rising star Nadella, a native of Hyderabad, India - where Microsoft has its largest non-U.S. research center - was promoted to run the company's fast-expanding cloud, or internet-based, computing initiatives in July last year as part of current CEO Steve Ballmer's radical re-organization of the company.The appointment of the 22-year Microsoft veteran would make him the most powerful Indian-born tech executive in the world and put him alongside PepsiCo Inc's chief, Indra Nooyi, as the leader of a well-known, large-cap U.S. corporation.Born in 1967 and educated in India and the United States, Nadella's tech career started at internet software pioneer Sun Microsystems. He joined Microsoft in 1992 and quickly climbed the corporate ladder with leading roles in the Office and Bing search-engine teams.He was promoted to run the company's server and tools unit in 2011. That unit now forms the backbone of Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, which Nadella runs under his official title of executive vice president, cloud and enterprise.""He's a solid choice,"" offering continuity of strategy and proven execution, said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen. Some investors had campaigned for an external CEO who might be more likely to shake up the company and reward shareholders with greater dividends and share buybacks, but Parakh said that did not mean Nadella would be unpopular with Wall Street.""Any new CEO is going to have to have the shareholders' say in mind. But it's not certain that will translate into actions,"" said Parakh.If Nadella is named CEO, it is likely Thompson will help out on the crucial task of managing Microsoft's relations with its powerful Wall Street investors, the source said.Nadella has little experience of that aspect of the job, and Ballmer and Gates did not prioritize it. Gates would likely focus on technical innovation in any new role, the source said. There have been calls for months for Gates to step down from investors who believe Microsoft's co-founder is a block to radical change and investor-friendly moves.Ballmer, who plans to retire as soon as a new CEO is named, was reelected to the board in November, but it is not clear how long he will remain there after retirement, the source said.Several people briefed on the CEO search process had previously told Reuters that Microsoft was down to a handful of candidates, including Nadella and Tony Bates, executive vice-president of business development, plus at least one external candidate.The board still has not met to finalize Nadella's offer and nothing has been signed, the source said. Microsoft declined to comment.Microsoft shares rose 0.8 percent to $37.15 after hours, after gaining slightly in regular Nasdaq trading. LONG SEARCH Microsoft's CEO search has taken longer than most expected when Ballmer said last August he would retire within a year.In a blog post on the company's website in December, Thompson emphasized the need for a CEO with ""an ability to lead a highly technical organization and work with top technical talent"".Thompson, who leads the four-member CEO search committee, said at the time he expected the panel to reach a decision ""in the early part of 2014"".The appointment of a company veteran like Nadella, which follows a flirtation with outsiders such as Ford Motor Co  Chief Executive Alan Mulally, could disappoint some investors who want a more radical transformation at the software giant.""While many on the Street are now expecting Mr. Nadella to get the CEO spot, we believe filling this position with a core Microsoft insider will disappoint those hoping for a fresh strategic approach (e.g. potential breakup of enterprise/consumer, Xbox spin off) an outside executive could have brought to the table,"" FBR analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note, adding that innovation and fresh strategies were needed.""With that said, we believe Mr. Nadella's prior roles in the Online Services Division, Business Division and most recently as president of the Server and Tools business position him as a strong internal candidate with a broad set of knowledge around Microsoft's massive product portfolio,"" Ives wrote.",2014-01-31,MSFT,"Thu Jan 30, 2014 | 9:38pm EST",UPDATE 4-Microsoft board close to naming Nadella as new CEO - source,http://www.reuters.com//article/microsoft-ceo-idUSL2N0L42EV20140131?type=companyNews,0.991,0.022,0.895,0.082

62,"  WASHINGTON Feb 3 The Federal Communications Commission, doubling its investment in high-speed Internet at schools, on Monday pledged an additional $2 billion over two years for improving broadband networks in schools and libraries.The investment comes through E-Rate, a subsidy program funded by fees Americans pay on their monthly phone bills that helps schools and libraries get discounts on Internet services and digital devices.Created in 1996, E-Rate has been giving schools around $2.4 billion a year. But demand has far exceeded that amount, FCC officials have said, and of all E-Rate funding, only about half has gone toward equipping schools and libraries with true high-speed Internet access, the agency said.In what FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler called a ""business-like approach,"" the agency would reshuffle how it spends the current E-Rate funds to prioritize high-capacity Internet connections over other purposes and to improve the program's efficiency and management. While most experts agree on the benefits and the need to modernize E-Rate, opinions have differed on how to fund the changes.At first the additional funds will come from unused money from previous years, the FCC said in detailing its plans to boost spending on high-speed Internet. Later, funds would come from reforms the FCC is considering for the E-Rate program, such as no longer paying for outdated technologies, including paging or dial-up Internet. The effort is part of President Barack Obama's push to connect 99 percent of U.S. schools to high-speed broadband and wireless Internet within five years to spur use of digital technology in the classrooms.Nearly all U.S. schools have access to basic Internet, the FCC said, but the speed and quality at many is far from ideal. The new funds would be targeted toward ""the most urgent Internet upgrade needs,"" the agency said. The FCC said its increased investment in high-speed Internet will connect 20 million students at 15,000 schools. Wheeler is expected to address the changes further in a speech later this week.The White House is working with companies such as tech giants Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, and wireless providers Sprint Corp and Verizon Communications Inc on other ways to improve digital experiences in American schools.Schools and libraries are clamoring for faster Internet speeds to promote digital learning, which has been shown to improve test scores and graduation rates.",2014-02-03,MSFT,"Mon Feb 3, 2014 | 5:32pm EST",U.S. boosting investment in high-speed Internet in schools by $2 bln,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-fcc-erate-idUSL2N0L81LD20140203?type=companyNews,0.9841,0.01,0.895,0.094
63,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft Corp is betting a mix of old and young blood will revive the aging technology pioneer, but new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella may find it tough to push change with co-founder Bill Gates and former CEO Steve Ballmer breathing down his neck.The 46-year-old India native and former enterprise business chief takes on the monumental task of exploring new directions - but with Gates as his consigliere, and on a strategy that Ballmer orchestrated with the board.That uphill endeavor helped sour other candidates on the job, including proven change agent Alan Mulally at Ford Motor Co, sources have said.Gates is giving up the board chairmanship to fellow director John Thompson. That, plus Nadella's promotion, marks a changing of the guard at a 39-year-old company that fueled the PC revolution, but is struggling with its longer-term identity after missing the boat on the mobile computing revolution.""You've got a triumvirate running the company: Satya as the new CEO, Bill as the product adviser and John Thompson running the board. A lot depends on how the three of them get along,"" said Bill George, Harvard Business School professor and former Medtronic Inc CEO.""The big question I have is, is Satya really going to be allowed to make the transformative changes that Microsoft needs to make, both at the product level and at the people level?""Microsoft shares closed 0.4 percent lower at $36.35 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday.The new Microsoft focuses on ""devices and services"" rather than licensing software, and seeks to emulate Apple's success in marrying popular online services with attractive gadgets.Set by the retiring Ballmer last year, that vision has proven unpopular with investors hoping either that Microsoft will stop plowing billions into mobile devices - as it is doing with its Nokia acquisition - or come up with new products to take on mobile leaders Apple Inc and Google Inc.""From a bigger-picture perspective, I don't think much is going to change,"" said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen. ""The strategy that was put in place in 2013 is where the company is headed.""On Tuesday, Gates - who may again become a regular sight around Microsoft's Redmond, Washington, campus after pledging to spend a third of his time as the new CEO's adviser - stressed that Nadella's cloud computing expertise qualified him to lead Microsoft into the new arena of mobile computing. ""Satya's got the right background to lead the company during this era,"" he said. ""There's a challenge in mobile computing. There's an opportunity in the cloud.""Nadella got a rich pay rise on his promotion, with a salary of $1.2 million, a maximum annual cash bonus of three times that and a stock award of $13.2 million for next fiscal year.That is much more than the moderately paid Ballmer, who took home less than $1.3 million last year, chiefly because of his refusal to take stock awards, which he deemed unnecessary given his ownership of $12 billion worth of Microsoft shares.Nadella's pay is modest in comparison to tech superstar Marissa Mayer, who got a compensation package that could total more than $70 million when she took the helm at Yahoo Inc two years ago.PROS, CONS The online element may play to the strengths of Nadella, who led the creation of Microsoft's Internet, or cloud, services.

""Every software company has to engineer this shift to software as a service, because 10 years from now there'll be no such thing as a licensed piece of software.""Nadella is only its third CEO in 39 years, taking over from Ballmer, who inherited the job from Gates in 2000. His appointment ends a five-month search process triggered by the August announcement of Ballmer's decision to retire.That was longer than many investors had expected.""It's a relief this process is over,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.

Gates, 58, left day-to-day work at Microsoft in 2008 to focus on philanthropy at his Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which he says is still his main job. He owns 4.3 percent of Microsoft's outstanding shares.""Satya's asked me to step up, substantially increasing the time that I spend at the company,"" Gates said in a video statement. ""I'll have over a third of my time available to meet with product groups.

71,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE As Microsoft Corp prepares to unveil insider Satya Nadella as its new chief executive, investors and analysts are weighing how effective the 22-year veteran will be in re-igniting the company's mobile ambitions and satisfying Wall Street's hunger for cash.The world's biggest software firm faces a slow erosion of its PC-centric Windows and Office franchises and needs to somehow challenge Apple Inc and Google Inc in the new realm of mobile computing. At the same time, some investors are campaigning for retrenchment and a bigger cut of the company's massive cash pile.Most agree that Nadella's background in creating Microsoft's Internet-based - or 'cloud' - computing services makes him a safe pair of hands to take the company forward, but there remains a question over his ability to make Microsoft a hit with consumers, or with impatient shareholders.""He is the right person to drive safe, right down the middle of the fairway, and continue Microsoft's strengths,"" said Rajeev Chand, managing director and head of research at tech investment bank Rutberg & Co. ""What we don't know is will Nadella help with the consumer revival, or with the mobile revival. Mobile is an open hole in his background.""Microsoft's problem is stark. More than 90 percent of PCs run Windows, but only 4 percent of smartphones do and an even smaller slice of tablets.The company is still the undisputed king of workplace computing, but it is finding it hard to kindle the affections of consumers at home and on the move. Its Surface devices had some success over the holiday shopping season, but its phones are showing signs of losing momentum.""I would advise him (Nadella) to take a fresh look at mobile, or bring in some talent who really understands the space,"" said David Smith, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner. Last July, CEO Steve Ballmer outlined Microsoft's new devices and services business model that is intended to marry cloud services with nifty gadgets that can challenge Android phones and Apple's iPad. He backed that up with the $7.2 billion purchase of handset maker Nokia, set to close this quarter.But that move did not play well on Wall Street and now Microsoft finds itself under pressure from critical investors to give up the hardware business and concentrate instead on getting its software onto as many devices as possible, including the iPad.""Microsoft has to be present on every device. They can't be captive to Windows or Windows Phone,"" said Ted Schadler, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. ""When you look at the applications that are on the rise to support mobile, it is not Microsoft with Word, it's Dropbox or Evernote. It's really about being everywhere.""One analyst calculated that Microsoft is losing $2.5 billion a year by keeping a full, native version of its Office suite unavailable for iPad users in the hope that its Surface tablets will become a hit with businesses, but there's no sign of that happening. ""They have to port Office to iPad, they have to do it,"" said Schadler.

72,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Feb 3 As Microsoft Corp  prepares to unveil insider Satya Nadella as its new chief executive, investors and analysts are weighing how effective the 22-year veteran will be in re-igniting the company's mobile ambitions and satisfying Wall Street's hunger for cash.The world's biggest software firm faces a slow erosion of its PC-centric Windows and Office franchises and needs to somehow challenge Apple Inc and Google Inc in the new realm of mobile computing. At the same time, some investors are campaigning for retrenchment and a bigger cut of the company's massive cash pile.Most agree that Nadella's background in creating Microsoft's Internet-based - or 'cloud' - computing services makes him a safe pair of hands to take the company forward, but there remains a question over his ability to make Microsoft a hit with consumers, or with impatient shareholders.""He is the right person to drive safe, right down the middle of the fairway, and continue Microsoft's strengths,"" said Rajeev Chand, managing director and head of research at tech investment bank Rutberg & Co. ""What we don't know is will Nadella help with the consumer revival, or with the mobile revival. Mobile is an open hole in his background.""Microsoft's problem is stark. More than 90 percent of PCs run Windows, but only 4 percent of smartphones do and an even smaller slice of tablets.The company is still the undisputed king of workplace computing, but it is finding it hard to kindle the affections of consumers at home and on the move. Its Surface devices had some success over the holiday shopping season, but its phones are showing signs of losing momentum.""I would advise him (Nadella) to take a fresh look at mobile, or bring in some talent who really understands the space,"" said David Smith, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner.Last July, CEO Steve Ballmer outlined Microsoft's new devices and services business model that is intended to marry cloud services with nifty gadgets that can challenge Android phones and Apple's iPad. He backed that up with the $7.2 billion purchase of handset maker Nokia, set to close this quarter. But that move did not play well on Wall Street and now Microsoft finds itself under pressure from critical investors to give up the hardware business and concentrate instead on getting its software onto as many devices as possible, including the iPad.""Microsoft has to be present on every device. They can't be captive to Windows or Windows Phone,"" said Ted Schadler, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. ""When you look at the applications that are on the rise to support mobile, it is not Microsoft with Word, it's Dropbox or Evernote. Its really about being everywhere.""One analyst calculated that Microsoft is losing $2.5 billion a year by keeping a full, native version of its Office suite unavailable for iPad users in the hope that its Surface tablets will become a hit with businesses, but there's no sign of that happening.""They have to port Office to iPad, they have to do it,"" said Schadler. ""That's an important, immediate decision that Satya's going to have to drive.""

73,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft Corp is betting a mix of old and young blood will revive the aging technology pioneer, but new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella may find it tough to push change with co-founder Bill Gates and former CEO Steve Ballmer breathing down his neck.The 46-year-old India native and former enterprise business chief takes on the monumental task of exploring new directions - but with Gates as his consigliere, and on a strategy that Ballmer orchestrated with the board.That uphill endeavor helped sour other candidates on the job, including proven change agent Alan Mulally at Ford Motor Co, sources have said.Gates is giving up the board chairmanship to fellow director John Thompson. That, plus Nadella's promotion, marks a changing of the guard at a 39-year-old company that fueled the PC revolution, but is struggling with its longer-term identity after missing the boat on the mobile computing revolution.""You've got a triumvirate running the company: Satya as the new CEO, Bill as the product adviser and John Thompson running the board. A lot depends on how the three of them get along,"" said Bill George, Harvard Business School professor and former Medtronic Inc CEO.""The big question I have is, is Satya really going to be allowed to make the transformative changes that Microsoft needs to make, both at the product level and at the people level?""Microsoft shares closed 0.4 percent lower at $36.35 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday.The new Microsoft focuses on ""devices and services"" rather than licensing software, and seeks to emulate Apple's success in marrying popular online services with attractive gadgets.Set by the retiring Ballmer last year, that vision has proven unpopular with investors hoping either that Microsoft will stop plowing billions into mobile devices - as it is doing with its Nokia acquisition - or come up with new products to take on mobile leaders Apple Inc and Google Inc.""From a bigger-picture perspective, I don't think much is going to change,"" said Sid Parakh, an analyst at fund firm McAdams Wright Ragen. ""The strategy that was put in place in 2013 is where the company is headed.""On Tuesday, Gates - who may again become a regular sight around Microsoft's Redmond, Washington, campus after pledging to spend a third of his time as the new CEO's adviser - stressed that Nadella's cloud computing expertise qualified him to lead Microsoft into the new arena of mobile computing. ""Satya's got the right background to lead the company during this era,"" he said. ""There's a challenge in mobile computing. There's an opportunity in the cloud.""Nadella got a rich pay rise on his promotion, with a salary of $1.2 million, a maximum annual cash bonus of three times that and a stock award of $13.2 million for next fiscal year.That is much more than the moderately paid Ballmer, who took home less than $1.3 million last year, chiefly because of his refusal to take stock awards, which he deemed unnecessary given his ownership of $12 billion worth of Microsoft shares.Nadella's pay is modest in comparison to tech superstar Marissa Mayer, who got a compensation package that could total more than $70 million when she took the helm at Yahoo Inc two years ago.PROS, CONS The online element may play to the strengths of Nadella, who led the creation of Microsoft's Internet, or cloud, services. Nadella has pushed the company in the direction of an Internet-based future, using its network of vast data centers to host products such as Office 365, a subscription-based online version of its ubiquitous business software.He ""bashed heads together on the product teams to get them to support cloud deployment in a consistent way,"" said Ted Schadler, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. ""Every software company has to engineer this shift to software as a service, because 10 years from now there'll be no such thing as a licensed piece of software.""Nadella is only its third CEO in 39 years, taking over from Ballmer, who inherited the job from Gates in 2000. His appointment ends a five-month search process triggered by the August announcement of Ballmer's decision to retire.That was longer than many investors had expected.""It's a relief this process is over,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""Many investors view it as the 'safe pick' as Mr. Nadella is a born-and-bred Redmond insider. But the uphill battle continues for Microsoft on its path to growth.""The move is also a significant shift for Gates, who along with Apple's Steve Jobs was one of the key forces who shaped the personal computer revolution of the late 20th century, making him an icon of the new information economy and the world's richest person in the process. Gates, 58, left day-to-day work at Microsoft in 2008 to focus on philanthropy at his Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which he says is still his main job. He owns 4.3 percent of Microsoft's outstanding shares.""Satya's asked me to step up, substantially increasing the time that I spend at the company,"" Gates said in a video statement. ""I'll have over a third of my time available to meet with product groups. It'll be fun to define this next round of products, working together.""Nadella, who describes himself as a cricket and poetry lover, called the appointment ""humbling"" in an email to employees. In a videotaped statement, he said he would focus on ""ruthlessly"" removing any obstacles to innovation.Apart from Ford Motor's Mulally, Nadella also beat out other candidates for the job. Several were close to the company, like Stephen Elop, set to rejoin Microsoft when its acquisition of Nokia's handset business closes, and Tony Bates, the former Skype boss now in charge of business development.Most agree that Nadella's background makes him a safe pair of hands to take the company forward, but there remains a question over his ability to make Microsoft a hit with consumers or with impatient shareholders.Even as Microsoft faces a slow erosion of its PC-centric Windows and Office franchises, some investors are campaigning for retrenchment and a bigger cut of the company's cash pile.ValueAct Capital, which led a shareholder revolt last year that culminated in Ballmer's retirement, has pushed for the company to abandon ambitions to be a hardware maker, focus on its strengths with business software and return more capital.That means refocusing on Office and Windows and distributing more of Microsoft's $84 billion in cash and short-term investments, though most of that is held overseas.Nadella's immediate task may be to balance the demands of long- and short-term investors.""That's a balance that John Thompson is going to provide,"" said Parakh.(Additional reporting by Thyagaraju Adinarayan; Writing by Christian Plumb; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Lisa Von Ahn, Matthew Lewis and Jonathan Oatis)",2014-02-05,MSFT,"Tue Feb 4, 2014 | 8:12pm EST","Microsoft hopes new, old leaders can rekindle magic",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-microsoft-succession-idUSBREA130VD20140205?type=companyNews,0.9976,0.033,0.872,0.095
74,"  By Jack ShaferFeb 7 About 20 years ago, Nathan Myhrvold, then Microsoft's chief technology officer, composed a 20,000-word piece of prophesy titled ""Road Kill on the Information Highway"" that reads as fresh today as it did then.One of many memos the polymath was churning out for Microsoft bossman Bill Gates at the time, ""Road Kill"" deserves our renewed attention for at least three reasons: 1) many of the market, media and tech dislocations Myhrvold predicted have come true, so he's owed credit for his sharpness; 2) the tech forces Myhrvold identified have continued their romp, making some of his come-true predictions even truer as time has passed; and 3) though Microsoft embraced much of his futurology at the time, it still missed the market in many places where companies like Google, Apple and Amazon hit.Rereading the memo, you feel a pang of sympathy for outgoing Microsoft chief executive officer Steve Ballmer, who has been criticized for not overtaking Google, for not inventing the iPhone, not creating Facebook, and other transgressions. You also feel 10 tons of trepidation for incoming CEO Satya Nadella, who faces the same tech market realities that blunted Ballmer. Myhrvold's memo, dated Sept. 8, 1993, repeatedly warns that computer speed and computer storage were to grow exponentially for decades, making the computers of the near future a million times fast and then a trillion times faster.Every tech know-it-all was harping on the mayhem Moore's law would unleash, but Myhrvold's essay made the coming revolution palpable. He wrote:It is extraordinarily difficult for people to really grasp the power of exponential growth. No experience in our everyday life prepares us for it. The numbers become so astronomically large so quickly...that it is easy to either dismiss them outright, or mentally glaze over and become numb to their meaning. It is incredibly easy to fool oneself into thinking that you do understand it, but usually this just means that you've mentally done a linear extrapolation from the recent past. This works for a little while, but then rapidly becomes out of date. Exponential growth had allowed minicomputers to edge by makers of mainframes who didn't make the ""exponential extrapolation"" and act on it fast enough. Exponential growth similarly allowed microcomputers - personal computers - to blow by minis, enriching Microsoft, which soon become the dominant maker of PC software. ""The growth curve of Microsoft is unprecidented in the annals of business, and seems quite miraculous until you realize that what we have done is ride the exponential growth curve of computer price/performance,"" Myhrvold wrote.The Myhrvold memo recites a Microsoft catechism that the hardware business must be avoided because its profit margins were too thin and the speed at which technology moved put hardware makers at perpetual risk of becoming obsolete. Better to concentrate on software and its higher margins, which Microsoft largely did until 18 months ago when the company produced its Surface computers, and then last fall when it purchased the Nokia handset business.But in his own way, Myhrvold, who left the company in 1999 for other business and personal enthusiasms, anticipated the day that Microsoft might have to become Microhard, too. ""The only hardware companies that have ever made significant money are those that managed to create an asset - the hardware architecture - which was above the fray of individual implementations and thus could enjoy a longer life span,"" he wrote, presaging the success of Apple's iPod, iPhone, and iPad businesses. ""The bulk of the worlds' computing cycles come near the low end, high volume part of the market,"" he continued, paving with words the road Apple would later take with its handheld computers. ""Any software company that wants to maintain its relative share of total CPU cycles must have products that are relevant to the high volume segment of the market. If you don't, then you are vulnerable to a software company that does establishes a position there and then rides the technology curve up to the mainstream. This is what the PC industry did to mainframes and minicomputers, and if we in the PC industry are not careful this fate will befall us as well.""If Myhrvold were writing this memo today, he'd acknowledge that smartphones are close to seizing the bulk of the world's computing cycles, and the smartphone is doing to the PC what it did to the mini and what the mini did to the mainframe. He'd add that Apple (and Google, with its Android operating system) and not Microsoft were riding the technology curve in the smartphone mainstream.It's not that Microsoft never competed in the itsy-bitsy computer space. It obeyed Myhrvold's dictim that ""Anything which isn't exponential in growth, or which is exponential but with a slower growth rate, will quickly and inexorably be overwhelmed."" It built operating systems for PDAs and cell phones, produced software for the SPOT smartwatch, manufactured Zune music players, and went large to produce the Xbox for gamers. (Anticipating the PDA, the smartphone, and an ""always connected""  device, Myhrvold pitched his company a tiny ""digital wallet"" in 1991.) But Microsoft mostly missed the waves or fell off them, and those failures help explain why Apple and Google have higher market caps than Microsoft. Today, we're probably just a couple of product cycles away from your smartphone (connected to a full-sized keyboard and monitor) being a solid substitute for your laptop and desktop computers. Unless Microsoft or its hardware allies produce a comparable product, the company could lose its already slipping primacy. Although Myhrvold never mentions the Internet by name, he correctly predicted that an ""information highway"" selling goods and services would wreck the Blockbuster video chain business as movie rentals go online, with similar transitions in banking, newspaper classifieds (""Newspapers are in probably the worst situation of any form of print media""), retail shopping, Siri-like speech recognition software, crime-fighting (he makes an early call for ubiquitous video surveillance), media time-shifting, outsourcing, the retail stock market, and the rise of realistic video games - ""you won't be able to tell the difference between the game and a movie."" Granted, he didn't predict cloud computing in his memo (although you could say that he implies it), sense the eventual rise of social media, or anticipate the ""piracy"" of music and movies. He also missed the mass migration of advertising to Google, which ordinarily collects about 90 percent of its revenues from ads.You could also knock Myhrvold for wrongly predicting the collapse of conventional broadcast and cable TV, although charitable readers will say his burial of the industry was just a tad premature. In one laugh-out-loud passage, he states with supreme confidence that the Microsoft At Work campaign would ""unify PCs with the telephone, FAX and copier."" Yeah, right. My phone, fax and copier still don't get along. Maybe the new Microsoft CEO will pay for group counseling?Still, Myhrvold's hits dwarf his misses. Other Myhrvold memos, analyzed by Ken Auletta in a May 12, 1997, New Yorker profile, reiterated the death-of-the-middleman themes etched in ""Road Kill."" He correctly predicted the demise of Egghead Software and Tower Records in the face of online competition, but in an uncharacteristic miscue, he pooh-poohed the Internet ""hype.""Myhrvold cheerfully conceded his fallibility to Auletta: ""When you predict the technological future, as I do, you basically are like an insurance salesman, futures trader or gambler.""As a historic document, ""Road Kill on the Information Highway"" deserves your attention. But its underlying message about exponential effects of modern technology remains so timeless that new CEO Nadella should keep a copy on his smartphone for inspiration, highlighting this memento mori codicil: ""Our own industry is also doomed, and will be one of the more significant carcasses by the side of the information highway.""",2014-02-07,MSFT,"Fri Feb 7, 2014 | 2:59pm EST",COLUMN-The 20-year-old Microsoft memo that came true,http://www.reuters.com//article/shafer-microsoft-idUSL2N0LC1L620140207?type=companyNews,0.9888,0.06,0.854,0.086

76,"  (Removes Colombani comments on Motorola sanctions)* Legal disputes centre on tablets and smartphone patents* Big firms waging ""patent wars"" amid battle for market shareBy Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS, Feb 10 EU regulators will rule on antitrust cases against Samsung Electronics and Motorola Mobility in April, the European Commission said on Monday as it seeks to end the so-called patent wars between smartphone makers. The Commission - the EU's antitrust authority - has been investigating the firms and others for using aggressive legal action to prevent rivals from selling smartphones and tablet computers in Europe by claiming they copied their designs.The patent wars between tech companies, also including Apple , Microsoft, Nokia and smaller rivals, underscore the fierce battle for market share in the lucrative mobile phone industry.The world's top smartphone makers, Samsung and Apple, are suing each other in more than 10 countries. Samsung, the target of a two-year EU investigation, has already indicated it is willing to compromise. Last October, the South Korean company said it would not take rivals to court over patent disputes over the next five years in a bid to avoid a multi-billion-euro fine from Brussels.The company subsequently sweetened its offer after EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia demanded more. ""The latest commitment proposals by Samsung are good and the Commission should be able to adopt a final decision in April,"" said Almunia's spokesman Antoine Colombani. The case of Google Inc's Motorola, under investigation in a separate case since 2012 following complaints from Apple and Microsoft over its efforts to ban the sale of their products, will also be decided in April, said Colombani.""This ongoing case is being handled under Article 7 of the Antitrust Regulation,"" he said.In such cases, the Commission typically orders companies to halt their anti-competitive practices and may hand out a fine up to 10 percent of a firm's global annual turnover. This could mean as much as $440 million for Motorola.Samsung and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

81,"   By Paul Carsten | BEIJING  BEIJING Microsoft Corp denied on Wednesday it was omitting websites from its Bing search engine results for users outside China after a Chinese rights group said the U.S. firm was censoring material the government deems politically sensitive.GreatFire.org, a China-based freedom of speech advocacy group, said in a statement on Tuesday that Bing was filtering out both English and Chinese language search results for terms such as ""Dalai Lama"", the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader whom Beijing brands as a violence-seeking separatist, charges he denies.Microsoft, responding to the rights group's allegations, said a system fault had removed some search results for users outside China. The company has in the past come under fire for censoring the Chinese version of internet phone and messaging software Skype.""Due to an error in our system, we triggered an incorrect results removal notification for some searches noted in the report but the results themselves are and were unaltered outside of China,"" Stefan Weitz, senior director for Bing, said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Wednesday.Weitz did not say if the error had been fixed and Microsoft officials in Beijing declined to elaborate. Microsoft sent a shortened version of the statement to China-based media organizations which omitted all reference to GreatFire.org and did not address the allegations.""There were too many points in the original statement,"" a China-based Microsoft spokeswoman told Reuters. Reuters reporters found that Bing omitted several websites that showed up on the search engine of rival Google Inc when they searched for ""Dalai Lama"" in Chinese from Singapore.

82,"   By Paul Carsten | BEIJING  BEIJING Feb 12 Microsoft Corp denied on Wednesday it was omitting websites from its Bing search engine results for users outside China after a Chinese rights group said the U.S. firm was censoring material the government deems politically sensitive.GreatFire.org, a China-based freedom of speech advocacy group, said in a statement on Tuesday that Bing was filtering out both English and Chinese language search results for terms such as ""Dalai Lama"", the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader whom Beijing brands as a violence-seeking separatist, charges he denies.Microsoft, responding to the rights group's allegations, said a system fault had removed some search results for users outside China. The company has in the past come under fire for censoring the Chinese version of internet phone and messaging software Skype.""Due to an error in our system, we triggered an incorrect results removal notification for some searches noted in the report but the results themselves are and were unaltered outside of China,"" Stefan Weitz, senior director for Bing, said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Wednesday. Weitz did not say if the error had been fixed and Microsoft officials in Beijing declined to elaborate.Microsoft sent a shortened version of the statement to China-based media organisations which omitted all reference to GreatFire.org and did not address the allegations.""There were too many points in the original statement,"" a China-based Microsoft spokeswoman told Reuters.

90,"   By Paul Sandle | BARCELONA  BARCELONA Feb 23 Microsoft Corp is pushing to reach a far wider audience for smartphones running its Windows Phone software by turning to cheaper chipsets and easing restrictions on how phone makers use its software to encourage them to drive down costs.Nick Parker, Microsoft's senior vice president for handset makers, said the changes have attracted a range of new handset makers to build Windows Phones, including South Korea's LG Electronics, India's Xola and Karbonn, and ZTE , Foxconn, Lenovo, Gionee and Longcheer.""We are open for business on Windows Phone to anyone who wants to build a Windows phone,"" Parker said at the Mobile World Congress trade fair on Sunday.Windows Phones typically sell for several hundred dollars a piece, although Nokia's Lumia 520 handset has an unsubsidised price of about 139 euros ($190) in Europe.The sub-$100 smartphone market, however, is dominated by Google's Android operating system, which has lower licensing costs, is more adaptable by device makers, and runs on more, and cheaper, chip sets that run radio and other functions.Android phones from dozens of handset makers accounted for almost four out of every five smartphones sold, or 781.2 million units, last year, according to Strategy Analytics. Microsoft was a distant third in market share terms, behind Apple, which shipped 153.4 million smartphones.Some 5.7 million Windows Mobile units were shipped worldwide, Strategy Analytics said. While it gained a more than 10 percent share in some markets, for example Italy, other markets like the United States remained tough, Vice President Joe Belgiore said in Barcelona.The next major update of the software in coming months would allow it to support less expensive chip sets from its existing supplier, Qualcomm Inc. Some of the Windows Phone standards would also be eased, he said. Microsoft had previously kept a tight grip on hardware specifications, for example insisting on three physical buttons, to create a uniform Windows Phone user experience, regardless of handset maker.That is no longer a requirement, allowing phone makers to use cheaper soft keys and adapt designs used for Android phones.Belgiore said Microsoft was investing in improvements that would help handset makers get Windows Phone on devices at ""lower costs in terms of manufacturing, licensing and those sorts of things"". For example, in a bid to reach immigrant workers looking to cheaply call home, Microsoft is including support for dual SIM cards, allowing users to switch phone tariffs to make cheaper local or international calls.The lion's share of Windows Phones, more than 90 percent last year according to AdDuplex, are made by Nokia. Microsoft is just about to close a deal to buy Nokia's handset business for $7.2 billion. HTC, Huawei and Samsung  also make Windows Mobile devices.""We will continue to have those iconic devices from our deep partners, but also we'll see an emergence of a lot more of what we call white label phones, maybe operators' phone themselves, retailers' phones,"" Parker said.Microsoft also said on Sunday it would update its Windows 8.1 operating system, which runs on PCs and tablets, in the coming months after research found traditional keyboard users were less satisfied with the software than previous versions of Windows.""We love touch, but we think we could improve the situation for all those keyboard users,"" Belgiore said.",2014-02-23,MSFT,"Sun Feb 23, 2014 | 5:48pm EST",Microsoft resets Windows Phone to reach lower cost markets,http://www.reuters.com//article/mobile-world-microsoft-idUSL6N0LS10220140223?type=companyNews,0.9821,0.011,0.909,0.08
91,"  PARIS Orange said on Tuesday it was in talks with Microsoft over a possible tie-up with its video-sharing website Dailymotion, nearly a year after discussions with Yahoo collapsed following state opposition.Orange said it would keep a majority stake in Dailymotion, the world's 12th largest video-sharing site, but is looking for partners outside of Europe to develop it internationally, Chief Executive Stephane Richard told BFM Business radio.""We have ongoing talks, particularly with Microsoft, which doesn't necessarily mean that we'll come to a deal,"" said Richard, speaking from the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona.""I think it makes a lot of sense for us, as for Microsoft, to reach an accord that would be above all a partnership,"" he said, adding that Orange was also talking with other content providers, including in France. The French state owns 28.4 percent of Orange, so it has some sway over the group's actions and management.Last year, French Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg blocked a plan by U.S.-web giant Yahoo to buy a majority stake in Dailymotion. Montebourg spurred a public row over state intervention in business affairs after he said that the U.S. group wanted to ""devour"" its smaller rival, calling it a ""golden nugget"" that needed to be kept in French hands.Yahoo, which had planned to acquire a 75 percent stake in a deal that valued Dailymotion at $300 million, eventually walked away from the talks, leaving Orange to seek a new strategic partner to develop its video site.

92,"   By Jim Finkle | BOSTON  BOSTON Feb 25 A cybersecurity firm said on Tuesday that it uncovered stolen credentials from some 360 million accounts that are available for sale on cyber black markets, though it is unsure where they came from or what they can be used to access.The discovery could represent more of a risk to consumers and companies than stolen credit card data because of the chance the sets of user names and passwords could open the door to online bank accounts, corporate networks, health records and virtually any other type of computer system.Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security LLC, said in an interview that his firm obtained the data over the past three weeks, meaning an unprecedented amount of stolen credentials is available for sale underground.""The sheer volume is overwhelming,"" said Holden, whose firm last year helped uncover a major data breach at Adobe Systems Inc in which tens of millions of records were stolen.Holden said he believes the 360 million records were obtained in separate attacks, including one that yielded some 105 million records, which would make it the largest single credential breaches known to date. He said he believes the credentials were stolen in breaches that have yet to be publicly reported. The companies attacked may remain unaware until they are notified by third parties who find evidence of the hacking, he said.""We have staff working around the clock to identify the victims,"" he said.He has not provided any information about the attacks to other cybersecurity firms or authorities but intends to alert the companies involved if his staff can identify them. The massive trove of credentials includes user names, which are typically email addresses, and passwords that in most cases are in unencrypted text. Holden said that in contrast, the Adobe breach, which he uncovered in October 2013, yielded tens of millions of records that had encrypted passwords, which made it more difficult for hackers to use them.The email addresses are from major providers such as AOL Inc , Google Inc, Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc and almost all Fortune 500 companies and nonprofit organizations. Holden said he alerted one major email provider that is a client, but he declined to identify the company, citing a nondisclosure agreement.Heather Bearfield, who runs the cybersecurity practice for accounting firm Marcum LLP, said she had no information about the information that Hold Security uncovered but that it was plausible for hackers to obtain such a large amount of data because these breaches are on the rise. She said hackers can do far more harm with stolen credentials than with stolen payment cards, particularly when people use the same login and password for multiple accounts.""They can get access to your actual bank account. That is huge,"" Bearfield said. ""That is not necessarily recoverable funds.""After recent payment-card data breaches, including one at U.S. retailer Target, credit card companies stressed that consumers bear little risk because they are refunded rapidly for fraud losses.Wade Baker, a data breach investigator with Verizon Communications Inc, said that the number of attacks targeting payment cards through point-of-sales systems peaked in 2011. That was partly because banks and retailers have gotten better at identifying that type of breach and quickly moving to prevent crooks from making fraudulent transactions, he said.In addition to the 360 million credentials, the criminals are selling some 1.25 billion email addresses, which would be of interest to spammers, Hold Security said in a statement on its website ().",2014-02-25,MSFT,"Tue Feb 25, 2014 | 6:33pm EST",360 mln newly stolen credentials on black market -cybersecurity firm,http://www.reuters.com//article/cybercrime-databreach-idUSL1N0LU22520140225?type=companyNews,-0.9897,0.106,0.844,0.05

94,"  SEATTLE Julie Larson-Green, one of Microsoft Corp's most senior women executives and a leading force behind the latest design of Windows, is moving to a new job in charge of harmonizing the look and usability of Microsoft's wide range of software.Larson-Green, who oversaw the design of Windows 7 and its less popular successor Windows 8, was promoted to run Microsoft's Devices and Studios group as part of former chief executive Steve Ballmer's sweeping reorganization of the company last July.However, when Microsoft agreed to buy Nokia's handset unit only a few months later, Microsoft planned to put former Nokia boss Stephen Elop in charge of that group, with Larson-Green reporting to him.Elop is still set to take over that group when the Nokia deal is completed, expected in the next few weeks, but with the move Larson-Green is no longer set to report to him. ""I'll remain in (the) role leading the DnS (Devices and Studios) organization in the interim until the Nokia deal closes and Stephen Elop makes his transition to Microsoft,"" said Larson-Green in an email to colleagues which was obtained by Reuters. The memo and job change were earlier reported by Seattle-area tech news site GeekWire.The new job means Larson-Green, known for introducing the 'ribbon' bar to the Office suite of applications, returns to software-focused design after leading the Devices and Studios group which is centered on hardware such as the Xbox game console and Surface tablet.

95,"  SEATTLE Feb 24 Julie Larson-Green, one of Microsoft Corp's most senior women executives and a leading force behind the latest design of Windows, is moving to a new job in charge of harmonizing the look and usability of Microsoft's wide range of software.Larson-Green, who oversaw the design of Windows 7 and its less popular successor Windows 8, was promoted to run Microsoft's Devices and Studios group as part of former chief executive Steve Ballmer's sweeping reorganization of the company last July.However, when Microsoft agreed to buy Nokia's  handset unit only a few months later, Microsoft planned to put former Nokia boss Stephen Elop in charge of that group, with Larson-Green reporting to him.Elop is still set to take over that group when the Nokia deal is completed, expected in the next few weeks, but with the move Larson-Green is no longer set to report to him. ""I'll remain in (the) role leading the DnS (Devices and Studios) organization in the interim until the Nokia deal closes and Stephen Elop makes his transition to Microsoft,"" said Larson-Green in an email to colleagues which was obtained by Reuters. The memo and job change were earlier reported by Seattle-area tech news site GeekWire.The new job means Larson-Green, known for introducing the 'ribbon' bar to the Office suite of applications, returns to software-focused design after leading the Devices and Studios group which is centered on hardware such as the Xbox game console and Surface tablet.

107,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) LONDON, March 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has maintained Nokia Corporation's  (Nokia) 'BB-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior unsecured ratings on Rating  Watch Positive (RWP), pending the closing of the disposal of Nokia's Devices &  Services (D&S) activities to Microsoft Corporation (AA+/Stable). Fitch placed Nokia on RWP at the time of the disposal announcement in September  2013. Nokia continues to guide to a transaction close in 1Q14 and that it  intends to announce the results of its strategic evaluation shortly afterwards.  Resolution of the RWP will include a formal review of the underlying continuing  operations as well as an understanding of management's intentions with respect  to the disposal proceeds and objectives for the long-term capitalisation of the  business. KEY RATING DRIVERS Removing Handsets Weakness The sale of the D&S business will bring to a close a period of extreme stress in  the credit profile of the handset industry's former leading manufacturer, which  at one time accounted for close to 40% handset unit volumes on a consistent  basis. The pace of industry change, the accelerated advent of the smartphone and  dominance of Apple's iOS and Google's Android as the industry's leading  operating systems have seen Nokia's handsets business increasingly marginalised.  The business has recorded significant losses and driven material weakness in the  company's cash flows. Non-IFRS losses from discounted operations were EUR667m in  2013 (EUR1.1bn in 2012) while net cash flow was negative EUR1.2bn (2012:  negative EUR2.4bn).  NSN, Advanced Technologies Underpin Profile Following the disposal, Nokia Solutions & Networks (NSN) and the newly created  Advanced Technologies (the division housing Nokia's technology licensing  activities) will form the most significant underlying business drivers of the  group. NSN, which accounted for 89% of 2013 ongoing revenues, has reported  increasingly solid results, although top-line performance continues to reflect  decisions to exit low margin or unprofitable markets and customer relationships.  Non-IFRS operating income of EUR1.1bn and a margin of 9.7% at NSN in 2013  underlines the increasing resilience of this business. Advanced Technologies is  expected to increase its annualised  net revenue run-rate to EUR600m following  the D&S disposal, while the division reported a non-IFRS operating profit of  EUR329m and margin of 62.2% in FY13. Nokia's location/mapping division (HERE)  provides a smaller (FY13 sales of EUR914m/non-IFRS margin 5.2%) but nonetheless  important revenue stream.  Improved Earnings Visibility Revenue pressures at NSN (both market driven and a function of ongoing strategic  contract exits) continue to be expected in 2014. Fitch assumes high single/low  double digit declines in our rating case. Revenue and margin visibility at NSN  and Advanced Technologies is nonetheless expected to be far better than under a  reporting perimeter that previously included the volatility and weakness in the  D&S division. The sustainability of revenues and margins at NSN will be an  important driver in determining any potential ratings upside for Nokia, while a  separately reported division housing the company's licensing activity increases  visibility of this high margin revenue stream.     Ratings Upside Fitch continues to guide that closing of the transaction is likely to result at  a minimum in the affirmation of the current rating and assignment of a Stable  Outlook, but that potential exists for a one-notch upgrade.  The D&S disposal will remove the weakest and most challenging part of the  business, a business that was burning cash at a run-rate of around EUR300m per  quarter in 2013. Continuing operations generate healthy underlying cash flow and  Nokia is expected to continue to manage the balance sheet conservatively, ie on  a net cash basis. Fitch's confidence in the sustainability of cash flows in the  underlying business, although this was materially down on the previous year, is  the key driver to ratings upside from the current level. We similarly view a  commitment to conservative financial policies and a net cash position as  important for the rating.   RATING SENSITIVITIES  Positive: Future developments that could lead to positive rating action include: Closure of the D&S disposal along with signs the margin and cash flow profile  currently presented by Nokia on a pro-forma basis are sustainable.  Any positive rating action would be predicated on clarity over management's  expectations for the company's long-term capital structure. Fitch would expect  this to continue to include a net cash position.  Negative: Future developments that could lead to negative rating action include: Failure of the proposed disposal to complete on a timely basis would be likely  to lead at a minimum to the assignment of a Negative Outlook on the current  ratings, subject to ongoing performance at both NSN and the D&S division.

120,"   By Gerry Shih and Bill Rigby | SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE  SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE It may be one of Microsoft Corp's biggest squandered opportunities.Tired of waiting for Office to be optimized for their mobile gadgets, a growing contingent of younger companies is turning to cheaper, simpler and touch-friendly apps that can perform word processing and other tasks in the cloud.Take Artivest Holdings Inc, a New York-based financial services startup that sells alternative investment products. The New York-based company uses an app called Quip, which combines word processing and messaging, to handle all but the most sensitive legal and financial files.""There are no more Microsoft Word documents being circulated. If someone emails me a Word document, I'll tell them to put it in Quip,"" said Artivest Chief Investment Officer David Levine.""If I'm walking to and from home, or going to an appointment, I can review or edit on my iPad. Not being tied to my desk, that's a big pro,"" he said.The speed with which apps like Quip have been adopted is forcing Microsoft to intensify its efforts to bring the powerful but ageing Office software suite to tablets and smartphones, according to people close to the company.Microsoft already has a full iPhone and iPad version of Office ready for release, the sources said. The only question is when Chief Executive Satya Nadella, who took over in February, will pull the trigger.Nadella wants to widen Office's customer base but has to balance that with the flagship Windows franchise, which benefits greatly from tight integration with Office, especially on desktop computers.""We have some pretty exciting plans,"" said John Case, the top Office marketing executive, without giving any details. ""Certainly, interest in Office on the iPad is extreme. When they (customers) want to do real work, they are going to want to use Office.""Investors for years have urged Microsoft to adapt Office, its most profitable product, for mobile devices from Apple Inc and Google Inc - rather than shackling it to Windows as PC sales decline.Activist investment firm ValueAct Capital, whose president Mason Morfit sits on Microsoft's board, has more recently voiced misgivings about Office's continued mobile absence, sources familiar with the firm said.According to one analyst estimate, Microsoft is giving up $2.5 billion a year in revenue by keeping Office off the iPad, which has now sold almost 200 million units. ""Office is being disenfranchised on the hottest growth platforms,"" Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund wrote in a note to clients. ""Maybe it is time to focus on Office independent of Windows.""Some analysts say it may be too late for Microsoft to win back the iPad generation, even if it introduces a mobile-optimized Office suite in the next few months, as expected.""Look at the applications that are on the rise to support mobile. It is not Microsoft OneNote or Word. It's Dropbox, or Evernote,"" said Ted Schadler, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. ""It's really about being everywhere. That's an important, immediate decision that Satya's going to have to drive.""NEW APPS ON THE BLOCK Microsoft's productivity tools remain the industry standard, with more than a billion users spending almost $25 billion on them last fiscal year. But Office revenues are driven primarily by corporate officers who buy for large workforces - and more than half of America's employees use a mobile device daily to supplement their work.The rapid rise of apps such as Quip, Haiku Deck, Prezi, Paper, Smartsheet, Good and Evernote, not to mention Google Apps, is nibbling away at the Office franchise. That is particularly true among mid-sized and smaller companies, which tend to be more frugal and less dependent on legacy Office documents or spreadsheets. Ian Ray, a network administrator at Cypress Grove Chevre Inc, a cheese maker based in Arcata, California, has most of his 35-member workforce using web-friendly apps on iPads and Google Chromebooks.""We use Google for email, Google Docs tied to that, Expensify for expense reports, Lucidchart for doing flow charts, and Smartsheet for organizing projects,"" Ray said.After more than two decades, Microsoft has in recent years eased some Office functions into the mobile arena, mostly accessibly via web browser. The company has yet to release a touchscreen-optimized version of the full Office suite including Word, PowerPoint and Excel - not even for the Windows 8 operating system.One reason for the delay appears to be internal politics. The powerful Windows group and the younger but more profitable Office group have a patchy history of collaboration.When then-Windows boss Steven Sinofsky unveiled the touch-friendly Windows 8 and the Surface tablet in late 2012, many industry insiders remarked on the absence of a tailor-made Office suite, which was shepherded by Kurt DelBene at the time.Both Sinofsky and DelBene left their jobs within months. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has vowed to override divisions with his 'One Microsoft' overhaul launched last summer, now in Nadella's hands. But divisions remain. Some in the Windows camp want to make sure Office remains primarily a Windows experience, which should help sales of the Surface. Others in the Office camp, however, want to reach customers on as many platforms as possible.""We will bring these apps to Windows devices and also other devices like the iPad in ways that meet our customers' needs and in ways that make sense economically for Microsoft,"" the company said in a recent statement.CLOCK TICKING According to research firm Ovum, 57 percent of all employees use a personal smartphone or tablet to access corporate data, while 70 percent of tablet owners use their personal tablets at work at some point.Companies are increasingly allowing employees to work on their personal devices - a trend the IT industry has dubbed ""bring your own device"" or BYOD.That is the true danger for Microsoft, said Adam Tratt, a former Office executive who is now chief executive of Seattle-based Haiku Deck, an iPad-based presentation app.""Microsoft rose to dominance in an age when the CIO (chief information officer) really held the keys to IT decision making,"" said Tratt. ""Over the past five years, BYOD has really eroded the level of control that many CIOs have.""Although they are not as fully fleshed out as Office, younger challengers have been built from the ground up in an era defined by mobile devices and cloud computing.Text files in Quip, for instance, are not formatted in virtual 8.5- by 11-inch pieces of paper - instead, they automatically zoom to fit any tablet screen. Revisions in a file can be made and viewed, in real time, by collaborators without sending email attachments back and forth.""We don't have Word's 30 years of features built into it,"" said Bret Taylor, Quip's co-founder. ""But we're much better at collaboration and much better at mobile.""(Reporting by Gerry Shih and Bill Rigby; Editing by Edwin Chan and Tiffany Wu)",2014-03-13,MSFT,"Thu Mar 13, 2014 | 3:40pm EDT",Microsoft poised to fight back as iPad generation shuns Office,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-microsoft-office-analysis-idUSBREA2C20320140313?type=companyNews,0.998,0.019,0.884,0.097

123,"  LONDON Four of the biggest U.S. technology groups collectively hold an estimated $124 billion in U.S. Treasury debt, much of it offshore, earning them tax-free interest, the UK's Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) said on Thursday.The finding means Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Google Inc and Cisco Systems Inc hold a large proportion of the $254.9 billion held in their foreign subsidiaries in U.S. Treasuries, according to securities filings reviewed by the London-based BIJ, a not-for-profit news organization.Bringing the money home would trigger a tax bill, so the companies keep it offshore, partly to fund foreign expansion but also, executives say, to avoid a tax hit.Democratic party Senator Carl Levin, who has campaigned for years against tax avoidance, was quoted saying by the BIJ that if U.S. corporations invested offshore funds in U.S. government debt, this income should face U.S. taxes. ""Those funds ought to be treated as having been repatriated and subject to U.S. tax,"" Levin said. Corporations including Apple have lobbied for changes so they would not have to pay U.S. tax on income earned outside the United States and brought home. Many other countries, including Britain, only tax income earned within their borders, though some international companies have been accused of reducing their bill via sophisticated offshore accounting arrangements.Some U.S. companies say a ""territorial"" type of tax system would avoid double taxation and ensure all businesses compete on equal terms. Tax campaigners say it would encourage companies to shift profits overseas.

124,"  LONDON, March 13 Four of the biggest U.S. technology groups collectively hold an estimated $124 billion in U.S. Treasury debt, much of it offshore, earning them tax-free interest, the UK's Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) said on Thursday.The finding means Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp , Google Inc and Cisco Systems Inc  hold a large proportion of the $254.9 billion held in their foreign subsidiaries in U.S. Treasuries, according to securities filings reviewed by the London-based BIJ, a not-for-profit news organisation.Bringing the money home would trigger a tax bill, so the companies keep it offshore, partly to fund foreign expansion but also, executives say, to avoid a tax hit. Democratic party Senator Carl Levin, who has campaigned for years against tax avoidance, was quoted saying by the BIJ that if U.S. corporations invested offshore funds in U.S. government debt, this income should face U.S. taxes.""Those funds ought to be treated as having been repatriated and subject to U.S. tax,"" Levin said. Corporations including Apple have lobbied for changes so they would not have to pay U.S. tax on income earned outside the United States and brought home. Many other countries, including Britain, only tax income earned within their borders, though some international companies have been accused of reducing their bill via sophisticated offshore accounting arrangements. Some U.S. companies say a ""territorial"" type of tax system would avoid double taxation and ensure all businesses compete on equal terms. Tax campaigners say it would encourage companies to shift profits overseas.Google said it responded to tax incentives offered by governments while following tax rules in every country where it operates.

125,"  NEW DELHI India's Supreme Court on Friday ordered Nokia to give a 35 billion rupee ($572.5 million) guarantee before it transfers one of its biggest handset plants to Microsoft Corp.The ruling upheld a lower court verdict over the plant in Chennai, which is the subject of a tax dispute, and had been challenged by the Finnish company.Nokia's case is one of several high-profile tax disputes involving foreign companies in India. Vodafone Group, IBM and Royal Dutch Shell are among foreign groups contesting local tax claims.Nokia, which is selling its mobile phones business to Microsoft in a 5.4 billion euro ($7.5 billion) deal, previously agreed to set aside 22.5 billion rupees in an escrow account while it fights the Indian tax authority's claims in court.

However, NSN recently reported its fourth-quarter sales fell 22 percent from a year earlier, raising concerns about its growth prospects.NSN, which was originally a joint venture of Nokia and Siemens, accounts for about 90 percent of Nokia's sales after the handset deal.

136,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The last time email could be called a sexy business, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was celebrating his tenth birthday. Yet Proofpoint Inc, a $1.6 billion market cap email security company, is catching the eye of fund managers by gaining share in a market that many investors have left for dead.Twenty-six small-cap funds added Proofpoint to their portfolios over the last quarter, a nearly 15 percent increase from the quarter before, Morningstar data show. A total of 249 funds own the stock, a level analysts say is unusually high for a company with a market value of its size that has yet to show a profit.The interest comes amid a renewed corporate focus on protection against hackers and state-sponsored cyber attacks following well-publicized data breaches at several retailers and financial firms. Six of the 10 largest breaches in history have occurred over the last year.About 95 percent of targeted attacks begin with so-called phishing attempts - bogus emails designed to trick users into entering their log-in information or other sensitive data, according to a 2013 report by Verizon Communications Inc on data breaches.At the same time, the dominant providers of security software have made missteps that allowed Proofpoint to gain market share, analysts say.Intel Corp's security division (which until recently was known as McAfee) ""gave themselves a very black eye"" by waiting three years between software upgrades, said Rick Holland, an analyst at Forrester Research.Google Inc shut down its Postini business and expected to migrate those customers into its Google Apps product, but the company was ""a little overzealous in its estimates of how quickly people were going to adopt"" the change, Holland said.Rivals dedicated to email security got bought by bigger firms, leaving Proofpoint the only pure-play email security provider, said Peter Firstbrook, a vice president with research firm Gartner who advises companies on email technology.""It's like the Red Sea parted from a competitive standpoint,"" said John Bichelmeyer, lead portfolio manager of the $563 million Buffalo Emerging Opportunities fund.Proofpoint, based in Sunnyvale, California, is one of only two rapidly growing email security firms, along with Microsoft Corp, in a market worth about $1.7 billion in 2012, according to Gartner. Proofpoint had 6 percent market share in 2012, versus 22 percent for Cisco Systems Inc, 20 for Symantec Corp and 8 percent for Microsoft. Gartner has yet to release data for 2013. Proofpoint's gains could make it an acquisition target by a larger company hoping to expand its reach, even though its stock price has jumped 25.5 percent so far this year, analysts said.""I thought they would have been acquired a long time ago,"" said Holland.HIGH TARGETS BUT NO PROFITS Analysts tracked by Reuters are largely bullish on the company, though they expect it to continue posting losses a couple more years. Thirteen out of the 14 analysts who cover the company rate it as a 'strong buy' or 'buy,' while Robert Breza at Stern, Agee & Leach rates it a 'hold.' At Thursday's closing price of $41.63, Proofpoint's stock was 12.4 percent below analysts' median target of $46.81.The company, which went public in 2012 at $13 a share, posted revenues of $176 million in its latest fiscal year.

Holland, who also advises companies on email security technology, said Proofpoint has developed strong loyalty among returning customers.""I have found that some customers may adopt Microsoft or Google and drop something like Proofpoint, but six months later they go back and have Proofpoint sitting in front because it is more robust,"" he said.Yet email administrators do not always get to make the final decision on which products their companies purchase.Cisco maintains it has an advantage over Proofpoint because it offers a broad line of security products that protect businesses across their network, from firewall to desktop computers.""Malware gets through every day.

137,"  * Microsoft withdraws support for Windows XP on April 8* U.S., UK major banks negotiate fees for extended support* 95 percent of world's 2.2 million ATMs run on outdated XP* One-third of ATMs have been upgraded to Windows 7* Cost of upgrade for each UK bank around $100 million - sourcesBy Matt Scuffham and David HenryLONDON/NEW YORK, March 14 Banks around the world, consumed with meeting more stringent capital regulations, will miss a deadline to upgrade outdated software for automated teller machines (ATMs) and face additional costs to Microsoft  to keep them secure.The U.S. software company first warned that it was planning to end support for Windows XP in 2007, but only one-third of the world's 2.2 million ATMs which use the system will have been upgraded to a new platform, such as Windows 7 by the April deadline, according to NCR, one of the biggest ATM makers.To ensure the machines are protected against viruses and hackers many banks have agreed deals with Microsoft to continue supporting their ATMs until they are upgraded, extra costs and negotiations that were avoidable but are now likely to be a distraction for bank executives.""There are certainly large enterprise customers who haven't finished their migrations yet and are purchasing custom support,"" a spokesman for Microsoft said, declining to name those customers or to quantify the extra revenue it is earning.""The cost will depend on both the specific needs of the customer and what support they already have in place, so it's different for every customer."" Britain's five biggest banks - Lloyds Banking Group , Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays and Santander UK - either have, or are in the process of negotiating, extended support contracts with Microsoft.The cost of extending support and upgrading to a new platform for each of Britain's main banks would be in the region of 50 to 60 million pounds ($100 million), according to London-based Sridhar Athreya, principle at financial technology advisers SunGard Consulting Services - an estimate corroborated by a source at one of the banks.Athreya said banks have left it late to upgrade systems after being overwhelmed by new regulatory demands in the wake of the 2007-08 financial crisis.""They were probably not very serious about the directive that came in from Microsoft. There's a lot of change going on at these banks at this moment in time and they would have seen Windows XP as one more change,"" he said.Windows XP currently supports around 95 percent of the world's ATMs.About 440,000 - or one-fifth of the world's ATMs - are located in the United States and many of the banks operating them will still be running their ATMs with Windows XP for a while after the April 8 deadline, said Doug Johnson, vice president for risk management policy at the American Bankers Association. ""One thing in our favour is that XP is battle-hardened,"" Johnson said. ""People will benefit from years of fine-tuning of XP...It has been through wars.""STAND IN LINE The queue of banks waiting to upgrade means there aren't enough people to do the work.""There is a little bit of a bottle-neck,"" said Johnson.Some banks are using the upgrade as an opportunity to introduce new features to their ATMs such as being able to read cards that have microchips rather than magnetic stripes.Banks in the United States, where the old-fashioned swipe and sign magnetic stripe credit cards are still in use, have to upgrade their ATMs to read chip cards. JPMorgan, which has 19,200 ATMs, will start converting its machines to Windows 7 in July, with a goal of finishing by the end of the year. With the change, JPMorgan expects to improve data encryption and ensure machines take software upgrades more efficiently and be offline for less time.A spokeswoman for the bank declined to say how much JPMorgan is paying Microsoft for the extended XP coverage.Bank of America also said it would ask Microsoft to extend support for its machines still running on Windows XP.Citigroup Inc, which has more than 12,000 ATMs worldwide, said it is in the process of upgrading its machines from XP and declined to give further details.In Britain, RBS, which has been hit by a succession of IT problems, has agreed a fee with Microsoft in return for it continuing to support its 9,000 ATMs for up to three years, a source familiar with the arrangement told Reuters.RBS will begin upgrading its ATMs to run on Windows 7 next year and expects to complete the process within three years, the source said. The investment is part of the 1.4 billion pounds each year which new Chief Executive Ross McEwan has committed in order to improve the bank's computer systems.McEwan admitted in December that RBS had neglected its technology for decades.Lloyds said it had agreed to pay Microsoft an undisclosed amount to extend support until 2016 while it upgrades its 7,000 ATMs. The bank will start upgrading its ATMs later this year.HSBC, which has 3,200 ATMs, said it was two years into a three-year programme of upgrades which it expects to complete next year. It had also reached a deal with Microsoft.Barclays, which has 4,300 ATMs, said it was still negotiating with Microsoft while Santander UK, which has 2,370 ATMs, said it had already agreed a deal.",2014-03-17,MSFT,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 7:32am EDT",REFILE-Banks to be hit with Microsoft costs for running outdated ATMs,http://www.reuters.com//article/banks-atms-idUSL6N0M345C20140317?type=companyNews,0.9989,0.021,0.835,0.144

143,"   By Soham Chatterjee  Microsoft Corp's shares scaled levels last seen in the dotcom boom following reports that the company plans to unveil an iPad version of its Office software suite, potentially generating billions of dollars in revenue.Reuters reported late on Monday that new Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella would unveil the iPad app at an event on March 27.The event will be Nadella's first major public appearance since his appointment last month.Microsoft shares rose as much as 5 percent to $39.90 on Tuesday, adding $15 billion to the company's market value. At that price, the stock was up about 10 percent since the announcement of Nadella's appointment on February 4. The shares last touched $40 in July 2000.Microsoft has had iPad and iPhone versions of Office primed for several months now, sources told Reuters, but the company has dallied on their release due to internal divisions, among other things.Analysts said the lack of an Office version for the iPad may have robbed Microsoft of billions of dollars in revenue. (Reuters Insider: reut.rs/1gC77rr) ""We estimate that if 10 percent of the iPad install base were to subscribe to Office then this could add 15 million subscribers and generate $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion in consumer Office subscription revenue per year,"" Bernstein Research analyst Mark Moerdler said in a note on Tuesday.Investors have for years urged Microsoft to adapt Office, its most profitable product, for iPhones and iPads and devices using Google Inc's Android software rather than shackling it to Windows as PC sales decline.Microsoft's productivity tools remain the industry standard in offices, but America's employees are increasingly using smartphone and tablets to supplement their work.Tired of waiting for Office to be optimized for their touchscreen devices, a growing contingent of younger companies are turning to cheaper touch-friendly apps that can perform word processing and other tasks in the cloud. Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said the plan to launch the iPad app would signal that Microsoft is moving towards a more serious cross-platform strategy.Bernstein's Moerdler said he did not believe that the app would have any significant positive or negative impact on Microsoft's Windows franchise as most corporate customers use Windows.Microsoft already offers Office Online on its Windows smartphones and as a free Web-based version.

148,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The last time email could be called a sexy business, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg was celebrating his tenth birthday. Yet Proofpoint Inc, a $1.6 billion market cap email security company, is catching the eye of fund managers by gaining share in a market that many investors have left for dead.Twenty-six small-cap funds added Proofpoint to their portfolios over the last quarter, a nearly 15 percent increase from the quarter before, Morningstar data show. A total of 249 funds own the stock, a level analysts say is unusually high for a company with a market value of its size that has yet to show a profit.The interest comes amid a renewed corporate focus on protection against hackers and state-sponsored cyber attacks following well-publicized data breaches at several retailers and financial firms. Six of the 10 largest breaches in history have occurred over the last year.About 95 percent of targeted attacks begin with so-called phishing attempts - bogus emails designed to trick users into entering their log-in information or other sensitive data, according to a 2013 report by Verizon Communications Inc on data breaches.At the same time, the dominant providers of security software have made missteps that allowed Proofpoint to gain market share, analysts say.Intel Corp's security division (which until recently was known as McAfee) ""gave themselves a very black eye"" by waiting three years between software upgrades, said Rick Holland, an analyst at Forrester Research. The division, however, disputed that assessment on Monday, saying its email security software -- updated almost on a quarterly basis -- is in fact gaining market share.Google Inc shut down its Postini business and expected to migrate those customers into its Google Apps product, but the company was ""a little overzealous in its estimates of how quickly people were going to adopt"" the change, Holland said.Rivals dedicated to email security got bought by bigger firms, leaving Proofpoint the only pure-play email security provider, said Peter Firstbrook, a vice president with research firm Gartner who advises companies on email technology.""It's like the Red Sea parted from a competitive standpoint,"" said John Bichelmeyer, lead portfolio manager of the $563 million Buffalo Emerging Opportunities fund.Proofpoint, based in Sunnyvale, California, is one of only two rapidly growing email security firms, along with Microsoft Corp, in a market worth about $1.7 billion in 2012, according to Gartner. Proofpoint had 6 percent market share in 2012, versus 22 percent for Cisco Systems Inc, 20 percent for Symantec Corp and 8 percent for Microsoft. Gartner has yet to release data for 2013. Proofpoint's gains could make it an acquisition target by a larger company hoping to expand its reach, even though its stock price has jumped 25.5 percent so far this year, analysts said.""I thought they would have been acquired a long time ago,"" said Holland.HIGH TARGETS BUT NO PROFITS Analysts tracked by Reuters are largely bullish on the company, though they expect it to continue posting losses a couple more years. Thirteen out of the 14 analysts who cover the company rate it as a 'strong buy' or 'buy,' while Robert Breza at Stern, Agee & Leach rates it a 'hold.' At Thursday's closing price of $41.63, Proofpoint's stock was 12.4 percent below analysts' median target of $46.81.The company, which went public in 2012 at $13 a share, posted revenues of $176 million in its latest fiscal year. Analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters estimate a loss of 18 cents per share, on revenues on $40.7 million, when it releases its quarterly results on April 21. It trades at a forward price to book value of 32.2. Tim Klassel, an analyst at Northland Capital Markets, expects a loss per share of 50 cents this fiscal year and 28 cents next year.PURE PLAY Fund managers like Bichelmeyer, who has been adding to his position, say the company is seen as the only pure-play investment in the cloud-based security market, a relatively new industry that FBR Capital Markets expects to grow into a $7 billion market.Proofpoint is rated as one of the top two providers of corporate email security products by Gartner, whose recommendations are closely watched by technology buyers.""Proofpoint lives or dies by email, so they are more focused on their customers,"" Firstbrook said. ""If you are an email administrator you want to work with somebody who is really focused on this problem over somebody focused on generic security and networking problems."" Holland, who also advises companies on email security technology, said Proofpoint has developed strong loyalty among returning customers.""I have found that some customers may adopt Microsoft or Google and drop something like Proofpoint, but six months later they go back and have Proofpoint sitting in front because it is more robust,"" he said.Yet email administrators do not always get to make the final decision on which products their companies purchase.Cisco maintains it has an advantage over Proofpoint because it offers a broad line of security products that protect businesses across their network, from firewall to desktop computers.""Malware gets through every day. When it does, you need to be able to watch it,"" said Cisco Vice President Scott Harrell.Proofpoint is benefiting from word of mouth among chief information officers, said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives. ""Email security has vaulted to the top of priority list for CIOs, and Proofpoint has established themselves as the clear leader,"" said Ives, who raised his target price for the company to $49 to $47 on March 10.For Proofpoint to continue its gains, management has to avoid the trap of email security firms made by expanding into other business lines, said Ives, the FBR analyst.""This is a high growth environment. The downfall of companies in the past is when they don't stay focused and try to expand into other areas,"" he said. ""If they stay focused, it's a green field opportunity.""(With additional reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Linda Stern, Richard Chang and Edwina Gibbs)",2014-03-18,MSFT,"Mon Mar 17, 2014 | 8:46pm EDT","As email threats multiply, funds pick up Proofpoint",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-proofpoint-funds-analysis-idUSBREA2G1IX20140318?type=companyNews,0.999,0.03,0.813,0.157

152,"   By Jussi Rosendahl | HELSINKI  HELSINKI Nokia does not expect to close the sale of its phone business to Microsoft until April as talks with Asian regulators drag on, it said on Monday, fuelling speculation it may have to make technology patent concessions to get the deal done.After selling its loss-making handset business, Nokia - which expected the deal to close this month - will derive more than 90 percent of sales from its telecom network unit, but its patent portfolio is seen as a promising source of future growth.As a phone maker, Nokia has paid rivals for the use of their licenses as well as charging for its own. A newly restructured Nokia would be freer to push up those fees, analysts say.Expected future revenue from patents make up as much as half Nokia's roughly 20-billion-euro market capitalization, they say.Google and Samsung Electronics have asked Chinese regulators to ensure the 5.4 billion euro ($7.4 billion) deal between Microsoft and Nokia would not lead to higher licensing fees, according to media reports.""(The delay) is a bad sign. They have been discussing with authorities for quite a while already, and they still need more time,"" Nordea Markets analyst Sami Sarkamies said. ""The biggest risk is in the upside of their patents. It looks like Nokia will have to make bigger concessions to push the deal through,"" he said.Nokia shares fell 0.7 percent to 5.24 euros by 1215 GMT.The Finnish firm said both companies remain committed to the deal, and Microsoft said it expects it to close next month. ""We are nearing the final stages of our global regulatory approval process,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said on the company's website. ""Currently we are awaiting approval confirmation in the final markets.""Nokia also reiterated that its tax disputes in India would not have an impact on the deal schedule.Indian authorities hit the company with a new $414 million tax claim last week, following a Supreme Court decision ordering Nokia to give a $571 million guarantee before transferring its Chennai factory to Microsoft. Pohjola Markets analyst Hannu Rauhala said Nokia and Microsoft had several options on how to deal with the tax issues while the antitrust problem was essentially out of their hands.""There is always the risk of further postponements (in deal closure). Based on the information they have given today, it can't be ruled out,"" he said.The time needed to close the deal, announced last September, is not exceptional for Microsoft, which took five months to complete its purchase of online chat company Skype in 2011. Nokia and Microsoft have already received approvals from the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice.Rauhala said that delays to the deal could also push forward Nokia's strategy update. Nokia had been expected to name a new chief executive and outline its new strategy after the deal.Along with its network unit and patents, future Nokia also includes its navigation software business HERE.(Additional reporting by Simon Johnson in Stockholm and Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Louise Ireland)",2014-03-24,MSFT,"Mon Mar 24, 2014 | 9:37am EDT",Microsoft deal delay may mean more Nokia patent concessions,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-nokia-microsoft-idUSBREA2N09920140324?type=companyNews,0.9636,0.034,0.897,0.07

The Finnish firm said both companies remain committed to the deal, and Microsoft said it expects it to close next month.""We are nearing the final stages of our global regulatory approval process,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel, said on the company's website. ""Currently we are awaiting approval confirmation in the final markets.""Nokia also reiterated that its tax disputes in India would not have an impact on the deal schedule. Indian authorities hit the company with a new $414 million tax claim last week, following a Supreme Court decision ordering Nokia to give a $571 million guarantee before transferring its Chennai factory to Microsoft.Pohjola Markets analyst Hannu Rauhala said Nokia and Microsoft had several options on how to deal with the tax issues while the antitrust problem was essentially out of their hands.""There is always the risk of further postponements (in deal closure). Based on the information they have given today, it can't be ruled out,"" he said.The time needed to close the deal, announced last September, is not exceptional for Microsoft, which took five months to complete its purchase of online chat company Skype in 2011. Nokia and Microsoft have already received approvals from the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice.Rauhala said that delays to the deal could also push forward Nokia's strategy update. Nokia had been expected to name a new chief executive and outline its new strategy after the deal.Along with its network unit and patents, future Nokia also includes its navigation software business HERE.

159,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Satya Nadella, the Indian-born self-described cricket fanatic who took over as Microsoft Corp's chief executive last month, makes his public debut on Thursday and is expected to go on the offensive right away with some bold strokes.When Nadella hosts his first major press conference this week, he's likely to describe - if not officially launch - versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint designed for Apple Inc's iPad, looking to cash in on a market worth up to $7 billion a year, according to Wall Street analysts.The technology behind the software is not ground-breaking, but the strategy is: It puts Office at the heart of the company's push to become a leading services company across a variety of platforms - possibly at the expense of Windows and its own Surface tablet.That perceived willingness to break with the Windows tradition, which remains co-founder Bill Gates' most enduring legacy, has helped spur Microsoft shares to $40-plus levels not seen since the dotcom boom of 2000.Wall Street is now guardedly optimistic on a company that, while still garnering billions of dollars in annual profit, risks gradual obsolescence in a mobile-powered tech industry.""The fact that Nadella is going to pull the trigger (on Office) shows he's not just an insider that's going to continue the status quo. Right now, it's a blank sheet of paper,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Depending what Microsoft charges for Office on the iPad, and how many of the scores of millions - and rising - iPad users adopt it, it could rake in anywhere between $840 million to $6.7 billion a year in revenue, estimates Raimo Lenschow, an analyst at Barclays. Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura who has urged Microsoft to put its most lucrative franchise on the iPad for some time, welcomed the idea but was more cautious on the rewards. He estimates that an iPad Office would generate only $1 billion or so in new revenue a year, as many potential users will already have corporate licenses that can be converted to the new product.And it's unclear how much of its revenue will be surrendered to Apple, which generally takes a 30 percent cut of app sales through its store. Microsoft and Apple declined comment.OPTIMISM BOOSTS SHARES The anticipation of Nadella's mobile-centric strategy has pushed Microsoft shares up 11 percent in the seven weeks since he took the helm, and they are now rolling along at 14-year highs. On Thursday, Nadella is officially slated to talk about mobile and cloud strategies. But investors and industry executives will be just as attuned to any signals from the new CEO on whether he's willing to take Microsoft in a radically different direction.To some investors, steering a new course for such a massive entity - Microsoft is the second-largest U.S. tech company by market value - is a daunting task. And some, who would rather have seen an energetic outsider like Ford Motor Co's Alan Mulally get the job, are yet to be convinced Nadella has the leverage to make the necessary change.But bold moves with Office, and signifying a renewed drive to conquer the mobile arena and 'cloud' computing after years of shackling its best products to PC-centric Windows, are seen as a promising start. ""This is something that should have happened a few years ago,"" said J.P. Gownder, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. ""Holding Office for iPad as a hostage in the tablet war didn't work out well for them. They have to start to undo this negative behavior.""Nadella has more work to do as well on the devices side of Microsoft's business plan. Windows-powered phones are well reviewed but held only 3 percent of the global smartphone market last year. Its Surface tablet, an iPad competitor, had 2 percent of the tablet market, according to tech research firm Gartner.Microsoft's $7.2 billion deal to buy the handset unit of Nokia, now delayed in closing, is unpopular with many investors who view it as a doomed defensive play to curb Google Inc's Android's dominance in the smartphone market.It is ""an acquisition not even a mother could love,"" according to Nomura's Sherlund.Wall Street will be listening for Nadella's thoughts on the Xbox, the subject of renewed spin-off talk recently, and his willingness to buy his way into cloud-based computing services exploited by growing startups such as Dropbox and Evernote.""M&A specifically on cloud is going to be key, around big data, cybersecurity, software-centric deals,"" said Ives at FBR.

164,"   By Abhirup Roy and Malathi Nayak  Video game retailer GameStop Corp on Thursday forecast full-year earnings below market expectations as it is yet to see an uptick in sagging video game software sales, despite robust hardware sales driven by the launches of Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4 consoles.GameStop shares fell as much as 9.3 percent, making the stock one of the top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange, before paring losses to close down 4.0 pct at $37.33.The Grapevine, Texas-based company, which reported a weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, had said in January that sales of games for older versions of Xbox and PlayStation consoles were weak.""Investors came into this quarter with high expectations of how new-generation consoles would drive sales of hardware and software,"" Morningstar analyst Liang Feng, said.""New software sales over the past few years have been turning downward. ... You're seeing some investors get jittery that maybe it's a structural trend that will continue.""In addition to uncertainty around sales of new games, GameStop's used-game business, historically its most profitable, will face new competition from retail giant Wal-Mart, which said last week it would allow U.S. shoppers to trade in used games for anything from groceries to gadgets. The used-game business involves refurbishing old games and selling them at a reduced rate.GameStop forecast full-year earnings of $3.40-$3.70 per share and revenue growth of 8-14 percent or about $9.76 billion-$10.30 billion. Analysts are expecting earnings of $3.76 per share on revenue of $9.85 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.""We've got through a very tough transitional quarter,"" Chief Executive Officer Paul Raines said in an interview. ""But we're very bullish on the (new)consoles."" GameStop's forecast reflects its expectations for strong sales of new video game hardware and a gradually improving software market making 2014 ""another transition year"", R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note.GameStop executives told investors in a conference call that a drop in software sales for older consoles had impacted its fourth-quarter results.The company's net profit fell to $220.5 million, or $1.89 per share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended February 1, from $261.1 million, or $2.15 per share, a year earlier.Revenue rose to $3.68 billion from $3.56 billion, helped mainly by demand for the new game consoles from Sony and Microsoft.

165,"  (Updates stock price, adds details from company and CEO comment)By Abhirup Roy and Malathi NayakMarch 27 Video game retailer GameStop Corp  on Thursday forecast full-year earnings below market expectations as it is yet to see an uptick in sagging video game software sales, despite robust hardware sales driven by the launches of Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4 consoles.GameStop shares fell as much as 9.3 percent, making the stock one of the top percentage losers on the New York Stock Exchange, before paring losses to close down 4.0 pct at $37.33.The Grapevine, Texas-based company, which reported a weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, had said in January that sales of games for older versions of Xbox and PlayStation consoles were weak.""Investors came into this quarter with high expectations of how new-generation consoles would drive sales of hardware and software,"" Morningstar analyst Liang Feng, said.""New software sales over the past few years have been turning downward. ... You're seeing some investors get jittery that maybe it's a structural trend that will continue.""In addition to uncertainty around sales of new games, GameStop's used-game business, historically its most profitable, will face new competition from retail giant Wal-Mart, which said last week it would allow U.S. shoppers to trade in used games for anything from groceries to gadgets. The used-game business involves refurbishing old games and selling them at a reduced rate.GameStop forecast full-year earnings of $3.40-$3.70 per share and revenue growth of 8-14 percent or about $9.76 billion-$10.30 billion. Analysts are expecting earnings of $3.76 per share on revenue of $9.85 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""We've got through a very tough transitional quarter,"" Chief Executive Officer Paul Raines said in an interview. ""But we're very bullish on the (new)consoles.""GameStop's forecast reflects its expectations for strong sales of new video game hardware and a gradually improving software market making 2014 ""another transition year"", R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note.GameStop executives told investors in a conference call that a drop in software sales for older consoles had impacted its fourth-quarter results.The company's net profit fell to $220.5 million, or $1.89 per share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Feb. 1, from $261.1 million, or $2.15 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $3.68 billion from $3.56 billion, helped mainly by demand for the new game consoles from Sony and Microsoft.Excluding one-time items, GameStop earned $1.90 per share, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.92, on revenue of $3.79 billion.GameStop shares, which traded at $25.30 a year ago, hit a 52-week high of $57.74 in mid-November when Sony and Microsoft released their new consoles.The company said on Thursday that it has shut its Spawn Labs unit, which it acquired in 2011 to develop online game-streaming technology.

170,"   By Gerry Shih and Bill Rigby | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Corp's new Chief Executive Officer, Satya Nadella, finally unveiled Office for Apple Inc's iPad in a polished debut that set him apart from his energetic predecessor while signaling his plans to make mobile apps the top priority at the world's largest software company.At a news conference Thursday, executives demonstrated a new ""touch-first"" version of Office crafted for the iPad, available for download as a free app, though a subscription is needed to let users create or edit documents rather than just read them.Significantly, they did not demonstrate any software on Windows machines, telegraphing a departure from former Chief Executive Steve Ballmer's focus on the personal computer operating software and its own devices.""Their absence speaks volumes,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""Nadella's a cloud-centric guy; he's going to focus on what's been successful, and where the future's going. Windows 8 thus far has been extremely underwhelming.""Nadella kicked off the presentation with a fluid, low-key introduction to Microsoft's approach to the new mobile, cloud-centric world of computing, in his first public appearance since taking the helm 52 days ago.Dressed in a black polo shirt and dark jeans, the 46-year-old computer scientist threw in some geek humor and lines of poetry from T.S. Eliot, marking a change in style from his energetic predecessor Steve Ballmer. His lack of references to Windows indicated a deeper strategic shift.Nadella gave no indication of when Microsoft would release ""touch-first"" versions of Office apps for Windows 8, the latest version of the operating software, which he acknowledged had fallen behind in the mobile era.""The Windows strategy, there's no change, except we want to be known as the innovative company that's coming from behind in some categories,"" Nadella told reporters in an ad hoc question and answer session after the presentation, another sign of new openness at the company. ""If you look at the story of Windows, we lead in some, we have fallen behind in some. We're grounded in that reality,"" he said. ""What we need to be is a challenger there and be able to show what we're capable of doing in these new form factors.""Apart from the absence of any Windows devices, the Surface, one of Ballmer's prized concepts, was conspicuously missing from a show floor at the event that included Google Inc Android tablets from Samsung and Acer as well as the iPad. Nadella did not mention the poor-selling tablet at all in conversations with reporters.OFFICE, AT LAST The Office apps are free to download from Apple's app store, but to create new documents, users will need a subscription to Microsoft's existing cloud-based service called Office 365.Microsoft's Office 365 Home Premium, designed for home consumers, costs $100 a year. For businesses it costs $60 or more per year, depending on features. Apple gets its standard 30 percent cut of new Office 365 Home subscriptions sold through its app store, but no share of existing Office 365 revenue or multiple subscriptions bought by companies. That is analogous to the way Apple treats magazine subscriptions.""Welcome to the #iPad and @AppStore!"" Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook tweeted after the announcement. ""Thanks @tim_cook, excited to bring the magic of @Office to iPad customers,"" Nadella tweeted back.Analysts have estimated that Microsoft could rake in anywhere from $840 million to $6.7 billion a year in revenue from iPad-native Office, although some fear it may have moved too late to grab the attention of many.Easy to use, touch-friendly work apps like Haiku Deck, Quip, Smartsheet and Evernote, not to mention Google Apps, have quickly gained a following among younger users who have never worked with Office applications, or relish the change. Sources have said an iPad-friendly version of Office - which encompasses such popular applications as Word, Excel and PowerPoint - had been ready for years, but the Redmond, Washington-based company had been reluctant to compromise its signature PC operating system. At the time, the sources could not speak because they were not authorized to talk to the press.However, Microsoft's own efforts to produce a touch-friendly operating system capable of challenging the iPad have floundered, with poor sales of its Surface tablet, and a general lack of interest from third party hardware makers in making tablets running Windows 8.Nadella's willingness to break with the Windows tradition, which remains co-founder Bill Gates' most enduring legacy, helped spur Microsoft shares to $40-plus levels not seen since the dotcom boom of 2000.Wall Street is now guardedly optimistic on a company that, while still garnering billions of dollars in annual profit, risks gradual obsolescence in a mobile-powered tech industry.To some investors, steering a new course for such a massive entity - Microsoft is the second-largest U.S. tech company by market value - is a daunting task. Before Nadella's appointment, some investors had hoped for an outsider open to change to take the reins.But bold moves with Office, and signifying a renewed drive to conquer the mobile arena and 'cloud' computing after years of shackling its best products to PC-centric Windows, are seen as a promising start.""He talks the talk,"" said Ives at FBR, referring to Nadella. ""Now the big question is, will he walk the walk?""(Reporting by Gerry Shih and Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Bernard Orr and Richard Chang)",2014-03-28,MSFT,"Thu Mar 27, 2014 | 11:24pm EDT",Microsoft CEO signals new course with Office for iPad,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-microsoft-office-ipad-idUSBREA2Q1MV20140328?type=companyNews,0.9957,0.036,0.859,0.105

173,"  (Adds Trend Micro declined to comment and background, paragraphs 7-8, 11)By Dan LevineApril 1 Intellectual Ventures can seek hundreds of millions of dollars in damages on a patent it bought for less than $1 million, a federal judge ruled on Monday, handing the patent acquisition firm a victory in a key attack on its business model.A multibillion-dollar company that virtually invented a new market for patents, Intellectual Ventures accused Internet security companies Symantec and Trend Micro in 2010 of infringing its intellectual property. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Delaware, includes a patent on technology that helps detect malicious software embedded in digital content.IV bought the patent for $750,000 and is currently seeking at least $310 million in damages from the two companies. Symantec and Trend Micro asked U.S. District Judge Leonard Stark to bar IV from seeking such large licensing fees on the grounds that a patent acquired for so little couldn't possibly be worth so much.The argument threatened IV and other patent acquisition firms whose primary business depends on buying patents to win licensing fees, instead of manufacturing products. IV argued that the figure represents fair compensation given how extensively Symantec and Trend Micro products rely on the technology. In a brief order on Monday, Stark denied Symantec's motion to exclude IV's damages argument from the case.A detailed ruling from Stark was filed on the court docket but was not publicly available on Tuesday. Representatives from Symantec, Trend Micro and IV declined to comment. Since its founding in 2000, privately held IV has raised about $6 billion from investors and argues that it creates an organized mechanism for innovators of all stripes to capitalize on their ideas. IV's investors include major tech companies like Microsoft and Apple.Over the years, though, IV and other firms like it have faced criticism from the technology industry, which argues that patent litigation and royalty payments have become a burdensome tax on innovation, and that firms like IV that do not primarily make products are exploiting the patent system.The debate has caught fire in the U.S. Congress, where a proposal to make it easier to fight patent lawsuits passed the House of Representatives last year and is currently pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee. In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday heard arguments in a case that could impose new guidelines on how the government issues software patents. [IED:nL1N0MS0S4]Two other software security firms that IV sued, Intel Corp's McAfee unit and Check Point Software Technologies Ltd, both settled on undisclosed terms. Symantec and Trend Micro chose to fight, though no trial date has been set.The case in U.S. District Court, District of Delaware is Intellectual Ventures vs. Check Point Software et al., 10-1067.(Reporting by Dan Levine in San Jose, California; Editing by Eric Walsh and Leslie Adler)",2014-04-01,MSFT,"Tue Apr 1, 2014 | 6:27pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Intellectual Ventures defeats challenge to its patent business,http://www.reuters.com//article/iv-symantec-ruling-idUSL1N0MT23820140401?type=companyNews,-0.9266,0.123,0.791,0.086
174,"   By Bill Rigby | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Corp is to give away its Windows operating system to makers of smartphones and small tablets for consumers as it seeks to make more of an impact on those fast-growing markets and counter the massive success of Google Inc's free Android platform.Microsoft's move, announced at its annual developers conference in San Francisco, is an attempt to broaden the small user base of mobile versions of Windows, in the hope that more customers will end up using Microsoft's money-making, cloud-based services such as Skype and Office.Up to now, Microsoft has charged phone and tablet makers between $5 and $15 per device to use its Windows system, as it has done successfully at higher prices for many years with Windows on personal computers. Hardware makers factor the cost of that into the sale price of each device.That model has been obliterated in the past few years by the fast adoption of Google's Android system for phones and tablets, which hardware makers quickly embraced and now accounts for more than 75 percent of all smartphones sold last year. Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad account for most of the rest of the mobile computing market.By contrast, Windows-powered phones held only 3 percent of the global smartphone market last year. Windows tablets have only about 2 percent of the tablet market, according to tech research firm Gartner.FREE MONEY Microsoft's move to make Windows free for some consumer devices bucks a central tenet of Bill Gates' original philosophy, that software should be paid for, which led to Microsoft's massive financial success over the last four decades. But analysts said it is a realistic reaction to the runaway success of free Android. ""Microsoft is facing challenges on the mobile and tablet fronts and need to change their strategy to move the growth needle, this is a good and logical first step,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Windows will be free for companies making phones and tablets with screen sizes under nine inches for the consumer market. A license fee will still apply for business devices.It comes a week after new Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella unveiled new versions of Word, PowerPoint and Excel applications for Apple Inc's iPad. A year's free subscription to Microsoft's cloud-based Office 365 service will be offered on the new devices running the free Windows, Microsoft said.Both moves show that Microsoft is now more interested in gaining market share for its cloud-based services such as Office on any platform or device, rather than its traditional approach of putting Windows at the center of everything it does and extending its influence from there. In the new era of mobile computing, Nadella acknowledged Microsoft's underdog status.""We are going to innovate with a challenger mindset,"" said Nadella in a question and answer session at the developer conference. ""We are not coming at this as some incumbent trying to do the next version of Windows, we are going to come at this by innovating in every dimension.""Nadella did not have a snappy answer to the question of what Microsoft's overarching mission now was, after it had achieved its original goal of putting a computer on every desk and in every home. Instead he elaborated on remarks he made last week about the importance of mobile devices as everything we do becomes digitized and connected to the internet. ""Our vision, simply put, is to thrive in this world of mobile first, cloud first,"" said Nadella. ""Our goal is to really build platforms, create the best end-user experiences, the best developer opportunities and IT infrastructure for this ubiquitous computing world.""SIRI RIVAL Also at the gathering, Microsoft formally announced it has developed a voice activated phone assistant feature called Cortana, a direct rival to Apple's Siri.The feature has been rumored for some months and a test version was demonstrated at the event by Joe Belfiore, a Windows Phone executive.The Cortana service, which can take verbal instructions to search the Web, set alarms, make calls and a host of other actions, is still in beta testing but will soon be a standard feature on Windows phones, said Belfiore.He announced that the latest version of Microsoft's smartphone software, called Windows Phone 8.1, will be rolled out to consumers as a downloadable upgrade in the next few months, and new phones running the software will be in stores by late April or early May.(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by David Gregorio and Andrew Hay)",2014-04-02,MSFT,"Wed Apr 2, 2014 | 4:59pm EDT","Microsoft to offer Windows for free on phones, tablets",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-microsoft-windows-idUSBREA311OX20140402?type=companyNews,0.9883,0.007,0.92,0.073

But analysts said it is a realistic reaction to the runaway success of free Android.""Microsoft is facing challenges on the mobile and tablet fronts and need to change their strategy to move the growth needle, this is a good and logical first step,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Windows will be free for companies making phones and tablets with screen sizes under nine inches (23 cm) for the consumer market. A license fee will still apply for business devices.It comes a week after new Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella unveiled new versions of Word, PowerPoint and Excel applications for Apple Inc's iPad. A year's free subscription to Microsoft's cloud-based Office 365 service will be offered on the new devices running the free Windows, Microsoft said. Both moves show that Microsoft is now more interested in gaining market share for its cloud-based services such as Office on any platform or device, rather than its traditional approach of putting Windows at the center of everything it does and extending its influence from there.In the new era of mobile computing, Nadella acknowledged Microsoft's underdog status.""We are going to innovate with a challenger mindset,"" said Nadella in a question and answer session at the developer conference. ""We are not coming at this as some incumbent trying  to do the next version of Windows, we are going to come at this by innovating in every dimension.""Nadella did not have a snappy answer to the question of what Microsoft's overarching mission now was, after it had achieved its original goal of putting a computer on every desk and in every home. Instead he elaborated on remarks he made last week about the importance of mobile devices as everything we do becomes digitized and connected to the internet. ""Our vision, simply put, is to thrive in this world of mobile first, cloud first,"" said Nadella. ""Our goal is to really build platforms, create the best end-user experiences, the best developer opportunities and IT infrastructure for this ubiquitous computing world.""SIRI RIVAL Also at the gathering, Microsoft formally announced it has developed a voice activated phone assistant feature called Cortana, a direct rival to Apple's Siri.The feature has been rumored for some months and a test version was demonstrated at the event by Joe Belfiore, a Windows Phone executive.The Cortana service, which can take verbal instructions to search the Web, set alarms, make calls and a host of other actions, is still in beta testing but will soon be a standard feature on Windows phones, said Belfiore.He announced that the latest version of Microsoft's smartphone software, called Windows Phone 8.1, will be rolled out to consumers as a downloadable upgrade in the next few months, and new phones running the software will be in stores by late April or early May.

179,"   By Rachel Armstrong and Andrew Toh | SINGAPORE  SINGAPORE China should do more to encourage wealthy Chinese to donate to charitable causes and to make philanthropy a common practice in the world's most populous country, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates said on Sunday.Gates, who runs the $38 billion Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, said he thought people in China would take cues from central leadership on donations and worthy causes.""When you have something like a disaster (in China) you see the basic generosity, but if you look at systemic things like giving to health causes, giving to universities to do research, giving to handicapped people, it's not there yet,"" Gates told Reuters in Singapore.Governments should consider introducing policies that would encourage potential donors, such as making charity donations tax deductible, he said.According to the World Bank, the average income per capita in China was $6,091 in 2012. But the country's rapid economic growth has mainly benefited those in cities, with people in many rural areas living on annual incomes below $1000 and struggling with access to adequate healthcare. Despite the huge wealth creation seen in Asia over the past decade, philanthropy has not taken off. Charitable activities focus mostly on local causes.Gates, along with fellow billionaire Warren Buffett made headlines in 2010 when they asked 50 of China's richest people to a philanthropy dinner and a third turned the invitation down, reportedly due to fears they would be pressed to donate money. Donations by China's top 100 philanthropists in 2013 fell to$890 million, a 44 percent drop from 2012, according to the Hurun Report. The previous year donations fell by 55 percent.Among the possible reasons cited for the sharp decline in donations was a number of scandals involving charities in China that led to concern over possible misuse of funds. The World Giving Index, compiled by the Charities Aid Foundation, ranked China 133 out of 135 countries surveyed when it ranked the percentage of people who give money to charity, volunteer or have helped a stranger.Gates and Buffett are encouraging billionaires to give away at least half their wealth during their lifetime through their ""Giving Pledge"". Fewer than ten Asian billionaires have added their name to the list so far.There are now 444 billionaires in Asia, according to Forbes magazine.(Reporting by Rachel Armstrong and Andrew Toh; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky)",2014-04-06,MSFT,"Sun Apr 6, 2014 | 8:58am EDT",Bill Gates wants China to encourage wealthy Chinese to be more giving,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-singapore-gates-idUSBREA3509120140406?type=companyNews,0.9961,0.044,0.77,0.186
180,"  * Senate Finance Committee Chairman Wyden calls for reform* Total of profits stashed abroad up 93 percent 2008-2013* GE tops list, followed by Microsoft, Pfizer, Merck, AppleBy Kevin Drawbaugh and Patrick Temple-WestWASHINGTON, April 8 Foreign profits held overseas by U.S. corporations to avoid taxes at home nearly doubled from 2008 to 2013 to top $2.1 trillion, said a private research firm's report, prompting a call for reform by the Senate's top tax law writer.""The new numbers ... certainly highlight what is one of the key challenges for tax reform. I do think there need to be some reforms in this area,"" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden told reporters on Tuesday on Capitol Hill.Under U.S. law, corporations do not have to pay income tax on most of their overseas profits until they are brought into the United States. These earnings can be held offshore for years if they are classified as indefinitely invested abroad. Research firm Audit Analytics said in a report issued last week that the total of such earnings was up 93 percent from 2008 to 2013, citing federal financial filings for companies listed in the Russell 1000 index of U.S. corporations.Conglomerate General Electric Co had the biggest pile of earnings stored abroad, at $110 billion, the firm said.Next were software maker Microsoft Corp, with $76.4 billion; drugmakers Pfizer Inc, with $69 billion, and Merck & Co Inc, with $57.1 billion; and high-tech group Apple Inc, with $54.4 billion, it said.In response, GE said in a statement: ""GE operates in more than 170 countries, and most of these overseas earnings have been reinvested in active business operations like manufacturing facilities and loans to non-U.S. customers."" Microsoft, Merck and Pfizer were not immediately available for comment. Apple did not respond to requests for comment.BAUCUS AND WYDEN  Congress has quarreled for years over the law that lets multinationals stash profits abroad tax-free. Some favor killing the law - known as offshore corporate income tax deferral - and some back a one-time tax holiday that would let companies bring foreign profits home, or ""repatriate"" them, at a low tax rate.Debate over offshore deferral flared again in November when Wyden's predecessor as finance committee chairman, former Democratic Senator Max Baucus, proposed doing both. Baucus resigned weeks later to become U.S. ambassador to China.Wyden in the past has called for repeal of offshore deferral, along with a repatriation holiday, among other changes to the tax code, which he last month called ""a rotten carcass that the special interests feast on.""No decisive action is likely for now, however, with Congress deadlocked over fiscal issues at least until after the November mid-term congressional elections, according to policy analysts.Next year lawmakers are likely to mount another push to overhaul the tax code, a politically difficult feat that has not been pulled off since 1986, when Republican President Ronald Reagan and a divided Congress managed to get it done.The top U.S. corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, though few multinationals pay anywhere near that thanks to tax-reducing loopholes written into the code in the past 28 years, including some that have enabled wider use of offshore deferral.

186,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft Corp's board faces a lawsuit over the way it handled an error with its Internet Explorer browser that ended up costing the company a record-breaking $731 million fine by European antitrust regulators.The lawsuit, brought by shareholder Kim Barovic in federal court in Seattle on Friday, charges that directors and executives, including founder Bill Gates and former Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, failed to manage the company properly and that the board's investigation was insufficient into how the miscue occurred.The legal action is the first to emerge from a humiliating episode for Microsoft, which the software company has never fully explained and has accounted for only as a ""technical error.""In March last year, the European Union levied its largest ever antitrust fine against Microsoft for breaking a legally binding commitment made in 2009 to ensure that consumers in Europe had a choice of how they access the internet, rather than defaulting to Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser. Its investigation found that updated software issued between May 2011 and July 2012 meant that 15 million users were not given a choice. It was the first time the European Commission, the EU's antitrust authority, handed down a fine to a company for failing to meet its obligations.In her lawsuit, Barovic says she asked Microsoft's board to fully investigate how that mistake occurred and to take action against any directors or executives that had not performed their duties. She says Microsoft replied that it found no evidence of a breach of fiduciary duty by any current or former executives or directors. In a statement on Friday, Microsoft repeated that stance.""Ms. Barovic asked the board to investigate her demand and bring a lawsuit against the board and company executives,"" said an emailed statement from Microsoft. ""The board thoroughly considered her demand as she requested and found no basis for such a suit."" The problem on European computers prevented the so-called ""ballot"" screen from appearing. Sources close to the company have said it was connected to updated Windows 7 software.Ballmer, who was CEO at the time, and Steven Sinofsky, then the head of the Windows unit, both had their bonuses cut in 2012 after the error came to light.The case is Barovic v Ballmer et al in U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 14-00540(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Grant McCool)",2014-04-11,MSFT,"Fri Apr 11, 2014 | 6:32pm EDT",Microsoft sued over browser miscue that led to $731 million EU fine,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-microsoft-browser-lawsuit-idUSBREA3A1YI20140411?type=companyNews,-0.9493,0.099,0.847,0.054
187,"  (Adds analysts' comment and detail on Internet stocks)By Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, April 11 The last six weeks have been terrible for many technology shares, but not for the four horsemen that sat atop the last tech boom.Intel, Oracle, Microsoft and Cisco, known as the four horsemen during the late 1990s technology boom due to their strong performance and leading market share, have all rallied since the beginning of March even as stocks of many other tech companies have been crushed.These legacy names have emerged as an alternative for those who want exposure to the tech sector but are spooked by the  slump in high-growth stocks like Netflix.These older names have recently attracted more attention because their growth outpaces the broader market but they don't have the high valuations of the recent momentum favorites.""They have high cash levels, nice profit margins, and when the economy returns, their cyclicality will be a positive,""     said Robert Stimpson, portfolio manager at Oak Associates Ltd in Akron, Ohio.""That they're trading at a discount makes them something of a defensive play,"" he added. ""I'd rather own them than something like utilities, which pay a dividend but offer little or no growth."" GO WITH THE FLOW The change in sentiment can be seen in fund flow figures. The First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF has seen outflows of $43.86 million since the beginning of March, while the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology fund -- which counts Facebook as a holding but holds few other ""momentum"" names -- has seen inflows of $9.4 million over that same period, according to data from ETF.com.While the likes of Netflix and TripAdvisor have lost more than 20 percent of their market value, putting them in bear market territory, Dow components Intel Corp and Cisco Systems are up 5.7 percent and 3 percent, respectively, since the beginning of March. Microsoft Corp  is up 2.3 percent over that time and is trading near its highest levels since the dot-com bubble. These stocks are considered undervalued by various measures, including StarMine's measurement of intrinsic value, which looks at anticipated growth over the next decade. Many of the high-flyers still look pricey, meanwhile.Both Netflix and Facebook would still be above StarMine's intrinsic value measure even if their shares fell another 50 percent from current levels. However, IBM is almost 40 percent under its intrinsic value, based on its Friday closing price, while Microsoft and Oracle are more than 20 percent under.Another class of shares walloped in the recent selloff are ""cloud"" or Internet-software plays.Human resources software provider Workday has given up 25 percent of its value over the past month. The sell-off has been more brutal on its peers: since mid-February, accounting services provider Netsuite has fallen close to 30 percent, while analytics firms Splunk Inc and Tableau Software Inc have both shed close to 40 percent of their value. ""We've seen a very vicious correction in March and April and it doesn't look like it's over yet,"" Wedbush analyst Steve Koenig said. ""The sell-off was fueled by initially by profit-taking and then it became a momentum trade to the downside.""""The fact that the multiples had expanded so much just created the conditions for that trade to happen.""Valuations still look stretched. Workday, which has not reported a profit since it went public in 2012, is trading at close to 30 times sales. That compares to roughly 23 times for Splunk and 15 times for Netsuite. Salesforce.com Inc, in comparison, has a price-to-sales ratio of 8.2.Still, many analysts say the case for cloud software companies remains on solid footing. A report released this month by research firm IHS estimated that cloud-related spending will balloon to $235 billion by 2017 - up 35 percent from the $174 billion projected for 2014.Straddling the line between growth and value is Apple Inc , Wall Street's most valuable company. While the stock is trading well under its intrinsic value, it is well below record levels hit in 2012, suggesting investors remain skeptical that its shares have the ability to recover. The stock has slipped 1.3 percent since the start of March, underperforming other legacy names but far better than the Nasdaq's 7.2 percent drop over the period.Mark Yusko, chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, said Apple was an ""in-betweener"" stock.""It has growth, but not as much growth as other tech names, while also not trading at the multiples of others,"" said Yusko, who oversees about $4 billion in assets and whose firm owns Apple.

188,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE, April 11  SEATTLE, April 11 Microsoft Corp's  board faces a lawsuit over the way it handled an error with its Internet Explorer browser that ended up costing the company a record-breaking $731 million fine by European antitrust regulators.The lawsuit, brought by shareholder Kim Barovic in federal court in Seattle on Friday, charges that directors and executives, including founder Bill Gates and former Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, failed to manage the company properly and that the board's investigation was insufficient into how the miscue occurred.The legal action is the first to emerge from a humiliating episode for Microsoft, which the software company has never fully explained and has accounted for only as a ""technical error.""In March last year, the European Union levied its largest ever antitrust fine against Microsoft for breaking a legally binding commitment made in 2009 to ensure that consumers in Europe had a choice of how they access the internet, rather than defaulting to Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser. Its investigation found that updated software issued between May 2011 and July 2012 meant that 15 million users were not given a choice. It was the first time the European Commission, the EU's antitrust authority, handed down a fine to a company for failing to meet its obligations.In her lawsuit, Barovic says she asked Microsoft's board to fully investigate how that mistake occurred and to take action against any directors or executives that had not performed their duties. She says Microsoft replied that it found no evidence of a breach of fiduciary duty by any current or former executives or directors. In a statement on Friday, Microsoft repeated that stance.""Ms. Barovic asked the board to investigate her demand and bring a lawsuit against the board and company executives,"" said an emailed statement from Microsoft. ""The board thoroughly considered her demand as she requested and found no basis for such a suit."" The problem on European computers prevented the so-called ""ballot"" screen from appearing. Sources close to the company have said it was connected to updated Windows 7 software.Ballmer, who was CEO at the time, and Steven Sinofsky, then the head of the Windows unit, both had their bonuses cut in 2012 after the error came to light.The case is Barovic v Ballmer et al in U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 14-00540   (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Grant McCool)",2014-04-11,MSFT,"Fri Apr 11, 2014 | 6:29pm EDT",Microsoft sued over browser miscue that led to $731 mln EU fine,http://www.reuters.com//article/microsoft-browser-lawsuit-idUSL2N0N324B20140411?type=companyNews,-0.9493,0.098,0.849,0.053

191,"   By Ryan Vlastelica | NEW YORK, April 11  NEW YORK, April 11 The last six weeks have been terrible for many technology shares, but not for the four horsemen that sat atop the last tech boom.Intel, Oracle, Microsoft and Cisco, known as the four horsemen during the late 1990s technology boom due to their strong performance and leading market share, have all rallied since the beginning of March even as many other tech companies' stocks have been crushed.These legacy tech names have emerged as an alternative for those who want exposure to the sector, but are spooked by the  slump in high-growth stocks like Netflix.These old tech names have recently attracted more attention because their growth outpaces the broader market but they don't have the high valuations of the one-time momentum favorites.""They have high cash levels, nice profit margins, and when the economy returns, their cyclicality will be a positive,""     Robert Stimpson, portfolio manager at Oak Associates Ltd in Akron, Ohio. ""That they're trading at a discount makes them something of a defensive play,"" he added. ""I'd rather own them than something like utilities, which pay a dividend but offer little or no growth.""GO WITH THE FLOW  It can be seen in fund flow figures. The First Trust Dow Jones Internet ETF has seen outflows of $43.86 million since the beginning of March, while the First Trust Nasdaq 100 Technology fund - which counts Facebook as a holding but holds few other ""momentum"" names - has seen inflows of $9.4 million over that same period, according to data from ETF.com.While the likes of Netflix and TripAdvisor have lost more than 20 percent, putting them in bear market territory, Dow components Intel Corp and Cisco Systems are up 5.7 percent and 3 percent, respectively, since the beginning of March. Microsoft Corp is up 2.3 percent over that time and is trading near its highest levels since the dot-com bubble. These stocks are also considered undervalued by various measures, including StarMine's measurement of intrinsic value, which looks at anticipated growth over the next decade. Many of the high-flyers still look pricey, meanwhile.Both Netflix and Facebook would still be above StarMine's intrinsic value measure even if their shares fell 50 percent. However, IBM is almost 40 percent under its intrinsic value, based on its Friday closing price, while Microsoft and Oracle are more than 20 percent under.Straddling the line between growth and value is Apple Inc , Wall Street's biggest tech company. While the stock is trading well under its intrinsic value, it also remains well below record levels hit in 2012, suggesting investors remain skeptical that its shares have the ability to recover. The stock has slipped 1.3 percent since the start of March, underperforming other legacy names but far better than the Nasdaq's 7.2 percent drop over the period.Mark Yusko, chief investment officer of Morgan Creek Capital Management in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, said the iPhone maker was an ""in-betweener"" stock.""It has growth, but not as much growth as other tech names, while also not trading at the multiples of others,"" said Yusko, who oversees about $4 billion in assets and whose firm owns Apple. ""It has the best of both worlds, and also the worst of both.""

193,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Patent buyer Intellectual Ventures has persuaded Microsoft and Sony to invest in its latest acquisition fund while Apple and Intel, which invested with IV previously, declined to participate, according to people briefed on the fundraising.The investment decisions by four technology companies come in the midst of a heated debate over whether it is too easy for patent owners to extract large royalty payments, and whether patent buying firms spur or stifle innovation.Last year IV curtailed patent acquisitions as it sought new investors, and IV now is ramping up, say three sources familiar with IV's activity in the patent market.""Microsoft and Sony's investments give IV a fresh war chest to buy new patents,"" said Kevin Jakel, chief executive of Unified Patents, which advises tech companies on alternatives to patent aggregators like IV.But Apple and Intel's decision is significant because the biggest tech companies have supported IV in the past. ""This would be a dramatic departure,"" Jakel said.Intellectual Ventures declined to discuss investments. Microsoft, Sony, Intel and Apple also would not comment. It is unclear whether Intel and Apple could still opt to invest in IV's vehicle at a later time.Created in 2000, Intellectual Ventures has raised about $6 billion and acquired 70,000 patents and other intellectual property assets. The company is seeking to raise $3 billion more, a 2013 investor presentation reviewed by Reuters shows. Over the years IV and other firms like it have faced criticism from some in the technology industry, who argue that firms like IV, which do not primarily make products, exploit the patent system by demanding royalties and threatening litigation.IV argues that by buying patents from inventors, it creates a mechanism for them to capitalize on their ideas. Several large tech companies previously invested in IV, which gave them low-cost licenses to IV's vast patent portfolios as well as a portion of royalties IV collected.Microsoft Corp, Sony Corp, Apple and Intel all invested in IV's previous funds, court filings show. Prior to co-founding IV, Nathan Myhrvold was chief technology officer at Microsoft working closely with Bill Gates. Another IV co-founder, Peter Detkin, was previously an Intel in-house lawyer. IV's fundraising comes as a proposal to make it easier to fight patent lawsuits passed the House of Representatives last year and is currently pending in the Senate Judiciary Committee.Some companies like Google Inc publicly supported the bill, which included a provision to make it easier for the winner of a patent lawsuit to recover legal fees. Google invested in IV's first fund in 2003 but has said it declined to participate in subsequent ventures. IV sued Google's Motorola Mobility unit in 2011, and that litigation is ongoing.Microsoft and Apple were among seven major corporations which warned last week against weakening the patent system and hurting innovative companies. Still, Microsoft reiterated on Friday that it ""applauds"" the pending bill.Amy Landers, an intellectual property professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law, said Apple and Intel's decision on IV's latest fund was probably unrelated to the political debate on patent reform. ""The companies that are not investing in the fund have probably just found better uses for their money,"" Landers said.At the end of 2012 the average rate of return for IV's 2003 fund was 16.2 percent, while the 2008 fund stood at 2.5 percent, according to the 2013 investor presentation. In a court filing last year, Intellectual Ventures said it has earned more than $3 billion to date in licensing fees.Patent buyers also are facing some competition from companies like Unified Patents, which argue that tech companies should try to invalidate threatening patents instead of just financing aggregators like IV to acquire them.""I think there's a recognition by a lot of companies that simply trying to buy your way out of the problem is like bailing water from a sinking ship,"" Jakel said.Jakel declined to disclose whether any of the tech companies in this report are clients.(Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in San Francisco and Reiji Murai in Tokyo, editing by Peter Henderson, Bernard Orr)",2014-04-11,MSFT,"Fri Apr 11, 2014 | 2:27pm EDT","Exclusive: Microsoft, Apple diverge on bankrolling big patent buyer",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-microsoft-apple-patents-idUSBREA3A0R020140411?type=companyNews,0.9666,0.056,0.853,0.09
194,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By John WasikCHICAGO, April 14 A resounding shot across the bow has been fired at the tech sector in recent weeks. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index is down nearly 5 percent in April through Friday's close and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is off 21 percent from its record closing high on Feb. 25. Many of the sector's flagships and newcomers have been in the crosshairs.The latest tech stock falterings could be a sign of trouble ahead.To get a clearer idea of what's roiling the tech sector, you have to look at trends within various parts of it.One item to look at is data storage, which is offered by Amazon.com Inc  and Google Inc and has been the object of a price war of late. While falling prices in this sub-sector are great for customers, they will eat into profits for competing companies.Brian Bolan, a portfolio manager and equity strategist for Zacks Investments in Chicago, surmises that the storage price war is partially responsible for the delay of initial public offerings of companies like Dropbox and Boxee. Tech companies' valuations, particularly those that are barely profitable, may be the object of inflated expectations of future business and earnings because they often engender irrational exuberance. Witness the dot-com bubble of more than a decade ago.Today's valuations may not wreck as much havoc if they end up having a correction, according to a recent Citi Private Bank bulletin, which notes that current tech ""speculative growth expectations are a far less profound influence on the overall U.S. stock market than was the case in 1999-2000.""That doesn't mean that the next few months won't be rocky for tech shares and the market in general. The year started with a broad-based selloff, and the current bull market may be long in the tooth in its fifth year.""Valuations become more reasonable before investors do,"" Bolan adds, ""But volatility is definitely something you're going to see."" CUT RISK Although diversification is usually a good idea in any sector, it won't guarantee you protection from tech's always-skittish volatility. One way to cut the risk of the sector is to invest in a broad-based index fund. Although you won't avoid a widespread selloff, there may be safety in numbers as most index funds give more weight to the older, more established dividend-paying companies with consistent earnings.The Vanguard Information Technology ETF, for example, owns cash-rich Apple Inc, Google and Microsoft Corp in addition to older stalwarts like International Business Machines Corp  and Intel Corp. The fund is up nearly 22 percent for the year through April 11. It charges 0.14 percent in annual management expenses.Another option is the iShares Technology ETF, which is up 3 percent year to date and has gained about 22 percent for the prior 12 months through April 11, but charges more than the Vanguard fund at 0.46 percent in annual expenses. The fund's weighting in the top tech stocks is slightly different than Vanguard's, with more than one-third of its holdings in Apple, Google and Microsoft.If you want to stay in tech stocks, to ratchet down exposure to the biggest names in this rambunctious sector, you should consider an equal-weighted fund that doesn't concentrate its holdings in the most popular stocks, such as the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal-Weighted Technology ETF, which is up 26 percent for the 12 months through April 11. The fund holds less than 2 percent (each) in stocks like First Solar Inc, Seagate Technology and Teradata Corp.While pundits have mixed opinions on whether the latest tech troubles will spill over into the broader stock market, it's likely that there's more volatility ahead and it will become even more difficult to tell when it's a good time to buy.While tech stocks benefited from the broad-based gains of the larger U.S. stock market last year, they won't be immune from a wider selloff. They still make sense long-term in an information/technology intensive economy, although short-term they will always be volatile. You might see some bargain pricing if the sector goes into a full-blown correction. Those attempting to time the sector or leery of this ever-skittish sector might want to seek some safer harbors.

197,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Earnings season shifts into high gear next week, and with nearly one-third of S&P 500 names set to post results, investors hope the news provides a catalyst to buy stocks and leave the market's recent weakness in the dust.Several behemoths, including Apple, the largest U.S. company by market value, as well as Microsoft, McDonald's (MCD.N) and AT&T (T.N), are due to report earnings.They'll be accompanied by highfliers like Netflix and Facebook, giving the first real cross-section of the state of corporate America as temperatures rise across the country and investors hope to put the cold weather behind them. Strategists will also be looking for clues on how badly China's slowdown hits U.S. corporate results.The first batch of earnings came out as equities were working their way through a selloff led by trading-crowd favorites like Netflix and the biotech stocks. With the late-week recovery, the hope is that the recent volatility has ebbed. If poor results dominate next week's action, that could reignite the selling.""We are still off our highs, but we still remain in an uptrend so it would not surprise me to see sideways action,"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey.""If we were to have a set of earnings releases that were well off expectations to the downside, that could create hesitation in the market.""A few themes will dominate in the coming week: The outlook for China, the rotation to slower-growing stocks, and results from high-flying trading favorites.S&P 500 companies' first-quarter earnings are projected to have increased 1.7 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when profit growth was estimated at 6.5 percent, but has climbed from a low of 0.6 percent reached on Wednesday.That jump occurred despite notable disappointments from IBM Corp (IBM.N) and Google Inc (GOOGL.O). Even with those two lackluster reports, equities still mostly rallied on Thursday.The benchmark S&P index rose 2.7 percent for the holiday-shortened week, helping the index recapture nearly all of the declines suffered in the previous week. The U.S. stock market will be closed for Good Friday. THE CHINA CHALLENGE Investors eyeing the impact of China's troubles on corporate America's bottom line will have a few spots to pick from, including Apple (AAPL.O), Qualcomm (QCOM.O) and Yum Brands(YUM.N).There have been warning signs, with IBM saying this week that its disappointing quarterly revenue was due to worsening sales in the world's second-largest economy and other emerging markets. Earlier in the week, China reported growth came in at its slowest pace in 18 months.Qualcomm's (QCOM.O) revenue for its fiscal year ended September 29, 2013, showed China accounted for nearly half of the company's revenue. Options activity in Qualcomm has been defensive in nature, with investors paying more money to hedge against a fall than a rise in the stock's price. But strategists at Goldman Sachs see this as a buying opportunity, believing the options data shows investors are overly concerned about the quarter.Apple Inc (AAPL.O) also derives 13 percent of its sales from China, according to Thomson Reuters data. The company was once a favorite among momentum investors looking to capitalize on swift price gains, but the stock dropped sharply from all-time highs reached in late 2012. It has been mostly stuck in a range for the last year.StarMine expects Apple to exceed earnings estimates by 1 percent. Notably, Apple has not benefited from a rotation into older tech stocks like Microsoft has. Its shares are down 6.1 percent on the year.BIG MO? UH, NO Along with Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), momentum names such as Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O), Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) and Illumina Inc (ILMN.O) are set to post results. Investors are gearing up for wild swings in those names next week. Trading in Facebook options expiring next Friday suggest investors expect about a 12 percent move in the stock's price by the end of next week. Weekly options are often used in advance of a major event like earnings. Similarly, Netflix options also suggest a 12 percent move.After a spectacular performance in 2013, the selloff in many of these stocks over the past few weeks has contributed to the market's volatility. Whether they affect the broader market may determine how well stocks trade next week.The Nasdaq biotech index .NBI is down nearly 19 percent from its closing high on February 25 while the Global X Social Media Index ETF (SOCL.O) is down 18 percent from its March 6 high. However, both have bounced off drops of more than 20 percent that had sent each into bear market territory.With the nervousness created by the declines in the momentum names, investors have rotated into more defensive names.""What happens at some point is (momentum names) become disassociated from the market at large. People see this happening, they become scared, and they start selling other companies as well,"" said Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco.""It gets to a point where that stops happening and the rest of the market - outside of these crazy names - is not that overvalued.""Some of those names, including Dow components Microsoft (MSFT.O), DuPont (DD.N) and Travelers (TRV.N), are among those identified by Credit Suisse quantitative analysts as potential ""contrarian"" picks as they're among the least loved by Wall Street analysts.All three are also considered undervalued by StarMine's measure of intrinsic value that looks at the long-term growth expectations for these names. Microsoft, for example, is the third-best performer in the Dow this year, having gained 7 percent for the year.(Wall St Week Ahead appears on Thursday because the market will be closed for Good Friday.

198,"  SAN FRANCISCO Advanced Micro Devices Inc's first-quarter results beat expectations, sending its shares higher as the chipmaker tries to replace dwindling sales of PC chips with its processors for game consoles.With the PC industry shrinking for eight straight quarter due to consumers' preferences for tablets and smartphones, AMD is expanding into new markets and aims to get half of its revenue from new, fast-growing businesses by the end of 2015.Chief among those efforts, the Sunnyvale, California, company is supplying processors for Microsoft Corp and Sony Corp's latest game consoles in a bid to make up for its declining PC business.""This is a company that's still in the midst of a very long-term turnaround but you're seeing some successes,"" said Ascendiant Capital analyst Cody Acree. ""None of this is a flip of a switch overnight. It's a plodding quarterly restructuring that really is going to change who AMD is.""On Wednesday, Sony said it sold more than 7 million PlayStation 4 videogame consoles in just over four months to April 6, double the number of the older version, PlayStation 3, sold in about the same time frame after its launch.AMD is also planning this year to launch low-power server chips to compete in data centers against Intel's high-end Xeon processors.

Twenty-one analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters give AMD's stock neutral or negative ratings, while just six are positive. AMD on Thursday reported a net loss of $20 million, or 3 cents per share, for the March quarter, compared with a loss of $146 million, or 19 cents per share a year earlier.But excluding items, AMD earned 2 cents per share, better than the zero cents per share expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

199,"  (Adds analyst comment, background, paragraphs 2-8)SAN FRANCISCO, April 17 Advanced Micro Devices Inc's first-quarter results beat expectations, sending its shares higher as the chipmaker tries to replace dwindling sales of PC chips with its processors for game consoles.With the PC industry shrinking for eight straight quarter due to consumers' preferences for tablets and smartphones, AMD is expanding into new markets and aims to get half of its revenue from new, fast-growing businesses by the end of 2015.Chief among those efforts, the Sunnyvale, California, company is supplying processors for Microsoft Corp and Sony Corp's latest game consoles in a bid to make up for its declining PC business.""This is a company that's still in the midst of a very long-term turnaround but you're seeing some successes,"" said Ascendiant Capital analyst Cody Acree. ""None of this is a flip of a switch overnight. It's a plodding quarterly restructuring that really is going to change who AMD is.""On Wednesday, Sony said it sold more than 7 million PlayStation 4 videogame consoles in just over four months to April 6, double the number of the older version, PlayStation 3, sold in about the same time frame after its launch. AMD is also planning this year to launch low-power server chips to compete in data centers against Intel's high-end Xeon processors.WALL STREET WARY  Chip heavyweight Intel on Tuesday posted quarterly results that reinforced some analysts' expectations that the PC industry's decline may be close to hitting bottom.But Wall Street has been wary of AMD's chances of successfully restructuring into new markets and weathering the PC industry's troubles. Twenty-one analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters give AMD's stock neutral or negative ratings, while just six are positive.AMD on Thursday reported a net loss of $20 million, or 3 cents per share, for the March quarter, compared with a loss of $146 million, or 19 cents per share a year earlier. But excluding items, AMD earned 2 cents per share, better than the zero cents per share expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 28 percent to $1.40 billion in the first quarter.AMD said second-quarter revenue would rise 3 percent, plus or minus 3 percent, from the March quarter. That would be about $1.442 billion.Analysts on average had expected revenue of $1.34 billion in the first quarter and $1.36 billion in the second quarter.Shares of AMD rose 5 percent in extended trade after closing down 1.86 percent at $3.69.

Hero will invest $40 million in the new plant. ** China's online game developer Perfect World Co Ltd  said it joined the consortium offering to buy rival Shanda Games Ltd.

After the deal, L&T was expected to hold a 51 percent stake in the joint venture, with Generali holding 26 percent and the rest with Future Group.** Pinnacle Entertainment Inc shareholder Orange Capital LLC said it had asked the casino operator to consider spinning off its real estate into a separately traded real estate investment trust.

Apple also approved another $30 billion stock-buyback plan, raised its dividend and authorized a seven-for-one stock split.The S&P information technology index rose 1.1 percent and was the best-performing sector of the day.The three major U.S. stock indexes had opened sharply higher, with the Nasdaq initially climbing more than 1 percent before turning negative in the first half-hour of trading. Wall Street bounced off session lows with gains again concentrated in the Nasdaq, but stocks finished the day well off earlier highs. Much of the volatility was driven by comments from Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who said Russia started military drills near the border with Ukraine. Ukrainian forces killed up to five pro-Moscow rebels as they closed in on the separatists' military stronghold in the east.""The market is biased - from all of the good news we've heard on stocks recently - to go higher,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.""However, there are hot spots in the world that keep flaring up like a campfire that won't go out, and the market needs to deal with that.""Caterpillar Inc rose 1.8 percent to $105.28 after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and raised its full-year profit outlook. Limiting the Dow's advance were Verizon Communications Inc  and 3M Co, whose shares fell after the companies' results missed expectations. Verizon dropped 2.4 percent to $46.28, while 3M fell 1 percent to $136.65.The S&P telecom index lost 1.7 percent. The index has dropped 3.8 percent over the past two days, its worst two-session performance since June.The Dow Jones industrial average remained unchanged to close at 16,501.65. The S&P 500 gained 3.22 points or 0.17 percent, to 1,878.61. The Nasdaq Composite added 21.372 points or 0.52 percent, to end at 4,148.338.After the close, Microsoft Corp shares rose 2.4 percent to $40.40 after the world's largest software company posted third-quarter results. Amazon.com Inc advanced 0.5 percent to $338.89 in extended-hours trading after the online retailer reported a 32 percent jump in first-quarter net income and a 23 percent rise in revenue.Facebook Inc reported a 72 percent jump in first-quarter revenue, lifted by its mobile advertising business, after the closing bell on Wednesday. The stock darted between positive and negative territory during the session before closing down 0.8 percent at $60.87.Profits are seen rising 2.9 percent this quarter, down from the 6.5 percent growth rate estimated at the start of the year, but above the low of 0.6 percent seen last week, according to Thomson Reuters data.Zimmer Holdings Inc agreed to buy Biomet Inc  in a deal valued at about $13.35 billion to broaden its portfolio of products that treat bone and joint-related disorders. Zimmer's stock surged 11.5 percent to $101.97.A number of cloud-computing stocks, which have struggled lately but rose last week, opened higher and then quickly sold off. Workday Inc slid 5.3 percent to $72.59 while Salesforce.com fell 1.6 percent to $54.73.Volume was light, with about 6.07 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.59 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,535 to 1,465, while on the Nasdaq, decliners beat advancers by 1,494 to 1,087.

235,"   By Jennifer Saba and Lisa Richwine | NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES  NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES Technology powerhouses like Microsoft Corp and AOL Inc are flexing their muscles as storytellers, parading TV network-style shows before advertisers at an annual digital content showcase in New York next week.With an eye on the big bucks such shows can command, Microsoft will trot out a soccer reality show called ""Every Street United."" Sony Corp's digital network Crackle will serve up Jerry Seinfeld's ""Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee"" and AOL is presenting a documentary drama about five New Yorkers called ""Connected.""This is a big shift from the short Web episodes many tech companies have presented for the last two years at the week-long ""NewFronts"" event - modeled after the annual ""upfronts"" where broadcast and cable TV channels show their wares to Madison Avenue.Yahoo Inc is also looking for longer original programming it can unveil at the showcase, three people familiar with those efforts said on condition on of anonymity because the deals have yet to be finalized.Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer said on Yahoo's earnings call last week that the company plans to make fewer, more focused investments in original content.""We are going to see more original content overall and no doubt everyone is working to package their offerings like TV because they have their eyes on TV dollars,"" said Kris Magel, chief investment officer at Initiative, the media buying division of Interpublic Group of Cos.But TV-scaled ad spending is unlikely to flow to online video commercials that usually run before and during a program, advertisers and analysts said.""Online video just doesn't offer nearly the reach that broadcast does,"" said David Bank, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. AOL has spent about half a billion dollars over the last three years on shorter content. On Wednesday, it also inked a deal with Miramax to stream the independent studio's films on the AOL network for free, but with ads.""Internet companies are bucketed into the snackable short form space,"" Ran Harnevo, president of AOL Video, said. ""But we are seeing the growth in the consumption of content on big screens.""At the NewFronts, which starts on April 28, Microsoft will show longer original shows produced by the company's Xbox Entertainment Studios that exploit the Internet's strengths.""The challenge TV has is it's not very effective in being able to reach a very discrete target audience and measure it and have more interactive components,"" said Scott Ferris, general manager of TV and video advertising for Microsoft. ""We have very engaged, high-quality audiences."" Online series can get messages in front of people who watch little TV, said Peter Naylor, senior vice president of sales for Hulu.com. The website, owned by Walt Disney Co, Comcast Corp and 21st Century Fox, will also pitch shows to advertisers next week.""There is a segment of the video universe that is very, very hard to reach through traditional television,"" Naylor said. ""Online video is a way to reach those light TV viewers.""But because online viewers have to search for content, advertisers may end up paying more to reach them than on TV.The cost per thousand (CPM) for a commercial on a cable network, for example, might be between $10 to $30, depending on the show and the demographic, estimates Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. For online video, a CPM for a comparable demographic could be in the range of $20 to $40. ""There is a lot of aspiration in the NewFronts initiatives,"" said Wieser. ""The reality is traditional TV budgets are intended for content vehicles that are TV-like. (Content) with short term, low budgets with unknown or even known talent is unlikely to capture anything resembling a meaningful TV budget.""Another hurdle is that the money that presenters make from the NewFronts is not tracked by the Interactive Advertising Bureau which hosts the event.Ari Bluman, chief digital investment officer of GroupM, the media buying arm of WPP, notes the TV industry's annual showcase for advertisers exists because they can only buy so many commercial spots on TV, whereas this is not an issue online.However, it may take some time before online shows become mainstream enough to draw big ad dollars.Until then, the NewFronts ""is more of a showcase for what's new and exciting,"" Bluman said.

237,"   By Jim Finkle | BOSTON  BOSTON Microsoft Corp is rushing to fix a bug in its widely used Internet Explorer web browser after a computer security firm disclosed the flaw over the weekend, saying hackers have already exploited it in attacks on some U.S. companies.PCs running Windows XP will not receive any updates fixing that bug when they are released, however, because Microsoft stopped supporting the 13-year-old operating system earlier this month. Security firms estimate that between 15 and 25 percent of the world's PCs still run Windows XP.    .Microsoft disclosed on Saturday its plans to fix the bug in an advisory to its customers posted on its security website, which it said is present in Internet Explorer versions 6 to 11. Those versions dominate desktop browsing, accounting for 55 percent of the PC browser market, according to tech research firm NetMarketShare.Cybersecurity software maker FireEye Inc said that a sophisticated group of hackers have been exploiting the bug in a campaign dubbed “Operation Clandestine Fox.” FireEye, whose Mandiant division helps companies respond to cyber attacks, declined to name specific victims or identify the group of hackers, saying that an investigation into the matter is still active. ""It's a campaign of targeted attacks seemingly against U.S.-based firms, currently tied to defence and financial sectors,"" FireEye spokesman Vitor De Souza said via email. ""It's unclear what the motives of this attack group are, at this point.  It appears to be broad-spectrum intel gathering.""He declined to elaborate, though he said one way to protect against them would be to switch to another browser.Microsoft said in the advisory that the vulnerability could allow a hacker to take complete control of an affected system, then do things such as viewing changing, or deleting data, installing malicious programs, or creating accounts that would give hackers full user rights. FireEye and Microsoft have not provided much information about the security flaw or the approach that hackers could use to figure out how to exploit it, said Aviv Raff, chief technology officer of cybersecurity firm Seculert. Yet other groups of hackers are now racing to learn more about it so they can launch similar attacks before Microsoft prepares a security update, Raff said.""Microsoft should move fast,"" he said. ""This will snowball."" Still, he cautioned that Windows XP users will not benefit from that update since Microsoft has just halted support for that product. The software maker said in a statement to Reuters that it advises Windows XP users to upgrade to one of two most recently versions of its operating system, Windows 7 or 8.

239,"  April 28 Microsoft Corp said it will increase its cloud storage offering for business users by 40-fold as the world's largest software company makes a case for businesses buying an all-in-one product from itself rather than buying technology ""piecemeal"" from multiple sellers.""The era of making isolated, single-solution decisions is rapidly coming to a close,"" wrote John Case, corporate vice president of Microsoft Office Division. Microsoft on Monday raised its OneDrive for Business storage to 1TB per user from 25GB.Microsoft's pitch to be the one-stop destination for companies looking to buy technology runs against efforts by smaller rivals such as Box and Dropbox that offer one or two specialized services.Microsoft did not name its rivals but made a reference to them in the headline of its blog post titled ""Thinking outside the box."" (link.reuters.com/byj88v)Dropbox spokeswoman declined to comment on the Microsoft move. Box Chief Executive Aaron Levie fired back in a blog post, criticizing Microsoft for keeping its storage software ""closed"" and making it difficult for users to move their data between different services. ""By keeping Office 365 users on the closed OneDrive ""island,"" Microsoft is stranding hundreds of millions of users and customers that have chosen Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, and others,"" Levie wrote in response to Microsoft's move. (r.reuters.com/pyj88v)Online document-sharing company Dropbox is a Silicon Valley startup that has proved a hit with consumers and boasts more than 200 million users six years after it was started. It has undergone tremendous growth amid the meteoric rise of cloud, which is expected to continue booming alongside mobile computing. While Dropbox won plaudits for its ease-of-use and gained traction among individual users, Levie focused Box in recent years toward catering to corporate customers who demanded greater levels of administrative control and security.Both companies are expected to go public in the coming months. Cloud services have become increasingly popular among both cash-strapped tech startups and larger companies, which rely on computers owned and operated by the likes of Amazon.com Inc  and Google Inc instead of buying the equipment themselves.Investors are excited about Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella's focus on mobile and cloud computing, designed to take Microsoft beyond its traditional PC-based Windows business.Microsoft, which reported results Thursday, saw Nadella's emphasis on cloud computing help its server software business in the third quarter, while a softer-than-expected decline in PC sales limited damage to the bottom line.

247,"   By Liana B. Baker and Malathi Nayak | LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO  LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO Comcast Corp may soon allow customers using its cloud-connected X1 cable box system to buy games from Electronic Arts Inc through their televisions, according to five sources briefed on the plans.Such a partnership would come as the cable company seeks to protect its turf against a new wave of challengers.After two years of testing, Comcast and EA, are close to reaching an agreement to stream video games such as ""FIFA"" and ""Madden,"" into the living rooms of some of Comcast's more-than 22 million customers across the United States, said the sources, who declined to speak publicly before a deal had been struck.Comcast would make the games available on X1, a video operating system with apps and an interface that is considered the most sophisticated in the cable industry, the sources said. It features Internet applications, viewing recommendations and voice control.If the agreement goes through, it would mark the boldest step yet by a cable company to muscle into the territory of leading video-game console manufacturers such as Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp.Comcast has been beefing its x1 system with new features to stop potential customer defections to rival video streaming systems such as Apple TV and Amazon.com Inc's FireTV, which was launched just last month with a slew of games.Apple TV allows users to stream games from their iOS phones and tablets to TV sets, and developers expect Apple to bring gaming directly to its streaming box. FireTV was released with over 100 free and paid games from the likes of Disney and Electronic Arts. Comcast and EA's aim is to make buying games as easy as ordering a pay-per-view movie, sources said. This could create a new distribution model that circumvents console and video-streaming device makers.EA and Comcast, which is awaiting regulatory approval for its $45 billion proposal to buy Time Warner Cable Inc, declined to comment.The TWC deal, which would make Comcast the country's largest cable provider, highlights Comcast's desire to thwart the fresh challenge from the video and entertainment upstarts.A NEW DAWN  For Electronic Arts, a deal with Comcast could represent an important new revenue opportunity.The video game industry has yet to see a sustained recovery in sagging software sales despite robust hardware sales driven by the November launches of Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4 consoles.In January, Redwood City, California-based EA lowered its 2015 revenue forecast - prompted by the sooner-than-expected drop in sales of games for older consoles after the release of the new devices.Under the agreement now being hashed out with Electronic Arts, Comcast will offer action, sports and casual titles from EA's portfolio, including potential titles such as ""FIFA,"" ""Madden,"" ""Monopoly"" and ""Plants vs. Zombies,"" the people said. The game offerings have not been finalized. Customers will be able to turn their tablets into controllers to play the games. Revenue share terms and the exact release date have not been decided.Comcast has been bulking up the capabilities of its X1 service, which can store content on the cloud, and experimenting with new ways to reach viewers.Last fall, it started selling movies for download and streaming through its set-top boxes and XFINITY TV website, which created a new path for Hollywood studios to generate revenue from films after their theater run ends.While Comcast added video subscribers for the past two quarters, after years of losses, it is facing increasing competition for viewership, both online and through streaming boxes. The Xbox and PlayStation, for instance, are now marketed as living room entertainment hubs that offer more than just games.Microsoft and Sony have added media features to their consoles over the past two years like original programming, online video and TV apps -- including Comcast's XFINITY on-demand service. But cable companies so far have not been able to load their set-top boxes with the technology to support gaming.Comcast will focus on casual and family games at first and consider offering other first-person shooter and action games later based on user preferences, the sources told Reuters.(Editing by Edwin Chan and Alden Bentley)",2014-05-02,MSFT,"Fri May 2, 2014 | 4:11pm EDT",Exclusive - Comcast nears deal to stream EA games to TVs: sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-comcast-gaming-exclusive-idUSBREA410V920140502?type=companyNews,0.9944,0.018,0.879,0.102
248,"  SEATTLE Bill Gates, the former chief executive and chairman of Microsoft Corp, will have no direct ownership in the company he co-founded by mid-2018 if he keeps up his recent share sales.Gates, who started the company that revolutionized personal computing with school-friend Paul Allen in 1975, has sold 20 million shares each quarter for most of the last dozen years under a pre-set trading plan.Assuming no change to that pattern, Gates will have no direct ownership of Microsoft shares at all four years from now.With his latest sales this week, Gates was finally eclipsed as Microsoft's largest individual shareholder by the company's other former CEO, Steve Ballmer, who retired in February, but has held on to his stock. According to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, Gates now owns just over 330 million Microsoft shares after the sales this week. Ballmer owns just over 333 million, according to Thomson Reuters data.That gives both men around 4 percent each of the total outstanding shares, making them by far the biggest individual shareholders. Fund firms The Vanguard Group, State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock have slightly bigger stakes, according to Thomson Reuters data. Spokesmen for Gates and Microsoft declined comment.Gates owned 49 percent of Microsoft at its initial public offering in 1986, which made him an instant multi-millionaire.

250,"  * Nintendo planning console for lower-income gamers* Will try different strategy to Microsoft for China -CEO   (Adds details on company strategy, CEO quotes, background on China ban, shares)By Sophie Knight and Reiji MuraiTOKYO, May 8 Nintendo Co Ltd plans to introduce a new kind of games console and software for emerging markets as early as next year, to capitalise on higher entertainment budgets amidst a growing middle class, its chief executive told Reuters on Thursday.Satoru Iwata said Nintendo would develop hardware and games oriented towards consumers with lower incomes and less gaming experience than those in developed countries.Nintendo is searching for new business opportunities as it buckles down and seeks to stem losses on its latest home game console, the Wii U, whose flop has contrasted with blockbuster sales for rival Sony Corp's Playstation 4. Satoru said there were no plans to launch existing hardware such as the Wii U or 3DS in emerging markets, including China.""It would be difficult to enter those markets if we didn't create something new... For the mass market you need to provide something that most of the middle class can afford,"" he said in an interview following an analyst briefing on Thursday.Iwata declined to elaborate on the design and specification of such a new device and did not specify the countries where it would be sold, saying only that ""emerging markets"" referred to those whose gaming potential had not yet been cracked. In China, Iwata said Nintendo would try a different tack to Microsoft Corp. The U.S. rival last month said it would begin selling its Xbox One console through a Chinese partner from September in Shanghai's free trade zone, after the government lifted a ban on the sale of foreign consoles there.""We think the Chinese market has a lot of potential, but I don't think the lifting of the ban has solved all of the difficulties in entering it. We need to study it more,"" he said, adding that Nintendo would adjust its pricing to fit consumers in emerging nations. ""For us, Microsoft's approach wouldn't work.""Iwata also said Nintendo will release high-tech figurines of some of its most popular characters in time for Christmas this year. The company hopes the models, which will be able to send and receive data from games, will also stimulate software sales.But the chief executive said he could not give any more details on a new ""non-wearable"" platform announced in January that will be oriented towards improving customers' quality of life and encouraging them to stick to healthy pursuits.Nintendo released its full-year earnings On Wednesday, booking its third year in the red after disappointing sales of its Wii U home games console. It has pinned a return to profit this year on new game titles spurring higher sales of the hardware.Shares of Nintendo closed 0.7 percent lower on Thursday, compared with a 0.9 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei index .

251,"  (Recasts first paragraph with entertainment apps, adds executive quote, details throughout)By Malathi NayakSAN FRANCISCO May 13 Microsoft Corp  will take $100 off the price of its Xbox One gaming console and let users view popular entertainment apps such as Netflix and ESPN without a $60-plus ""Live"" subscription, hoping to spur sales against rival devices like Sony's Playstation 4 and Amazon's Fire TV.The moves mark another reversal for the software giant on the Xbox One, which is lagging Sony's PS4 in sales and faces  competition from existing consoles, streaming boxes such as Apple TV and Amazon's new $99 gaming-and-entertainment device. Microsoft has backtracked several times in marketing its gaming console. It dropped a requirement that Xbox One users maintain a constant Internet connection before the console went on sale. And it decided to allow support for used games after an outpouring of outrage from gamers last year.On Tuesday, the company said it will now sell the Xbox One for $399, or $499 with a ""Kinect"" motion sensor, starting June 9. Executives had previously talked about the Kinect, which tracks hand and body movements, as integral to the device's experience. ""That's going to appeal to our fans on Xbox 360 who have been excited to try Xbox One but, because of affordability options, haven't had the opportunity,"" Yusuf Mehdi, Xbox vice president for strategy and marketing, said in an interview. ""So we think that's going to grow the market.""As with Sony's PlayStation and Nintendo's  Wii U consoles, Xbox One and Xbox 360 users will not be charged by Microsoft to run entertainment apps starting June. Previously, only those who subscribed to its Xbox LIVE game and entertainment streaming service, which starts at $60 a year, could stream content from popular apps such as Netflix, Hulu and HBO Go.Sales of the Xbox one console have lagged Sony's PS4 since their holiday launches. Microsoft Corp said last month it has sold over 5 million Xbox One video game consoles as of April 17.The console went on sale on Nov. 22 in 13 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, a week before Sony's PS4 which sold more than 7 million units as of April 6.

253,"   By Bill Rigby | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Satya Nadella has enjoyed a fairly smooth ride in his first 100 days as Microsoft Corp chief executive, but he risks hitting a rough patch next week when he unveils the latest models of the tepidly received Surface tablet.Investors have lapped up Nadella's ""mobile first, cloud first"" strategy to recast the venerable software maker as a ""devices and services"" company, sending its shares up 9 percent since he took the helm.So far he has stressed the services side of the business, making the momentous move to put Microsoft's Office suite on Apple Inc's iPad. This was popular with Wall Street and more importantly with consumers, who performed 27 million downloads in a matter of weeks.But Microsoft is expected to unveil the third generation of its Surface devices at an event on Tuesday, laying hints that it will also introduce a smaller tablet, to address the fast-selling lower end of the market dominated by Apple's iPad mini, Amazon.com Inc's Kindle Fire, Google Inc's Nexus and Samsung's Galaxy range. The devices side of the strategy has been a challenge. Microsoft's Surface, launched in October 2012, has about 2 percent of the market and has not made a dent on Apple's iPad. That fits with Microsoft's 3 percent global share in smartphones.Given that tiny market, some investors believe Microsoft should not waste time and money on the low-margin hardware business. ValueAct Capital, which led the shareholder revolt last year which culminated in previous CEO Steve Ballmer's retirement, has lobbied against Microsoft's hardware effort, including its costly acquisition of Nokia's handset business. ""Nadella is off to a golden start as CEO, although turning around the tablet and mobile business over the next 12 to 18 months remain his two key Herculean tasks,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""If the turbulence gets too rough on the tablet and/or mobile segment, we can potentially see some strategic changes on the horizon around the hardware business.""Despite unspectacular sales, there are signs that Microsoft's Surface Pro 2, which runs the full Windows operating system, is starting to attract Microsoft's core business customers. ""There's certainly tons of interest in the Surface Pro as an Ultrabook (lightweight laptop) replacement that has tablet capabilities,"" said J.P. Gownder, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. ""It is the No. 1 model I get asked about, it's going to have a lot of eyes on it.""Even if the Surface never dominates the market, Gownder thinks Nadella and Microsoft are right to persevere with hardware, if only as a way of showing other device makers how best to make use of Windows.""Microsoft would be nuts not to have devices in the mix. The danger is in not exploring,"" said Gownder. The Surface ""is an important product to basically show what their overall vision is for Windows, and also to offer businesses and consumers another choice.""(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by David Gregorio)",2014-05-15,MSFT,"Thu May 15, 2014 | 4:49pm EDT",Now the hard part: Microsoft CEO touts new Surface tablets,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-microsoft-surface-idUSBREA4E0YL20140515?type=companyNews,0.9532,0.048,0.869,0.083
254,"  * Google offers to display rival links prominently* Concession would be valid in Europe for five yearsBy Foo Yun CheeST GALLEN, Switzerland, May 15 EU regulators plan to issue a final decision on their competition probe into Google after the summer break, the EU's antitrust chief said, after rivals such as Microsoft complained about how Google displays Internet search results. The world's top Internet search engine reached a deal with EU antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia in February by agreeing to display rivals' links more prominently, hoping to end a three-year-old case that could have led to a fine of up to $5 billion (3.6 billion euros).More than a dozen companies, including Microsoft, British price comparison site Foundem and German online mapping company Hotmaps, have accused Google of squeezing them out of the market by demoting them in Internet search results. Rivals say Google's concessions do not go far enough and will only entrench its dominance of Internet searches. And sources close to the matter have told Reuters that a third of members on the European Commission also opposed the deal, underlining the political sensitivity of the matter. European Competition Commissioner Almunia said on Thursday he was listening to the various views but would not go back on the deal.""I want this to be decided before the end of this Commission. I want to conclude ... weeks after the summer break,"" he told a St Gallen competition conference. The Commission effectively closes for August.The Google deal would be valid for five years in Europe, where the company has a market share of more than 70 percent.

GameStop forecast second-quarter earnings of 12-20 cents per share. Analysts are expecting earnings of 17 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.To combat falling video game software sales, GameStop has stepped up sales of used games and hardware in recent years, as well as expanding its range of digital and mobile products to include iOS and Android devices in some stores.The Grapevine, Texas-based company said revenue in its hardware business rose 81 percent to $438 million for the quarter ended May 3. Revenue from its mobile and consumer electronics business doubled to $102.2 million.Sales of new game software fell 20.4 percent, hurt by fewer launches of popular video game titles. The results reflect a wider trend.

258,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Abhirup Roy  Jack Fearing, creative director at advertising agency MossWarner, was driving to a meeting a couple of years ago when he got an urgent call from a client, halfway across the world, asking for a last-minute edit of a video.""We pulled over to a Starbucks, uploaded the videos to Onehub and then we were able to review it with the client,"" Fearing said. A crisis was averted.Onehub is a file-sharing company, one of a wave of startups that allow users to share and modify huge data files at a stroke. At such short notice, Fearing and his client would not have been able to edit the video by email.Originally a way for friends to share music and movies, online file-sharing is now in demand from big businesses seeking to swap costly data centers for secure storage in the cloud.Osterman Research, a Washington-based market research company focusing on IT, expects the global file synchronization and sharing market to double to about $80 billion by 2017.Eighty percent to 90 percent of that revenue will come from businesses, the company's president, Michael Osterman, said.This promise of steady revenue from big business has led file-sharing companies to make a play for the funds needed to corner as much of the market as possible before the likes of Google Inc (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) take a hold.Cue a wave of initial public offerings (IPOs) and buyouts. But as competition intensifies and valuations soar, startups must get better at turning demand into revenue if they are to convince investors of their staying power.Box Inc is aiming to be one of the first to market. The Los Altos, California-based company, which says its online file-sharing services are used by more than 25 million people and 225,000 companies, filed for an IPO in March.""Box is offering the right solution at the right time,"" said Josh Stein, a partner at Draper Fisher Jurvetson, the venture capital firm that led Box's first funding round in 2006 and owns about 25.5 percent of the company.A source familiar with the company, who declined to be identified, said Box was valued at $2 billion following its most recent funding round in December.Smaller peers Egnyte, which has Swedish furniture retailer IKEA among its more than 30,000 customers, and Accellion Inc, which serves Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), have also announced plans to go public next year. ""They are starting to reach that level of maturity where it begins to make sense,"" said Jeffrey Mann, analyst at IT research and advisory firm Gartner.TIME TO PAY UP More than 780 million users will be sharing files in 2017, compared with slightly more than 590 million in 2012, according to Osterman. (link.reuters.com/qep78v)And when it comes to online file sharing, the biggest player is Dropbox. A new funding round this year, involving BlackRock Inc (BLK.N) and other investors, valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $10 billion.Chief Executive Drew Houston said in September that Dropbox would go public ""at some point"" but that there was no immediate need for an IPO. The company declined further comment.Dropbox has 275 million users worldwide, according to its website. Yet as recently as last year, according to Forbes, just over 1 percent of users were paying for the company's services, with the majority availing a free 2-gigabyte plan. The shift toward business use is changing the way Dropbox and its rivals operate. Products such as 'Dropbox for Business', unveiled in November to allow users to maintain both personal and corporate accounts, are targeting paying business customers.More than before, investors are demanding to see revenue. This is leading to increased competition, particularly as the giants of the industry take notice of business users' readiness to pay for file-sharing products.In March, Google slashed prices for 100 gigabytes of storage space on Google Drive to $1.99 per month from $4.99 — below the $9.99 charged by Dropbox and the $5 charged by Box.""The price wars have begun,"" said Paul Hughes, analyst at market research firm IDC. ""It is going to drive smaller players out of the market, unless they can differentiate.""BEING DIFFERENT Smaller companies unable to compete on price could move into the high-end file security business as a way to grow and sustain revenue, Osterman said. Since the revelation by former contractor Edward Snowden of the U.S. National Security Agency's bulk collection of telephone and Internet records, data security has become a big selling point for file-sharing companies seeking business clients.Hightail, the closest rival to Dropbox in terms of registered users, has recently invested in features to protect data, destroy it after use and track the identity of those who access files uploaded by its 40 million-plus registered users.""The Edward Snowden revelation has made everyone — whether you are a consumer, whether you are a CEO — become more aware of the desire to understand how your data is being accessed,"" said Hightail Chief Executive Brad Garlinghouse.The risk for smaller companies, said Osterman, is that file-sharing and synchronization could end up becoming features within larger products.Microsoft's OneDrive, for example, is available as part of its Office 365 software suite as well as a standalone product.Since Box filed for an IPO on March 24 — the company has not set a date for the listing — cloud-based software companies Workday Inc (WDAY.N) and Veeva Systems Inc (VEEV.N) have lost about a fifth and a quarter of their market values respectively.There may be other routes to riches for the founders of file-sharing startups.""Being acquired by a larger player is certainly one interesting outcome that we are open to,"" said Charles Mount, CEO of Onehub, the Seattle-based company that came to Jack Fearing's rescue.But IDC's Hughes said some private file-sharing companies were quickly becoming expensive for potential suitors such as Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) or Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).""The valuations, I think, are crazy — tenfold earnings in some cases,"" he said.(Editing by Robin Paxton)",2014-05-22,MSFT,"Thu May 22, 2014 | 2:40pm EDT","Business demand pushes file-sharing startups toward IPOs, buyouts",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-filesharing-ipo-idUSBREA4L10T20140522?type=companyNews,0.9762,0.046,0.877,0.077
259,"  * Sony says no plans regarding development of operations, details to come* Shanghai Oriental Pearl says one JV for hardware, one for software* Comes after Microsoft sets Xbox One China launch for September   (Adds capital, ownership of JVs, Sony comment, context)By Paul CarstenBEIJING, May 26 Japan's Sony Corp and China's Shanghai Oriental Pearl Group Co Ltd will set up two joint ventures to make and market Sony's PlayStation games console in China, Shanghai Oriental Pearl said in a stock exchange filing on Monday.One joint venture will be responsible for the console's hardware, while the other will be focused on software, the company said in the filing to the Shanghai Stock Exchange. The joint ventures, which will be in Shanghai's free trade zone, will be set up by a subsidiary of Shanghai Oriental Pearl and by Sony's China arm.But China is likely to be a difficult market for games consoles, which were banned from 2000 until last January. Piracy and smuggling of consoles is rife, and the Chinese gaming market is very different to traditional console markets like Japan, Europe and the U.S. as Chinese gamers predominantly play PC and mobile games.Chinese games developers and publishers have also adopted a ""free to play"" model where games are free and they make money by selling in-game upgrades like extra lives and special weapons. Games consoles traditionally make their money from the sale of the console and games themselves. Sony and Shanghai Oriental Pearl are setting up the joint ventures in response to the suspension of the ban on game consoles within Shanghai's free trade zone, a Sony Computer Entertainment Inc spokesman told Reuters.Nothing has been decided regarding the development of operations, and details will be announced later, the spokesman said.Sony Computer Entertainment Inc is the Sony unit responsible for the PlayStation. One of the joint ventures will have registered capital of 10 million yuan ($1.60 million) and will be 51 percent owned by Shanghai Oriental Pearl Culture Development Co and 49 percent owned by Sony (China), Shanghai Oriental Pearl said in the filing.The other will have registered capital of 43.8 million yuan and will be 30 percent owned by Shanghai Oriental Pearl Culture Development Co and 70 percent owned by Sony (China).Sony's move comes one month after Microsoft Corp  and its joint-venture partner BesTV New Media Co Ltd  announced they would launch Microsoft's flagship Xbox One games console in China in September.Earlier in April, Shanghai's government said console makers such as Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo Co will be able to manufacture and sell consoles in China through ""foreign-invested enterprises"" in Shanghai's free trade zone, after temporarily lifting the ban on consoles in January.China had banned game consoles in 2000, citing their negative effect on the mental health of its youth.

May 28 Twelve-year-old Nathan Manaker had not been hopeful about his chances when the Scripps National Spelling Bee got under way on Wednesday, and he turned out to be right.Manaker, a seventh-grader from Orono, Maine, was among the first spellers ejected as winnowing of the 281 contestants, ages 8 to 15, began ahead of the finals on Thursday night.Spellers from across the United States and a raft of foreign countries looked to the ceiling for help, traced words on their hands and forearms and breathed deeply when faced with such challenges as ""kuchen,"" ""braggadocio,"" and ""witloof.""One of the first round of spellers, Manaker advanced to the microphone at a hotel ballroom outside Washington.

He guessed wrong, spelling the word ""peridyme."" The fourth speller out, Manaker left the stage with his head down to be greeted by his mother, Jessica.A first-time contestant with an interest in theater, Manaker said he had not come to win: ""I'm kind of glad I got out because I really can't sit still that long, and I really need a bathroom break.""

When Mitchell Robson, 12, of Marblehead, Massachusetts, was given ""poignant,"" he asked Bailly, ""Could I have that in a funny sentence?"" before getting it right. Contestants, who emerged from an original pool estimated at more than 11 million students, went through a computerized test of spelling and vocabulary on Tuesday. A computerized test for semifinalists will follow the preliminary rounds on Wednesday.The spelling bee finals on Thursday will be broadcast on ESPN.

269,"   By Ronald Grover  and Eric Kelsey  Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer's record $2 billion deal to buy the Los Angeles Clippers shows that star forward Blake Griffin and his monster slam dunks aren't the only things that defy gravity. When the National Basketball Association first hit Clippers owner Donald Sterling with a lifetime ban, investment bankers estimated the price of his team at around $1 billion. Instead, three groups, teaming with billionaires and celebrities, bid up the price to a record for a NBA team, double the initial estimate.The eye-popping sale price has likely boosted the stock of other teams around the NBA, said sports consultant Ed Desser, a former top NBA TV executive, and could have a ripple effect.""Sports franchises are one-of-a-kind trophy properties,""  Desser said. ""Every owner saw what just happened.""As evidence, Rich Tullo, an analyst at Albert Fried & Company LLC, points to Madison Square Garden Co, which owns the NBA's New York Knicks and the National Hockey League's New York Rangers. About 738,000 shares of MSG changed hands within the first 55 minutes of trading the morning after the Clipper deal, surpassing the 10-day average of about 618,000 shares. At mid-afternoon the stock was up 3.2 percent at $54.77.Tullo, who has an ""overweight"" recommendation on the stock, figures much of that rise reflects a new valuation for the Knicks. (That said, the Rangers may have helped the stock: On the evening the Clippers deal was announced, the New Yorkers clinched a trip to the NHL's Stanley Cup finals.) LIKE FINE ART Billionaires like Ballmer are willing to bid up the price of sports franchises because the teams have become trophy assets, much like fancy art and yachts, said Desser, the sports consultant.  Demand is outstripping supply. The major sports leagues have granted few new expansion franchises recently, he says, creating bidding wars among deep-pocketed buyers for those that come on the market.Fortune estimated in April that there are a record 1,645 billionaires worldwide, with an aggregate net worth of $6.4 trillion. The magazine said 492 of them live in the United States. ""There just aren't enough teams out there for the billionaires who want them,"" Desser said. David Geffen, the entertainment mogul who led a competing group of Clipper bidders that included TV icon Oprah Winfrey, had his eye on buying the Clippers for years. But it was Ballmer, who left Microsoft in February with a multibillion-dollar exit package, who was willing to ante up the most. Ballmer is not only very rich, he's also fanatical about basketball, according to those who know him. Until recently he played pickup games with Microsoft staffers at a gym near the software giant's Redmond, Washington, campus.  In 2012, more than a dozen groups made initial bids for Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers, which was expected to go for $1.5 billion. The winners, a group headed by executives of the Guggenheim Partners money management firm and including basketball great Magic Johnson, paid $2.15 billion, still the record for a sports franchise.TV RIGHTS One of the reasons Ballmer's deal is so breathtaking is that the Knicks are worth about 50 percent more than the Clippers franchise, Tullo said. That's because the New York team's parent company owns its own cable TV network and Madison Square Garden, the arena in which the team plays. The Knicks, like the Clippers and Dodgers in LA, play in a major TV market that allows them to charge hefty ticket prices and get massive TV contracts.  But big-ticket sports purchases extend to smaller markets as well. Until Ballmer's bid for the Clippers, the NBA record was set in April when billionaire investment-firm executives Wes Edens and Marc Lasry paid $550 million for the Milwaukee Bucks, a small market team with the league's worst record.A team's win-loss lost record is only one consideration for a new owner, said sports consultant Chris Bevilacqua, who started the college sports cable channel CSTV and now advises teams on TV contracts.Sports teams, he said, are under-exploited assets, whose high profile in the United States make them popular overseas. Digital distribution offers added revenues, he said.Even so, Ballmer's massive investment is not likely to pay off anytime soon, say investment bankers who worked on the deal. It's unclear whether he can extract a huge new TV contract for the Clippers, who currently get about $25 million a year from a deal with Prime Ticket, a channel owned by Twenty-First Century Fox, that expires after the 2016 season. The Lakers signed a $3 billion, 20-year deal with Time Warner Cable Inc in 2011, and the cable operator also has a $7 billion, 25-year agreement with the Dodgers. But TWC, which shows the games on regional sports channels, has had trouble enticing other cable and satellite operators to carry the channels because of the fees it charges.Ultimately that may not matter much to Ballmer, who like many billionaires is motivated most by the love of the game,  Desser, the former NBA TV executive, figures.""It's awfully good to be an owner who's got enough money to not worry about making his team's cash calls,"" he said.

274,"  (The author is a Reuters contributor. The opinions expressed are his own.)By Lewis BrahamPittsburgh, June 3 One morning in April, my Yahoo email account was disabled for no apparent reason.As a freelancer, my email account is my professional lifeline. But it wasn't just the security threat or potential for lost business that upset me. It was my personal history: jokes my brother sent me weeks before he died, emails from friends I hadn't seen in years, love letters from my wife.In the seven weeks since my account was shut, I've spent about 12 hours on hold with Yahoo customer service and corresponded with the company at least 15 times.Meanwhile, fearing a security breach, I changed the passwords to all of my online accounts, ordered new credit cards and had the credit reporting agency Equifax put my status on ""fraud alert."" I emailed contacts not to use or trust my old email address which may have been hacked.And I still don't have my email account back.Since then, I've learned it wasn't a security threat that was the problem. It was a question of ownership. And, if your email account is terminated, don't expect to revive it.After two weeks of calling and emailing Yahoo's customer service, I received a message on my Gmail account from Yahoo Customer Care informing me that my account had been disabled for violating Yahoo's Terms of Service (here).TERMINATED  The email did not specify what terms I had violated, merely that ""Yahoo, in its sole discretion, may terminate your password, account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service, and remove and discard any content within the Service, for any reason.""I tried to figure out how I might have breached Yahoo's terms of service. The best I could come up with was that I had 'flamed' people (slang for insulting people online or expressing angry opinions) in message boards under Yahoo articles, after they'd flamed me.But the truth was I didn't know. Yahoo's terms are flexible in defining violations, with its terms of service including agreement by the user not to send, share or post content that's ""unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, tortious, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, libelous, invasive of another's privacy, hateful, or racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable.""""I think Yahoo left out the part where they say, 'Or if we just don't like it,'"" jokes Eric Goldman, law professor at Santa Clara University, who has written on email ownership rights. ""Unfortunately, federal law provides email service providers unfettered discretion to terminate accounts for whatever reason they want.""An email account over the Internet is a cloud-based service, Goldman notes. ""A cloud service can lock off your assets,"" he adds. ""They may still be your assets from a matter of legal ownership, but if you have no access to them, who cares?""Microsoft and Google use language similar to Yahoo's for their terms of service, although Google says users own their data and access to it is important. ""If we discontinue a Service, where reasonably possible, we will give you reasonable advance notice and a chance to get information out of that Service,"" Google says.Just how many accounts are terminated annually is unknown - service providers don't release that data.REACTIVATING THE ACCOUNT Since Yahoo would not reactivate my account, I asked the company for permission to download my old emails and contacts. A customer service rep promised a response, which never came. According to Yahoo spokesperson Erin Fors, Yahoo users must agree to comply with the company's terms of service when they create their Yahoo account.""We have clear rules in our Terms, and in related guidelines documents, that set out what is and is not acceptable behavior on Yahoo services,"" Fors said via email.Weeks after this nightmare descended on my inbox, I found a warning the company sent to an AOL account that I glance at infrequently. Why didn't Yahoo just send the warning to my Yahoo address? I will never know.ALTERNATIVES What's your alternative to free service providers like Yahoo, Google and Microsoft? Several paid email service providers say that they allow customers to access old emails after disabling a user's account.""We never shut down access to e-mail data,"" says George Breahna, chief executive officer of PolarisMail. ""If we do decide to terminate the account, the customer will obviously be allowed to get back all their data.""PolarisMail charges $1 a month for a basic account with 25 GB of storage and $2 a month for extra features. GoDaddy charges $3.99 a month for 5 GB of storage. Rackspace charges $2 a month for 25 GB of storage.In the end, it's the correspondence with my wife I will miss the most. All the little notes we had exchanged through the course of our entire relationship; the corny but endearing declarations, the extravagant anniversary plans, the mundane grocery lists.Losing this account has taken the diary of my life with her and torched it.

275,"  BEIJING Chinese state media lashed out at Google Inc GOOGL.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O and other U.S. technology companies on Wednesday, calling on Beijing ""to punish severely the pawns"" of the U.S. government for monitoring China and stealing secrets.U.S. companies such as Yahoo Inc YHOO.O, Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Facebook Inc FB.O threaten the cyber-security of China and its Internet users, said the People's Daily on its microblog, in comments echoed on the front page of the English-language China Daily.It is not clear what sparked this latest round of vitriol, nor what information the U.S. firms are alleged to have stolen. But Chinese media have repeatedly attacked American tech companies for aiding the U.S. government's cyber espionage since U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden revealed widespread spying programs including PRISM.Under PRISM, the NSA seized data from companies such as Google and Apple, according to revelations made by Snowden a year ago.Chinese state-owned firms have since begun dispensing with the services of U.S. companies such as IBM Corp IBM.N, Oracle Corp ORCL.N and Cisco in favor of domestic technology. As a result, Snowden's revelations may cost U.S. companies billions of dollars, analysts say.""U.S. companies including Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc. are all coordinating with the PRISM program to monitor China,"" the People's Daily said on its official microblog.""To resist the naked Internet hegemony, we will draw up international regulations, and strengthen technology safeguards, but we will also severely punish the pawns of the villain. The priority is strengthening penalties and punishments, and for anyone who steals our information, even though they are far away, we shall punish them!"" it said.Google has already had problems in China this week. On Monday, a China censorship watchdog said Google services were being disrupted ahead of Wednesday's 25th anniversary of the 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators around Beijing's Tiananmen Square. (Full Story) ""We cannot say this more clearly - the (U.S.) government does not have access to Google servers - not directly, or via a back door, or a so-called drop box,"" said Google Chief Legal Officer David Drummond in an emailed statement on Wednesday. ""We provide user data to governments only in accordance with the law.""Microsoft declined to provide immediate comment. Facebook, Yahoo and Cisco were not immediately available when Reuters sought comment. All of them have previously denied participating in sweeping surveillance efforts.Apple on Wednesday referred to its previous statements on the matter.""Much of what has been said isn't true. There is no back door. The government doesn't have access to our servers. They would have to cart us out in a box for that,"" Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said in an April interview with ABC Television. ROCKY TIME Facebook is currently blocked by Chinese censors but said last month it may open a sales office in China to provide more support to local advertisers who use the website to reach customers overseas. (Full Story)In December, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, Yahoo and other Internet companies issued an open letter to U.S. President Barack Obama and Congress to reform and introduce restrictions on surveillance activities. (Full Story) Even so, U.S. tech companies have had a rocky time in China since the NSA revelations. Just last month, central government offices were banned from installing Windows 8, Microsoft's latest operating system, on new computers. (Full Story)But the U.S. has responded with its own measures. In May, the U.S. Department of Justice charged five Chinese military officers with hacking U.S. companies to steal trade secrets.The indictment sparked outrage in China and added urgency to Beijing's efforts to promote the development of local information technology (IT) companies.Chinese media called the United States ""a high-level hooligan"" and officials accused Washington of applying ""double standards"" on issues of cyber spying.After the charges were announced, China said it will investigate providers of important IT products and services to protect ""national security"" and ""economic and social development.""

278,"   By Lisa Maria Garza | SAN ANTONIO Texas  SAN ANTONIO Texas National Basketball Association Commissioner Adam Silver said on Sunday a single obstacle blocked completion of the $2-billion sale of the Los Angeles Clippers - a lawsuit brought by embattled owner Donald Sterling against the league.Sterling, 80, sued the NBA and Silver on May 30 seeking at least $1 billion in damages just as the league tentatively approved a deal by his estranged wife, co-owner of the franchise, to sell the club to former Microsoft Corp chief executive Steve Ballmer.Days later, Sterling's lawyer, Max Blecher, said his client had agreed to the sale and would withdraw the lawsuit. But Silver said the case was still pending and was holding up a final disposition of the deal.""We're almost there. There is this last piece, and that is the lawsuit that Donald brought against the League and me personally,"" Silver told reporters before Game 2 of the NBA Finals in San Antonio. In an email, Blecher told Reuters that no decision had been made on the lawsuit and all options were under consideration.At a news conference before Game 2 of the NBA Finals, Silver said there was ""absolutely no possibility"" of rescinding the lifetime ban or the $2.5-million fine he handed down to Sterling following his racist remarks.Sterling was banned for life from the NBA in April after a tape recording of disparaging remarks he made about black people was leaked to the celebrity news website TMZ.com, igniting an uproar among fans, players and commercial sponsors of his team. The NBA commissioner also fined Sterling $2.5 million, the league's maximum monetary penalty, and urged its 29 other team owners to take the unprecedented step of forcing Sterling to sell the Clippers, which he bought in 1981 for $12.5 million.After first threatening not to relinquish the team without a fight, Sterling ceded a controlling interest in the team to his wife, Shelly, who was already a 50-percent co-owner through a family trust, for the purpose of negotiating a sale. After she struck a deal to sell the Clippers to Ballmer for a league record $2 billion, Sterling sued the NBA, seeking, among other things, to recoup the capital gains taxes he would have to pay, though Blecher later said the lawsuit would be dropped.""I have absolute confidence it will be resolved because as part of the sale agreement with Shelly Sterling, she agreed to indemnify the league against a lawsuit by her husband. So in essence, Donald is suing himself and he knows that. While I understand he is frustrated, I think it's over,"" Silver said.

281,"  WASHINGTON Handsets made by ZTE Corp and Nokia, now owned by Microsoft Corp, do not violate InterDigital Inc's patents for wireless phones, a U.S. International Trade Commission judge said in a preliminary ruling released on Friday.The full commission is expected to issue a final ruling in October.InterDigital shares plunged more than 10 percent on the ruling, and but they recovered somewhat and were down about 7.3 percent in late-afternoon U.S. trading.      InterDigital said in a statement that it would appeal to the full commission, and potentially to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.""Today's decision by the administrative law judge is unfortunate, and does not align with the validation of our portfolio and licensing practices that is reflected in our numerous agreements with major wireless companies worldwide,"" the company said in a statement. Initially, Wilmington, Delaware-based InterDigital had also sued Samsung Electronics and Huawei for infringement but these two companies opted to settle. It had accused the companies of infringing on seven patents when the case was filed in 2013, but four dropped out in the course of litigation. Originally, InterDigital had sued Nokia, which sold its handset business to Microsoft during the course of litigation. That deal closed in April 2014.Microsoft had no comment on the case, while ZTE did not respond to requests for comment. The ITC is a popular venue for patent lawsuits because it can ban products that infringe on patents from being imported into the United States more easily than district courts can.The case at the International Trade Commission is InterDigital Communications v.

K. and Sagarika JaisinghaniJune 13 Travel website owner Priceline Group Inc  will buy restaurant reservation website operator OpenTable Inc for $2.6 billion, aiming to broaden its services outside the increasingly competitive online travel industry.Priceline's offer of $103 per share for the owner of OpenTable.com represents a premium of 46 percent to OpenTable's Thursday close.OpenTable's shares inched past the offer price to trade as high as $104.19 on the Nasdaq, suggesting that some investors expect a higher bid. Priceline's shares were down 1.6 percent at $1,205.50.Priceline, whose competitors include Expedia Inc  and Orbitz Worldwide Inc, has a record of buying smaller companies and transforming them into large, successful businesses.With little room to expand, online travel companies are looking outside the industry to boost revenue and drive more customers to their websites by offering more of a one-stop shop for travelers by offering services at their destination.TripAdvisor Inc, for example, bought French online restaurant booking platform Lafourchette last month to enter the restaurant-booking industry. Friday's deal gives the travel site operator access to OpenTable's agreements with over 23,000 U.S. restaurants.OpenTable has been trying to expand its international business as it faces increased competition from Yelp Inc  and a slew of startups focused on local services.""Priceline could further strengthen OpenTable's business, especially in Europe, where Priceline is the market leader, as a result of its significant online user traffic and its organizational infrastructure,"" Citi Investment Research analyst Mark May wrote in a research note.Priceline bought Kayak.com last year and has built it into one of the biggest travel websites outside the United States. It has also ramped up U.S. advertising for Booking.com, which it bought in 2005, giving stiff competition to Expedia. As of Thursday, OpenTable's shares were trading at about 33.5 times 12-month estimated forward earnings, far below the 498.7 times of Yelp, its closest competitor, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine.""I think (the takeover) creates urgency for larger players to acquire the leading local platforms,"" Telsey Advisory Group analyst James Cakmak told Reuters, mentioning Yahoo Inc , Google Inc and Microsoft Corp as potential buyers in the sector.OpenTable posted its first quarterly loss in five years for the period ended March 31 as it spent more on marketing to stem the slowdown in the number of restaurants signing up for its services.The number of North American restaurants using OpenTable's platform rose 19 percent, but growth was slower than in the previous two quarters.OpenTable, which gets $1.00 from a restaurant if a diner reserves a table through its website or app, will continue to operate as an independent business led by its current management, Priceline said.Yelp's shares were up 13 percent at $74.65 in midday trading, having fallen 5 percent this year to Thursday's close.Priceline reported a 36 percent rise in second-quarter profit as hotel and car booking rose.The deal is expected to close in the third quarter.

284,"   By Christina  Farr | SAN FRANCISCO, June 19  SAN FRANCISCO, June 19 Tired of the social media treadmill and hoping to unplug for a couple days? Consider this fast-growing summer camp three hours outside of San Francisco, where the first ritual involves handing over your personal electronics to volunteers in white lab coats.Camp Grounded, now in its second year, offers hyperconnected attendees a brief respite from the incessant noise of Facebook , Twitter and a plethora of other media relentlessly battling for their attention.The rules of this ""digital detox"" camp are clear: No work talk, no alcohol, no first names or discussion of ages, and most importantly, no phones, computers, tablets or watches.Co-founder Levi Felix, who goes by the nickname ""Fidget Wigglesworth,"" has stressed it is not just an experience for tech workers, although current and former Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Microsoft Corp employees were represented. This year, campers ranged from hipster college grads to recent retirees, he said in an interview Reuters at the Navarro, California camp.The project has gained rapid popularity, reflecting a growing need to unwind from the stresses associated with the Bay Area's tech boom. From just one weekend in the summer of 2013, this year's has grown to three consecutive weekends with several hundred people attending each session. To be sure, the experience is limited to those who can afford it - it costs $570 for camping, meals and activities.""I don't remember the last time I went for four days without checking a notification,"" said Facebook designer Connie Yang, who tried out Camp Grounded this month.Yang, who described the experience as ""powerful,"" said she intends to check her phone far less frequently. She may even experiment with incorporating new product ideas into the Facebook experience to help people ""scale back."" In recent years, the unplugging movement has been gathering steam, although it has been criticized by the press for stirring ""postmodern techno-anxiety"" and failing to recognize the positive impacts of technology. Each March, thousands of people unplug from their devices for 24 hours, as part of an event organized by nonprofit organization Reboot.Brian Solis, a principal analyst for Altimeter Group specializing in digital trends, expects that experiences like Camp Grounded will become more commonplace. ""If these technologies don't have your attention, they can't scale,"" he said, describing the camp as a potential antidote.Solis said it's unlikely that tech companies will tinker with products to make them any less habit-forming. But he predicts that consumers will increasingly crave experiences that help them ""reset"" for a more balanced lifestyle.David Stewart, founder of SocialStudio, a company making social media applications, said it can be a challenge for developers to strike a balance between engaging users and spamming them with notifications.The former vice president of product management at Microsoft-owned Yammer said he was not surprised that the digital detox camp was teeming with techies. Stewart himself attended Camp Grounded in early July.""People designing addictive products are the most aware of the occasional human need to be free from them.""

Those are the task-specific software programs that increasing numbers of consumers use multiple times each day, often on theit mobile phones. The type of database system developed by Couchbase, known as NoSQL, is displacing older types of database systems such as Oracle's MySQL and Microsoft SQL. The newer systems offer more flexibility than the older ones.Spending around NoSQL technology, including on software development, license fees, and hardware, should reach $3.4 billion by 2020, according to consultancy Market Research Media Ltd, up from less than $1 billion last year. Couchbase competitors include MongoDB, which has raised $231 million from venture firms such as Union Square and Sequoia Capital, and DataStax, which has raised $84 million from backers such as Meritech Capital and Lightspeed Ventures. New backers in Couchbase's latest funding round include WestSummit, whose partner Raymond Yang will join Couchbase's board, and Accel Growth. Another family of funds from Accel had previously invested in Couchbase.Existing investors include Adams Street Partners, Ignition Partners, Mayfield Fund, and North Bridge Venture Partners. Couchbase has raised $115 million since its founding in 2009, and counts businesses such as music service Beats and retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc among its customers.

287,"   By Jim Finkle | BOSTON  BOSTON Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) launched what it hopes will be the most successful private effort to date to crack down on cyber crime by moving to disrupt communications channels between hackers and infected PCs.The operation, which began on Monday under an order issued by a federal court in Nevada, targeted traffic involving malicious software known as Bladabindi and Jenxcus, which Microsoft said work in similar ways and were written and distributed by developers in Kuwait and Algeria. It is the first high-profile case involving malware written by developers outside of Eastern Europe, according to Richard Domingues Boscovich, assistant general counsel of Microsoft's cybercrime-fighting Digital Crimes Unit.""We have never seen malware coded outside Eastern Europe that is as big as this. This really demonstrates the globalization of cybercrime,"" said Boscovich, whose team at Microsoft has disrupted nine other cybercrime operations over the past five years, all of which it believes originated in Eastern Europe.He said it would take days to determine how many machines were infected, but noted that the number could be very large because Microsoft's anti-virus software alone has detected some 7.4 million infections over the past year and is installed on less than 30 percent of the world's PCs.The malware has dashboards with point-and-click menus to execute functions such as viewing a computer screen in real time, recording keystrokes, stealing passwords and listening to conversations, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Nevada on June 19 and unsealed Monday.The malware was purchased by at least 500 customers.  Boscovich said the developers marketed their malware over social media, including videos on YouTube and a Facebook page. They posted videos with techniques for infecting PCs, he said.MONDAY'S OPERATION  The court order allowed Microsoft to disrupt communications between infected machines and Reno, Nevada-based Vitalwerks Internet Solutions.Boscovich said about 94 percent of all machines infected with the two viruses communicate with hackers through Vitalwerks servers. Criminals use Vitalwerks as an intermediary to make it more difficult for law enforcement to track, he said.The court ordered the registries that direct Internet communications to send suspected malicious traffic to Microsoft servers in Redmond, Washington, instead of to Vitalwerks.In an operation that begins Monday, Boscovich said, Microsoft will filter out communications from PCs infected with another 194 types of malware also being filtered through Vitalwerks.  Vitalwerks said Microsoft's actions have disrupted service for millions of Internet users.    ""Vitalwerks and (operational subsidiary) No-IP have a very strict abuse policy. Our abuse team is constantly working to keep the No-IP system domains free of spam and malicious activity,"" spokeswoman Natalie Goguen said in a statement.Microsoft has not accused Vitalwerks of involvement in any cybercrime, though it alleges the company failed to take proper steps to prevent its system from being abused.""We just want them to clean up their act, to be more proactive in monitoring their service,"" Boscovich said in an interview.

Microsoft has apologized, blaming ""a technical error"" for the disruption, saying service to customers has been restored.The operation, which began on June 30 under a federal court order, targeted malicious software known as Bladabindi and Jenxcus, which Microsoft said work in similar ways and were written and distributed by developers in Kuwait and Algeria.(Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Richard Chang)",2014-07-10,MSFT,"Thu Jul 10, 2014 | 3:44pm EDT",Microsoft says cybercrime bust frees 4.7 mln infected PCs,http://www.reuters.com//article/cybersecurity-microsoft-idUSL2N0PL1ZE20140710?type=companyNews,-0.8657,0.114,0.794,0.092

297,"   By Eric Kelsey | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling lashed out at his estranged wife following her court testimony on Wednesday in a trial over the $2 billion sale of the NBA team.Sterling, 80, who is fighting to scuttle the deal his wife Shelly Sterling negotiated with former Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, lashed out at his wife when she approached him after her testimony.""Get away from me, you pig!"" Sterling growled, startling his wife who had said she moved to gain control of the family trust that owns the Clippers out of concern for his mental health.""Shelly, how could you lie?"" the real estate billionaire added before apologizing to Judge Michael Levanas for disturbing court.Shelly Sterling, 79, last month asked Los Angeles Superior Court to confirm her as having sole authority to sell the professional basketball franchise after her husband vowed to block the NBA-record sale.Donald Sterling was banned for life by the NBA in April for private racist remarks that were taped and publishedShelly Sterling testified at the probate trial that she had her husband mentally evaluated after he gave a rambling television interview in May shortly after the ban. ""I couldn't believe it and I started crying,"" Shelly Sterling told the court. ""I felt so bad. I couldn't believe that was him.""Shelly Sterling had her husband evaluated by two physicians who determined that he has early-stage Alzheimer's disease and was unable to conduct his own business affairs, handing her control of the trust and the Clippers.""It was just totally out of context and reality,"" Shelly Sterling added while being questioned by her lawyer. ""I thought for his health and my own health that he ought to be tested."" Levanas will decide whether Shelly Sterling acted in accordance with the family trust, and if Donald Sterling's move to revoke the trust after the deal with Ballmer would invalidate the sale.Donald Sterling's attorneys say he was misled by his wife into submitting to medical examinations.In his second day of testimony, Sterling, who was often combative with his own lawyer questioning him, said that his wife moved to assert authority of the trust because she was afraid that the league would seize the team.""My wife is terrified, frightened to death. She can't sleep because she's afraid the NBA will take everything away,"" Sterling said. ""Her motivation was that she scared out of her mind. She cried every night."" The sale to Ballmer has been tentatively approved by the league but must be voted on by other team owners. The trial, however, will not conclude before the deal's July 15 deadline.Ballmer can walk away from the agreement at that date or extend it for another 30 days.His attorney, Adam Streisand, said outside court that he was confident the sale would be completed.The NBA has said it could seize the Clippers and put the franchise up for auction if the deal is not approved by Sept. 15.

298,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO, July 11  SAN FRANCISCO, July 11 An antitrust lawsuit targeting Google's Android operating system should be dismissed, Google said in a court filing on Friday, partly because smartphone manufacturers are free to utilize Android on their phones without also installing Google apps.Two smartphone customers filed a proposed class action lawsuit against Google Inc in May, arguing that the way Google licenses Android to smartphone companies like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd is unfair to Google's competitors for search and other mobile services.The lawsuit is the latest antitrust issue confronting Google, which has faced complaints from rivals including Microsoft Corp that it unfairly ranked its own services higher than competitors' in search results. A proposed settlement with European regulators on that issue is pending.In the U.S. lawsuit, plaintiff lawyers had argued that Google forces phone manufacturers to set its own search engine as the default on Android phones. Google knows consumers will not go through the trouble of changing those default settings, the lawsuit said, putting competitors at an unfair disadvantage given Android's global market share. ""Google badly wants default search engine status because it results in more paid search-related advertisements,"" the lawsuit said, ""which are the source of most of its billions and billions of dollars in annual profits.""But in a filing on Friday in San Jose, California, federal court, Google argued that the U.S. class action should fail because handset manufacturers are not obligated to accept Google apps as a precondition for using Android. Additionally, if a phone manufacturer does opt to install Google apps, they can still preload competing apps as well. Consumers, moreover, are free to customize their own phones and replace Google search as the default.""Google's conduct is not only fully consistent with but actually promotes lawful competition,"" the company wrote. Google also argued that the lawsuit failed to show how Google's agreements with handset manufacturers caused consumers to overpay for their phones.An attorney for the plaintiffs could not immediately be reached for comment. A hearing on the motion to dismiss is currently scheduled for October.The case in U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, is Gary Feitelson and Daniel McKee, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated vs. Google Inc, 14-2007.

311,"  (Adds Xbox details)By Bill RigbySEATTLE, July 17 Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella kicked off one of the largest layoffs in tech history on Thursday, hoping to reshape the aging PC industry titan into a nimbler rival to Apple and Google, and jolt a culture at the company that is used to protecting its existing Windows and Office franchises.Microsoft Corp said on Thursday it will slash up to 18,000 jobs, or 14 percent of its workforce, over the next 12 months as it almost halves the size of its newly acquired Nokia phone business and tries to become a cloud-computing and mobile-friendly software company.The larger-than-expected cuts are the deepest in the software giant's 39-year history and come five months into Nadella's tenure.Beyond the Nokia reductions, Nadella gave few clues about where the ax will fall or what areas will receive more funding.One source briefed on the cuts said a major victim would be the 175-strong Xbox Entertainment Studios unit, which will start to wind down efforts to create original content. But it will continue to work on its highest-profile project, a filmed version of the blockbuster 'Halo' videogame.Nadella said he will answer questions from employees at a town hall meeting at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on Friday and flesh out his plans publicly after Microsoft's quarterly earnings report on July 22.""We will simplify the way we work to drive greater accountability, become more agile and move faster,"" Nadella wrote to employees in a memo made public early Thursday. ""We plan to have fewer layers of management, both top down and sideways, to accelerate the flow of information and decision making.""The size of the cuts were welcomed by Wall Street, which was critical of the Nokia acquisition and viewed Microsoft as bloated under previous CEO Steve Ballmer, topping 127,000 in staff after absorbing Nokia earlier this year.""This is about double what the Street was expecting,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""Nadella is clearing the decks for the new fiscal year. He is cleaning up part of the mess that Ballmer left."" Microsoft shares rose 1.8 percent to $44.88 on Nasdaq, reaching their highest since the technology stock boom of 2000.About 12,500 of the layoffs will come from eliminating overlaps with the Nokia unit, which Microsoft acquired in April for $7.2 billion, with the bulk of the cuts coming from Nokia itself. The acquisition of Nokia's handset business in April added 25,000 people to Microsoft's payroll.The Nokia-related cuts were widely expected. When it struck the deal, Microsoft said it would cut $600 million per year in costs within 18 months of closing the acquisition.Excluding the Nokia cuts, the remaining 5,500 layoffs were not as shocking as it first appeared, said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen.""The aggregate number is still bigger than expected but it's not as big as it comes across,"" he said. ""There's going to be a lot of re-hiring in other areas of the business. On a net basis, the numbers are small."" Microsoft's campus appears to have escaped heavy cuts, at least for now. The first wave of layoffs include 1,351 jobs in the Seattle region, Microsoft said.About 1,100 jobs will be cut from Nokia's original home country of Finland, according to government and union representatives there, with about half coming from the closure of its research and development operation in the northern city of Oulu.Stephen Elop, the former CEO of Nokia who now runs Microsoft's devices unit, said phone engineering efforts will now be concentrated in Salo and Tampere, Finland, and it will reduce engineering work in Beijing and San Diego.He said phone manufacturing will be focused in Hanoi, Vietnam, with some production to continue in Beijing and Dongguan, China. Some Microsoft manufacturing and repair operations will be moved to Manaus, Brazil and Reynosa, Mexico, as it winds down operations in Komaron, Hungary.The EU's employment commissioner said he has asked to meet with Microsoft to discuss the social impact of the layoffs. As part of the integration of Nokia, Microsoft is  abandoning its experiment in making phones powered by Google's Android system, moving some of its Nokia X line of phones onto Windows phone software.The company said it expects to take pretax charges of $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion over the next four quarters to account for the costs of the layoffs.Nadella's cuts are the biggest at the Redmond, Washington-based company since Ballmer axed 5,800, or about 6 percent of headcount, in the depths of the recession in early 2009.The new CEO's moves are designed to help Microsoft shift from being a primarily software-focused company to one that sells online services, apps and devices it hopes will make people and businesses more productive. Nadella needs to make Microsoft a stronger competitor to Google and Apple Inc, which have dominated the new era of mobile-centric computing.Marking this change of emphasis, Nadella last week rebranded Microsoft as ""the productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world.""Microsoft is not alone among the pioneers of the personal computer revolution now slimming down to adapt to the Web-focused world.PC-maker Hewlett-Packard Co is in the midst of a radical three-to-five-year plan that will lop up to 50,000 from its staff of 250,000.International Business Machines Corp is undergoing a  ""workforce rebalancing,"" which analysts say could mean 13,000, or about 3 percent of its staff, being laid off or transferred to new owners as units are sold.Chipmaker Intel Corp and network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc both said in the past year they were cutting about 5 percent of their staff.

317,"  * Africa patent applications under 1 pct of global total* Countries struggling with manual registries, old laws* Microsoft offering free service to list, protect IP* ""Culture of secrecy"" means inventors hiding their ideasBy Helen Nyambura-MwauraJOHANNESBURG, July 17 When Malagasy entrepreneur Andry Ravololonjatovo came up with the idea of a hi-tech translation service named after a local bird, the Drongo, he hesitated about registering the patent.In many countries in Africa, protection of intellectual property (IP) is still patchy or undeveloped, and many innovators are put off by the onerous and expensive affair of registering their products.Despite a wave of technological innovation washing over the continent, many inventors are working in secret, doing without peer feedback for fear of having their ideas pinched by copycats.They are wary too of weak national court systems that are often largely ineffectual in enforcing IP rights.""In the beginning, we thought of just operating without registering due to the arduous and costly process. In addition, protection is only guaranteed for 10 years,"" Drongo's founder Ravololonjatovo told Reuters.Named after a black-feathered bird found in Madagascar that mimics the calls of other birds, Drongo is developing mobile applications for text translations in international languages like English and French. Ravololonjatovo hopes to widen that to software that recognises the oral Malagasy language.""Thinking big, we anticipate what might happen someday as we grow globally, so we need some kind of protection,"" Ravololonjatovo said, adding it was precisely this that prompted him to register with local patent protection authorities.Not surprisingly, the patchy data available on African patent and trademark registrations shows a concentration in the more developed economies, where technology and regulatory and financial frameworks are more firmly established. Figures from the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) show that in 2013, there were 351 international applications from South Africa filed through its Patent Cooperating Treaty (PCT) system.Morocco had 54 filings, Nigeria and Kenya had seven each. Africa accounted for about 500 PCT applications last year, less than 1 percent of more than 205,000 made globally, indicating patent protection is still embryonic on the fast-growing continent.""NOT FOR THE UNINITIATED"" For IP lawyers working across Africa, challenges include infrastructure and systems problems that cause backlogs and delays when searching for, examining and issuing certificates.Some countries such as Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy and oil producer and a favoured foreign investment target, are only now transforming their manual registries into digital format to create a timely and accurate online filing system.Antiquated laws, which can sometimes mean trademarks not being recognised, are now also being reviewed in most states as investor interest blossoms for an African continent rising out of poverty and conflict. But costs can be an obstacle for African innovators who may be struggling to raise funds.For Drongo, its patent protection registration cost $400, a big amount for the small start-up. But the amount of paperwork required for the process and the time spent waiting for it to happen was even more frustrating, Ravololonjatovo said.Trade mark applications in the more expensive territories range between $1,200-$1,700 while patents require between $1,400 and $1,900, according to Johannesburg-based law firm ENS, which represents clients across the continent.But help is at hand. To encourage start-ups to register and protect their IP, Microsoft's 4Afrika initiative has begun a free service to help developers with the process and put lawyers at their disposal if they need to protect their patents.Microsoft is experimenting with the programme in Kenya and hopes to also develop it elsewhere on the continent.Gaelyn Scott, head of the IP department at ENS, said there were signs of greater respect being shown for patents in Kenya, Nigeria, Zimbabwe and Namibia. However, other states like Ethiopia, Mozambique and Angola were proving much more difficult when trying to protect inventors' rights. ""The practice of IP in Africa, the filing, maintenance and enforcement of rights, is not for the uninitiated,"" she said.""CULTURE OF SECRECY"" Louis Otieno, a director with the Microsoft 4Afrika initiative, says tech developers at forums where he speaks are often reticent about sharing their ideas publicly, fearing they may be stolen and copied. They pull him aside after his speeches.""There is a culture of secrecy, which is counterproductive in this day and age in developer work. You should feel confident that what you are developing is yours and have a way of proving it's yours,"" Otieno said.Although most African countries have laws protecting inventions and intellectual property on their books, these are often not tested. There are also only a small number of judges and lawyers on the vast continent well versed with the sector.Often, arguments before an African court or registry were followed by delays in handing down decisions that at times stretched into years, a huge frustration for plaintiffs.ENS' Scott said most of the filings registering trademarks in Africa were by foreigners, who were more familiar with the IP protection concept and procedures from their own countries.South Africa's IP office, for example, received 7,444 patent applications in 2012. Of these, 608 were filed by residents, the rest were by foreign applicants, according to WIPO statistics.Otieno said an increase IP protection court cases being heard in Africa could spur more specialisation and expertise.His advice to African entrepreneurs?""You should not hide but tell everybody who cares to listen, 'See what I have created, use it but pay royalties to use it'"".

318,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO A U.S. consumer lawsuit accusing Google of monopolizing prime real estate on Android smartphones will help mobile rivals like Microsoft make their antitrust case with European regulators should damaging secrets emerge in court.The suit, filed in California federal court in May by two smartphone consumers, said Google requires handset manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) to restrict competing apps like Microsoft's Bing search on Android phones, partly by making Google's own apps the default. Google argued last week the proposed class action should be dismissed because consumers still are free to use the other apps. The plaintiffs counter that most consumers either don't know how to switch default settings, or will not go to the trouble.If a judge lets the lawsuit proceed, plaintiffs' attorneys would be allowed to delve into internal Google emails and contracts with smartphone companies, and could interview Google executives under oath, said Steve Berman, who represents the consumers. ""I'm confident we will get into juicy stuff, and I think that will up the pressure on Google as some of the material we discover becomes public,"" he said. Google declined to comment. A hearing on Google's bid to dismiss the case is scheduled for October.Any damaging evidence from the class action would play into the hands of Google's rivals. Microsoft spokesman Jack Evans said the company ""is not a party"" to the consumer lawsuit, but last year a group of companies - including Microsoft (MSFT.O), Oracle (ORCL.N), Nokia NOK1V.HE, Expedia (EXPE.O) and TripAdvisor (TRIP.O) - filed a complaint with European antitrust regulators over some of the same issues in the U.S. lawsuit.Google apps ""are widely used on Android by requiring default placement and other mechanisms for disadvantaging competing apps,"" the companies said in a summary of their complaint. Google last year said it was working cooperatively with European regulators, who have yet to decide whether to formally investigate.  MICROSOFT TIES Berman has a long history of taking on large U.S. companies. He reached a settlement for consumers suing Apple (AAPL.O) over its e-book sales practices that could reach $450 million, and  settled for $1.6 billion a lawsuit on behalf of Toyota (7203.T) car owners with unintended acceleration claims.But the Seattle-based plaintiffs' lawyer also has represented one of Google's main rivals. Berman defended Microsoft when it faced its own antitrust investigations over Windows. Berman said he has had ""conversations with Microsoft over the years about Google's conduct,"" but not about this lawsuit.No stranger to antitrust inquiries, Google was scrutinized by U.S. and European regulators over allegations that it improperly manipulated search results to rank its own services higher than competitors.  U.S. authorities ultimately closed their investigation without filing a lawsuit, and Europe's competition commissioner negotiated a settlement earlier this year which is awaiting approval by the broader European Commission. PRIME REAL ESTATE The main issue for U.S. courts will be whether Android and mobile services like search are ""technically separate, or tied in ways that impedes competition for consumers,"" said Michael Cusumano, a professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management.  Cusumano has extensively researched Microsoft, which unsuccessfully sued the professor in the 1990s for access to his notes. This year Microsoft has sought to hire him to write an expert opinion in an unrelated proceeding.The U.S. consumer lawsuit is based largely on contracts between Google and Android manufacturers Samsung and HTC (2498.TW) that became public during Oracle's separate 2012 trial against Google. If Samsung or HTC wishes to use Google apps on its phones, the consumer lawsuit said, they must preload a suite of services - including YouTube and Maps - on ""prime screen real estate"" on the phones, and set Google search as the default. It also argues that Google's deal with Apple to be the default search on iPhones and iPads locks out competitors across the mobile universe. Apple does not have its own search engine, has lower market share worldwide than Android and is not a defendant in the case. Google's deals with handset makers do not prevent rival search engines ""from reaching consumers through the various distribution channels available to them,"" Google wrote in its motion to dismiss the U.S. lawsuit. Cusumano said the U.S. class action could hurt Google if a judge finds that it improperly pushes its mapping and location services, which is embedded across the Android system.It's ""kind of a Pandora's Box to look inside what Google does, and the relationship it has with all these smartphone and handset manufacturers,"" he said.

319,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK, July 18  NEW YORK, July 18 A federal judge in New York has granted prosecutors access to a Gmail user's emails as part of a criminal probe, in a decision that could fan the debate over how aggressively the government may pursue data if doing so may invade people's privacy.U.S. Magistrate Judge Gabriel Gorenstein said on Friday he had authorized a warrant to be served on Google Inc  for the emails of an unnamed individual who is the target of a money laundering investigation.Gorenstein said his decision ran counter to several other federal judges' rulings in similar cases, including in Washington, D.C., and Kansas, that sweeping warrants may give the government improper access to too many emails, not just relevant ones.But he said the law lets investigators review broad swaths of documents to decide which are covered by warrants.""Courts have long recognized the practical need for law enforcement to exercise dominion over documents not within the scope of the warrant in question to determine whether they fall within the warrant,"" he said. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The ruling came three months after U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis in New York said prosecutors can force Microsoft Corp to hand over a customer's email stored in an Ireland data center.Microsoft has appealed, in what is seen as the first challenge by a company to a search warrant seeking data stored overseas. Companies including Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc have filed briefs in support of Microsoft, as has the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an advocacy group. A hearing is set for July 31 before U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in New York.The government's ability to seize personal digital information has grown more contentious since former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked secret documents in June 2013 to several media outlets outlining the agency's massive data collection programs. In June, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court ruled that police officers almost always need a warrant to search an arrested suspect's cellphone, citing concerns about privacy rights. In doing so, the court noted the enormous wealth of data contained on mobile devices, including emails and photos.Earlier this year, a magistrate judge in Washington, D.C., rejected a warrant seeking to review an Apple Inc email account of a defense contractor as part of a kickback investigation.Last year, a magistrate judge in Kansas tossed warrant applications for emails and instant messages stored at Google, Verizon, Yahoo! Inc, Microsoft unit Skype and GoDaddy for five individuals suspected in a stolen computer equipment case.In both decisions, the judges said the warrants were overly broad.On the other hand, several U.S. appeals courts have rejected motions to suppress such searches, concluding that investigators are permitted to search entire accounts for relevant emails, Gorenstein said.

320,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft Corp said it aims to get its loss-making Nokia phone unit to break even within two years, helping its stock rise in after-hours trade.The world's largest software company reported a 7 percent dip in quarterly profit on Tuesday, chiefly due to incorporating the struggling handset business of the Finnish mobile pioneer.Microsoft's chief financial officer said in a call with analysts that the company plans to take $1 billion in costs out of the Nokia operation and stop its losses by fiscal 2016 - which ends in June 2016 - following massive job cuts announced last week.That cheered Wall Street, which was not expecting such decisive action.""The expense guidance around Nokia was much better than feared,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""While there is still some heavy lifting ahead, it appears brighter days are on the horizon for Microsoft after a decade of pain and frustration."" Microsoft shares hit new 14-year highs over the past week, and were up 1.1 percent at $45.33 after hours. Nokia, which Microsoft bought in April for $7.2 billion in an attempt to take on Apple Inc and Samsung directly in the fast-growing smartphone market, added almost $2 billion to Microsoft's quarterly revenue, but posted an operating loss of $692 million, which included some one-time costs.Nokia's Lumia smartphones, while well-reviewed, have not been as successful as Microsoft hoped, capturing no more than 4 percent of the global market. Lumia sales hit 5.8 million for the nine weeks of the quarter that Nokia was part of Microsoft. That compares with 35.2 million iPhone sales in the quarter.     Microsoft is in the process of drastically reducing Nokia's operation, closing some facilities and cutting about half of its 25,000 workforce, as it looks to rein in costs and refocus on cloud-computing under a plan launched by new Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella last week. ""We will be relentless in our focus on our core, agile work and life experiences and the two platforms that support it, the cloud operating system and the device operating system and hardware,"" said Nadella on the call with analysts.A slight recovery in the personal computer market, which was essentially flat over the past three months after two years of declines, helped sales of Microsoft's core Windows and Office products in the quarter. Overall quarterly revenue rose 17 percent to $23.38 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $23 billion, although the bulk of that was due to the addition of sales from Nokia.Microsoft reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit of $4.61 billion, or 55 cents per share, compared with $4.96 billion, or 59 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.Wall Street had expected 60 cents per share, on average, although it is not clear how analysts had factored in the performance and cost of integrating the Nokia operation.

Chipotle Mexican Grill was the S&P 500's biggest percentage gainer, up 11.8 percent at $659.77 a day after the burrito chain reported a steep jump in profit.Netflix Inc, one of the market's biggest trading favorites over the past few years, reported a quarterly profit that more than doubled on Monday after the market closed. However, on Tuesday, Netflix shares fell 4.6 percent to $431.09 as the company's plans to expand in Europe were seen as eroding profits. With 23 percent of S&P 500 companies having reported results, 66.1 percent posted earnings that topped expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, above the long-term average of 63 percent. More than 64 percent have beaten revenue forecasts, above the long-term average of 61 percent.""So far earnings have been pretty robust, better than a lot of people were looking for, including on the forward guidance side,"" said William Greiner, chief investment officer at Mariner Wealth Advisors in Leawood, Kansas. ""There are some concerns about valuation, but stocks remain a more attractive asset class than bonds.""After the closing bell, Microsoft Corp reported a rise in revenue, though earnings fell in part due to the effect of incorporating the handset business of Nokia, which it acquired in April. Microsoft's stock was flat at $44.83 in extended-hours trading.Apple Inc reported third-quarter earnings that topped expectations, though revenue missed forecasts. Apple's stock initially fell in after-hours trading, though it subsequently turned higher, rising 0.3 percent to $95. During Tuesday's regular session, homebuilders' stocks represented one of the strongest sectors. The housing index  gained 1 percent after data showed that existing home sales hit an eight-month high in June. D.R. Horton Inc  rose 1.9 percent to $24.30 while Beazer Homes advanced 2 percent to $19.21.The U.S. Consumer Price Index rose in June, although the overall trend pointed to a slow buildup of inflation pressures, conditions that could allow the U.S. Federal Reserve to keep gradually easing its stimulus programs.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 61.81 points or 0.36 percent, to end at 17,113.54. The S&P 500 gained 9.90 points or 0.50 percent, to 1,983.53. The Nasdaq Composite  added 31.31 points or 0.71 percent, to 4,456.02.The S&P 500 hit an intraday record high just above 1,986, the latest in a series of such records. Equities have been strong in 2014, with July on track to be the S&P 500's sixth straight monthly advance. Abroad, pro-Russian rebels agreed to hand over the black boxes from the Malaysian Airlines plane shot down last week near the Ukraine-Russia border and the Malaysian government negotiated the release of the remains of nearly 300 victims.Traders also kept an eye on the Middle East as Israel pounded targets across the Gaza Strip and said no cease-fire was near. Top U.S. and U.N. diplomats pursued talks to stop fighting that has claimed more than 600 lives, an overwhelming majority from inside Gaza.""We're worried about the situation in Gaza and Ukraine, but it is hard to put a dollars-and-cents amount to it,"" said Greiner, who helps oversee $33 billion in assets. ""It's important, but more of a sentiment issue.""In other earnings news, United Technologies Corp  shares fell 1.9 percent to $110.86 despite the company's strong outlook. Coca-Cola Co dropped 2.9 percent to $41.19 after the soft drinks company's sales missed estimates. The Travelers Companies Inc shares dropped 3.8 percent to $91.63 after hail and wind storms in the United States increased the insurer's catastrophe losses. All three companies are Dow components.Billionaire activist investor William Ackman's latest volley of accusations against Herbalife fell flat on Wall Street, with the nutrition company's shares soaring 25.5 percent to $67.77.About two-thirds of the stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange closed higher for the day while about 65 percent of Nasdaq-listed shares closed in positive territory.About 5.05 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data, below the month-to-date average of 5.56 billion.

But the agreement has been criticized, both by tech companies and European politicians, as inadequate.

330,"  (Changes wording in paragraph four to show Almunia said he would not conduct a formal market test, instead of that he would not consult complainants)SAN FRANCISCO/FRANKFURT, July 22 European Union antitrust regulators are preparing to step up investigations of Google Inc's practices on several fronts and are likely to revise certain terms of a settlement involving its search engine that was proposed earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.Google has been the target of a European Commission investigation since November 2010, when more than a dozen complainants, including Microsoft Corp, accused the company of promoting its own services at their expense.In February, Google agreed to make concessions on how it displays competitors' links, striking a deal that ended a three-year antitrust probe and avoided a hefty fine.But the agreement has been criticized, both by tech companies and European politicians, as inadequate. Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said at the time he would accept Google's concessions without conducting a formal market test, prompting a furious response. On Tuesday, the Commission said it was considering formal complaints to the agreement and aimed to make a decision on the matter in September.""We have written to the formal complainants in the ongoing proceedings and we have not received yet all their replies,"" a spokesman for the Commission said. ""In early August all replies will have been submitted. We will then thoroughly analyze the arguments they contain and, depending on the outcome of that analysis, the next steps will be decided by Mr. Almunia in September."" Google may face other investigations, including regarding its Android operating system for smartphones.The European Commission recently sent a fresh request for information to handset makers on their dealings with Android, which runs on roughly four-fifths of the world's smartphones. That line of inquiry is likely to turn into a formal investigation, the Journal reporting, citing a person with knowledge of the situation. Last month, Almunia said he could initiate an investigation of YouTube if he saw any attempt by Google to abuse its dominance of online video searching.In a guest editorial for German newspaper Bild on Tuesday, Martin Shulz, head of the EU Parliament, argued that the decision on how to treat Google should not be taken by an outgoing Commission. Almunia will vacate his post later this year.""The EU has to make the decision on how to deal with Google with care,"" he said in the editorial. ""It cannot be that we've been discussing Google for months, and that the decision takes place when half of Europe is on holiday.""Google did not respond to a request for comment.

334,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft Corp said it aims to get its loss-making Nokia phone unit to break even within two years, helping its stock rise in after-hours trade.The world's largest software company reported a 7 percent dip in quarterly profit on Tuesday, chiefly due to incorporating the struggling handset business of the Finnish mobile pioneer.Microsoft's chief financial officer said in a call with analysts that the company plans to take $1 billion in costs out of the Nokia operation and stop its losses by fiscal 2016 - which ends in June 2016 - following massive job cuts announced last week.That cheered Wall Street, which was not expecting such decisive action.""The expense guidance around Nokia was much better than feared,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""While there is still some heavy lifting ahead, it appears brighter days are on the horizon for Microsoft after a decade of pain and frustration."" Microsoft shares hit new 14-year highs over the past week, and were up 1.1 percent at $45.33 after hours. Nokia, which Microsoft bought in April for $7.2 billion in an attempt to take on Apple Inc and Samsung directly in the fast-growing smartphone market, added almost $2 billion to Microsoft's quarterly revenue, but posted an operating loss of $692 million, which included some one-time costs.Nokia's Lumia smartphones, while well-reviewed, have not been as successful as Microsoft hoped, capturing no more than 4 percent of the global market. Lumia sales hit 5.8 million for the nine weeks of the quarter that Nokia was part of Microsoft. That compares with 35.2 million iPhone sales in the quarter.     Microsoft is in the process of drastically reducing Nokia's operation, closing some facilities and cutting about half of its 25,000 workforce, as it looks to rein in costs and refocus on cloud-computing under a plan launched by new Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella last week. ""We will be relentless in our focus on our core, agile work and life experiences and the two platforms that support it, the cloud operating system and the device operating system and hardware,"" said Nadella on the call with analysts.A slight recovery in the personal computer market, which was essentially flat over the past three months after two years of declines, helped sales of Microsoft's core Windows and Office products in the quarter. Overall quarterly revenue rose 17 percent to $23.38 billion, above analysts' average estimate of $23 billion, although the bulk of that was due to the addition of sales from Nokia.Microsoft reported fiscal fourth-quarter profit of $4.61 billion, or 55 cents per share, compared with $4.96 billion, or 59 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.Wall Street had expected 60 cents per share, on average, although it is not clear how analysts had factored in the performance and cost of integrating the Nokia operation.

340,"   By Eric Kelsey | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES The record $2 billion sale of pro basketball's Los Angeles Clippers to former Microsoft Corp chief executive Steve Ballmer can proceed over the objections of co-owner Donald Sterling, a judge tentatively ruled on Monday.    Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Levanas said the deal, brokered by Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly Sterling, was permissible and could be consummated even if Sterling, who has been banned for life from the NBA for racist remarks, chose to appeal.""She had every good reason to believe that Donald agreed to the sale of the team,"" Levanas said.The ruling was a major victory for the NBA and Shelly Sterling, who had asked the probate judge to confirm her as the trustee of the family trust that owns the Clippers after having her 80-year-old husband removed when neurologists deemed him to have early Alzheimer's disease and was unable to handle business affairs. Shelly Sterling, 79, cried after the ruling in the emotionally charged nine-day trial and told reporters outside the courtroom ""either way we'd win. I am just doing what I had to do."" She said she believed Donald Sterling's ban from the NBA would be lifted.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling after derogatory remarks he made about black people in private to a woman friend were recorded and then published. Sterling had vowed to block the sale he initially blessed because he said his wife improperly removed him as a trustee of the family trust that owns the Clippers.The NBA, looking to close a chapter that brought shame to the basketball league and outraged fans, said it was ""pleased"" with the court's decision. ""We look forward to the transaction closing as soon as possible,"" NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement.The judge said his tentative ruling would take formal effect when he issues it in writing in coming weeks.

341,"  (Adds NBA reaction, legal expert comment)By Eric KelseyLOS ANGELES, July 28 The record $2 billion sale of pro basketball's Los Angeles Clippers to former Microsoft Corp chief executive Steve Ballmer can proceed over the objections of co-owner Donald Sterling, a judge tentatively ruled on Monday.Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Levanas said the deal, brokered by Sterling's estranged wife, Shelly Sterling, was permissible and could be consummated even if Sterling, who has been banned for life from the NBA for racist remarks, chose to appeal.""She had every good reason to believe that Donald agreed to the sale of the team,"" Levanas said.The ruling was a major victory for the NBA and Shelly Sterling, who had asked the probate judge to confirm her as the trustee of the family trust that owns the Clippers after having her 80-year-old husband removed when neurologists deemed him to have early Alzheimer's disease and was unable to handle business affairs. Shelly Sterling, 79, cried after the ruling in the emotionally charged nine-day trial and told reporters outside the courtroom ""either way we'd win. I am just doing what I had to do.""She said she believed Donald Sterling's ban from the NBA would be lifted.NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling after derogatory remarks he made about black people in private to a woman friend were recorded and then published. Sterling had vowed to block the sale he initially blessed because he said his wife improperly removed him as a trustee of the family trust that owns the Clippers. The NBA, looking to close a chapter that brought shame to the basketball league and outraged fans, said it was ""pleased"" with the court's decision.""We look forward to the transaction closing as soon as possible,"" NBA spokesman Mike Bass said in a statement. The judge said his tentative ruling would take formal effect when he issues it in writing in coming weeks.Ed McCaffery, a professor of law at University of Southern California, said Donald Sterling will likely appeal the ruling, but is highly unlikely to be able to derail the timetable of the sale.""He can appeal as much as he likes, but the Clippers are going to be sold to Ballmer,"" McCaffery said.Donald Sterling, who has owned the Clippers for 33 years, has also sued the NBA, the league commissioner and his wife, contending the team was illegally taken from him.Bradley Shear, a sports attorney, called the ruling a ""complete and total"" victory for Shelly Sterling, but not a surprising one, as she was extremely careful in how she used the rules of the family trust to have Sterling removed as a trustee.

355,"  SEATTLE, July 30 Microsoft Corp added wireless industry pioneer John Stanton to its board on Wednesday, bolstering experience in the mobile sector it has struggled to crack.The move to appoint Stanton, who until last year was the chairman of wireless broadband company Clearwire Corp, comes six months into the leadership of new Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, whose motto for the company is ""mobile-first, cloud-first"", veering away from its historical strength in PC software.Investors have applauded Nadella's forward-looking stance, but still have concerns about the $7.2 billion purchase this year of Nokia, which thrust Microsoft directly into the phone market, but has yet to deliver results with only about 4 percent of smartphones globally running Windows software. ""John's insights into mobility around the globe and his expertise in working with organizations as CEO and as a board member will be invaluable as we transform Microsoft for growth and leadership in the mobile-first, cloud-first world,"" said Nadella in a statement. In the 1980s, Stanton was a senior executive at McCaw Cellular, which led the way in the nascent wireless industry, later becoming part of AT&T. Between 1995 and 2003, he led  VoiceStream Wireless, which was bought by Deutsche Telekom  and later renamed T-Mobile USA. He went on to become a director and then chairman at Clearwire from 2008 to 2013. Microsoft now has 11 board members, including former CEOs Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates. Earlier this year the company's board saw the addition of Mason Morfit, a president of activist investor ValueAct Capital, which has been skeptical of Microsoft's forays into the hardware market.

Respondents have been given until early September to reply to more than 40 questions.While any company is free to use the open-source Android as they choose, mobile handset makers that want to use the newest version must sign a contract that stipulates a minimum number of Google services be pre-installed on devices, according to a third source, a former Google executive with knowledge of the matter.The impending Android inquiry adds to a growing list of regulatory challenges that complicate the Internet company's ambitions in a vital market. Europe accounted for more than $30 billion in digital advertising spending in 2013.The European Commission is likely to start a formal probe into Android once it wraps up an investigation into whether Google ranks its own services higher than those of its rivals in search results, according to the two people with knowledge of the matter.One of the sources said going after Android would help stem a growing chorus of complaints.Google struck a deal with Almunia in February by agreeing to display rivals' links more prominently, but the preliminary settlement was criticized as inadequate by rivals such as Microsoft Corp, U.S. consumer review site Yelp Inc and German and Spanish publishers, as well as some European politicians.Outgoing European Commission antitrust chief Joaquin Almunia may decide to open a second case against Google at the same time he announces the closing of the first, the source said.

The console will cost 3,699 yuan ($600) without the Kinect motion detection system and 4,299 yuan ($700) with Kinect.In the United States, the Xbox One with Kinect costs $499 and without it is $399, a difference of more than $200 compared with the respective prices in China. In September last year, Microsoft reached a deal with Chinese internet TV set-top box maker BesTV New Media Co Ltd  to form a joint venture to manufacture the consoles in Shanghai's Free Trade Zone.Zhang Dazhong, a senior vice president at Shanghai Media Group, the parent of BesTV New Media, said at the event the Xbox launch had been approved by the government.

359,"  (Repeats to widen distribution)  (Adds statement from Microsoft, comments by analyst, details of case, background on industry; in paragraphs 7, 10-11 and 14-26)By Joseph AxNEW YORK, July 31 Microsoft Corp must turn over a customer's emails stored in a data center in Ireland to the U.S. government, a U.S. judge ruled on Thursday in a case that has drawn concern from privacy groups and major technology companies.Microsoft and other U.S. companies had challenged a criminal search warrant for the emails, arguing federal prosecutors cannot seize customer information held in foreign countries.But following a two-hour court hearing in New York, U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska said the warrant lawfully required the company to hand over any data it controlled, regardless of where it was stored.""It is a question of control, not a question of the location of that information,"" Preska said.The judge said she would temporarily suspend her order from taking effect to allow Microsoft to appeal to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.The case appears to be the first in which a corporation has challenged a U.S. search warrant seeking data held abroad.It comes amid a debate over privacy and technology that erupted last year when former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed the government's efforts to collect huge amounts of consumer data around the world.AT&T Inc, Apple Inc, Cisco Systems Inc  and Verizon Communications Inc all submitted court briefs in support of Microsoft, along with the privacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation. The companies are worried they could lose billions of dollars in revenue to foreign competitors if customers fear their data is subject to seizure by U.S. investigators anywhere in the world.In a statement, Microsoft's general counsel, Brad Smith, said the company would appeal.""The only issue that was certain this morning was that the district court's decision would not represent the final step in this process,"" he said.Thursday's ruling concerned a warrant New York prosecutors served on Microsoft for an individual's emails stored in Dublin, Ireland. A magistrate judge in April ruled the warrant was valid.It is unclear what type of investigation led to the warrant, which remains under seal. U.S. companies say they have been hurt by fears about government intrusion: companies such as Cisco, Qualcomm Inc , International Business Machines Corp, Microsoft, and Hewlett-Packard Co reported declines in China sales since the Snowden leaks.European telecom carriers such as Orange and Deutsche Telekom started pitching local data storage soon afterward, and companies from start-up Silent Circle to software giant SAP SE have also sought to capitalize.In August last year, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation estimated the Snowden revelations could cost the American cloud computing industry $22 billion to $35 billion over the next three years.U.S. judges are grappling with privacy concerns over personal data. The U.S. Supreme Court in June ruled that police officers almost always need a warrant to search an arrested suspect's cellphone, noting the enormous wealth of data on mobile devices. Several magistrate judges across the country also have been divided on whether prosecutors can use search warrants to seize emails from providers.Craig Newman, a lawyer who follows privacy legal issues and attended Thursday's hearing, said the issue was far from settled.""One thing we can say is that traditional notions of search and seizure and fourth amendment law don't fit comfortably in the digital world,"" said Newman, who is not involved in the case.Joshua Rosenkranz, a lawyer for Microsoft, said in court that the law does not permit warrants to be executed overseas and called the request a bid for ""extraordinary power.""But Serrin Turner, a prosecutor from the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, said the warrant did not involve a search in Ireland but simply required Microsoft to provide documents it controls.""It makes no sense for Congress to make the government go on a wild-goose chase ... when the provider is sitting here in this country and can access the data at the touch of a button,"" he said.And Preska pointed out that U.S. banks have long been required to provide records in response to subpoenas, even when stored overseas.Rosenkranz raised the specter of foreign governments turning the tables and seeking U.S.-based data via warrants issued in their own countries, which he said would be an ""astounding"" violation of our sovereignty.Preska acknowledged that such a scenario was ""pretty scary"" but said she could not consider the potential actions of other governments when interpreting the law.

HTC is also working on a smartwatch with Silicon Valley internet giant Google Inc, but Chang wouldn't say when the product would hit the market.But it will take more than a few new gadgets to convince company watchers that the firm has turned a corner.Sales at the beleaguered phone company, which once sold one out of every 10 smartphones worldwide, have only notched two months of year-on-year growth out of the past 32.Total third-quarter revenue is also likely to decline slightly compared with the same period of 2013. The firm will look for efficiencies in its sales and marketing operations in order to maintain profitability, Chang said, adding that it would not reduce headcount.These cost-saving measures have already started to take effect, as HTC previously reported higher-than-expected second-quarter net profit of T$2.26 billion.The firm is also expecting to eke out a slight net profit in the third quarter, Chang predicted.Chang noted that the firm is willing to sacrifice profit margins in order to drive volume, though he emphasized that HTC would not sell its products at a loss in exchange for market share. HTC's share of the global smartphone market was a slim 1.4 percent in the first quarter of 2014, according to research firm Gartner.As Apple Inc likely prepares to launch a new large-screen iPhone model, industry watchers remain skeptical that HTC can return to a steady growth model.""Given the shortened life cycle of smartphones and the introduction of Apple's new iPhones, we believe HTC's recovery in the second quarter is temporary,"" SinoPac Securities analyst Calvin Huang wrote in a research note issued ahead of the quarterly conference.BRAND IMAGE Many blame HTC's lack of a compelling message and failure  to stand out from competitors like Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  and China's Xiaomi Inc an increasingly important factor as smartphones, especially high-priced, high-margin models, no longer sell in the huge volumes of the past.Growth in the worldwide smartphone market will slow to 23 percent this year from 39 percent in 2013, according to researcher IDC.

In a statement, Samsung said it will review the complaint ""in detail"" and determine an appropriate response. Microsoft is trying to compete in the mobile market with products that run on Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android operating system. As part of that landscape, Microsoft has tried to raise the costs for Android handset makers by convincing them to pay Microsoft patent royalties. Most large handset makers, such as Samsung, LG (066570.KS) and HTC (2498.TW), have agreed to pay. Motorola is one of the main holdouts, and that company has been in litigation against Microsoft since 2010.   Samsung made its royalty payments to Microsoft during the first fiscal year after they signed their 2011 agreement, the lawsuit said. However after Microsoft announced the Nokia deal last year, Samsung initially refused to make another payment, the lawsuit said. In refusing to pay Microsoft, Samsung argued the Nokia deal breached its licensing agreement with Microsoft, the lawsuit said. Samsung eventually paid Microsoft late, the lawsuit said, but has refused to pay interest.  Samsung also claims smartphone products sold by Microsoft after the Nokia deal are not covered by the licensing deal, the lawsuit said. Microsoft has asked a judge to make an opposite finding.The lawsuit in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York is Microsoft Corp vs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, 14-6039.

As part of that landscape, Microsoft has tried to raise the costs for Android handset makers by convincing them to pay Microsoft patent royalties. Most large handset makers, such as Samsung, LG  and HTC, have agreed to pay. Motorola is one of the main holdouts, and that company has been in litigation against Microsoft since 2010.Samsung made its royalty payments to Microsoft during the first fiscal year after they signed their 2011 agreement, the lawsuit said. However after Microsoft announced the Nokia deal last year, Samsung initially refused to make another payment, the lawsuit said. In refusing to pay Microsoft, Samsung argued the Nokia deal breached its licensing agreement with Microsoft, the lawsuit said. Samsung eventually paid Microsoft late, the lawsuit said, but has refused to pay interest.Samsung also claims smartphone products sold by Microsoft after the Nokia deal are not covered by the licensing deal, the lawsuit said. Microsoft has asked a judge to make an opposite finding.The lawsuit in U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York is Microsoft Corp vs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, 14-6039.

379,"  SEATTLE A former Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) employee was sentenced to two years in prison on Friday for his part in an insider trading scheme that netted him and his partner more than $400,000. Brian Jorgenson, 32, had pleaded guilty to securities fraud for his part in a sophisticated operation in which he passed private information he gleaned from his job as a corporate finance manager at Microsoft to a former colleague who traded stocks and options.""It is important that you serve as a public example,"" U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman said in handing down the sentence in Seattle federal court.Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 2-1/2 years for Jorgenson, who they say was the instigator of the scheme. Jorgenson, a father of four with no history of crime, had asked for one year and a day imprisonment, plus 500 hours of community service.Jorgenson's day-trader accomplice Sean Stokke, 29, was sentenced to 1-1/2 years in prison two weeks ago. The maximum penalty for insider trading is 20 years. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission jointly charged the two men in December with operating an insider trading scheme. Jorgenson was fired by Microsoft soon after the scheme came to light.According to charging documents, the pair's cooperation began in April 2012 when Jorgenson found out through his job in Microsoft's treasury department that the software company was planning a multi-million-dollar investment in the digital business of bookseller Barnes & Noble Inc. (BKS.N) He passed that information to Stokke, who bought options betting that Barnes & Noble's stock would rise. The stock jumped about 50 percent when the investment was announced in late April 2012, reaping Stokke a profit of more than $184,000, prosecutors said. Stokke, who had previously worked with Jorgenson at an asset management company, shared the profits with his partner via envelopes stuffed with $10,000 in cash, according to the charges, which resulted from probes by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission.The pair repeated a similar process twice in the following 18 months, prosecutors said, buying options on Microsoft stock or an exchange-traded fund prior to the release of earnings that Jorgenson knew would surprise Wall Street and cause sharp moves in the stock.

380,"  SEATTLE Aug 8 A former Microsoft Corp  employee was sentenced to two years in prison on Friday for his part in an insider trading scheme that netted him and his partner more than $400,000.Brian Jorgenson, 32, had pleaded guilty to securities fraud for his part in a sophisticated operation in which he passed private information he gleaned from his job as a corporate finance manager at Microsoft to a former colleague who traded stocks and options.""It is important that you serve as a public example,"" U.S. District Judge Marsha Pechman said in handing down the sentence in Seattle federal court.Prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 2-1/2 years for Jorgenson, who they say was the instigator of the scheme. Jorgenson, a father of four with no history of crime, had asked for one year and a day imprisonment, plus 500 hours of community service.Jorgenson's day-trader accomplice Sean Stokke, 29, was sentenced to 1-1/2 years in prison two weeks ago.

381,"  LOS ANGELES Steve Ballmer, the former head of Microsoft, has completed his $2 billion purchase of the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, ending a saga that began when former team owner Donald Sterling was heard making racist remarks to his girlfriend on a tape recording.The deal closed after a California appeals court confirmed the right of Sterling's estranged wife Shelly to sell the team on behalf of the Sterling Family Trust, the National Basketball Association said on Tuesday. The NBA Board of Governors had approved the sale, and has added Ballmer as a Clippers member of board of governors.The $2 billion price tag for the franchise was the highest paid for an NBA team. The team, which began in 1970 as the Buffalo Braves, has never won a NBA championship and last year finished with a 57-25 record, losing in the Western Conference semifinals to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Shelly Sterling struck the deal with Ballmer in May, a month after the NBA banned her 80-year old husband, following revelations of his privately taped remarks imploring the girlfriend, V. Stiviano, not to publicly associate with black people.  Sterling's remarks, which were made during the Clippers' playoff run, sparked public outrage and prompted sponsors to cut ties with the team. The team's interim CEO, Richard Parsons, testified at a probate trial that head coach Doc Rivers was ready to quit if Sterling remained the owner the team and that the team's players would do the same. The 58 year old Ballmer is worth an estimated $21.3 billion, according to Forbes magazine, and is the 31st wealthiest person in the United States.

382,"   By Jeremy Wagstaff and Gerry Shih  On a trip to Beijing a decade ago, Bill Gates was asked by a senior government official how much money Microsoft Corp made in China. The official asked the interpreter to double check Gates' reply as he couldn't believe the figure was so low.It's a problem that hasn't gone away. Indeed, Microsoft's current issues in China conceal a deeper problem for the U.S. software giant - despite the popularity of its Windows operating system and Office suite, few people in emerging markets are willing to pay for legitimate copies.This not only costs Microsoft in lost revenue, but is also holding back the spread of its newest Windows 8 version - analysts say even buyers of pirate software prefer older versions. According to StatCounter, a website that tracks what software is loaded on Internet-connected computers, more than 90 percent of PCs in China - now the world's biggest market - are running pre-8 versions of Windows.Microsoft is trying to tackle this. This year it's offering Windows 8 at a discount to PC manufacturers who install its Bing search engine as the default. And it's giving away versions of Windows 8 for phones and some tablets.But, as the industry shifts from desktop to mobile, the cloud and free or cheap software, China sums up both the old and new challenges Microsoft faces in making money in emerging markets - and, increasingly, in developed ones.""The great danger for the company is that what has happened to them in emerging markets - basically no revenue from new PCs because of piracy - is not far off what's happening everywhere,"" said Ben Thompson, the Taiwan-based author of stratechery.com, a popular technology blog.CORE COST For sure, China is a major, and unique, headache for Microsoft. Many of the problems are tied to a broader push by the Chinese government to limit foreign firms' dominance and encourage local technology firms to become viable competitors. After years of healthy relations with Beijing, Microsoft last month was suddenly targeted by anti-monopoly regulators who raided its China offices as part of a price-fixing investigation.But the spats mask the fact that Microsoft has never really cracked how to get people in emerging markets to pay for its software. The company rarely breaks out revenues by geography, but it has provided clues about the size of the problem.In 2011, then CEO Steve Ballmer reportedly told employees that, because of piracy, Microsoft earned less revenue in China than in the Netherlands - with 1 percent of its population - even though China bought as many computers as the United States.According to the BSA anti-piracy lobby group that Microsoft co-founded, emerging markets account for 56 percent of all PCs in use, and 73 percent of software piracy. Of the $77.8 billion revenue Microsoft generated in its 2013 financial year, China, Brazil and Russia each ""exceeded"" $1 billion, according to a Microsoft presentation. For comparison, Apple Inc generated $27 billion in Greater China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan, in its 2013 financial year. For Microsoft, that's a lot of lost revenue from the heart of its business. ""Windows and Office are still very much the core of Microsoft,"" says Sameer Singh, an India-based analyst.The most recent breakdown by Microsoft of its results by product line - for the first quarter of fiscal 2014 - shows that 56 percent of its global revenue and 78 percent of operating profit came from Windows and Office.Microsoft doesn't just lose the revenue from pirate copies, it also loses access to customers who might buy other Microsoft products that work with or on top of Windows and Office.Across most markets, Windows and Office account for more than half of revenues, says Andrew Pickup, Microsoft's Asia PR chief. This, analysts say, is because many of Microsoft's other products, such as Exchange and Windows servers, depend on customers already using Windows and Office.""The Microsoft ecosystem is obviously pretty interconnected,"" says Jan Dawson of U.S.-based Jackdaw Research. ""So it makes sense that the proportion of revenue would be similar in emerging markets.""NAKED PCS Part of the intractability of piracy in emerging markets is that each part of the chain poses a problem. For PC makers working on wafer-thin margins the operating system is one of the costliest parts of the machine, while mom-and-pop shops which form the bulk of retailers in such markets can't afford to turn away price-sensitive customers who are comfortable buying pirate software.The problem, therefore, starts with computer makers, Singh says, since ""convincing them to ship every PC with Windows pre-installed is difficult."" Margins on PCs for a company like Lenovo Group Ltd are ""near single digits,"" says Bryan Wang, an analyst at Gartner.The result is that up to 60 percent of PCs shipped in the emerging markets of Asia, says IDC research manager Handoko Andi, have no Windows operating system pre-installed - so-called 'naked PCs', which usually instead carry some free, open source operating system like Linux. That compares with about 25 percent in the region's developed markets like Japan and Australia.A quick scan of Taobao, the popular Chinese e-commerce site operated by Alibaba, shows a vast selection of PCs shipped with Linux rather than Windows. Once the machines hit the retailers, it's hard to tell where legitimate software stops and piracy begins.On a recent morning in Zhongguancun, a teeming electronics hub in north Beijing, shopkeepers offered to bundle what they said were legitimate versions of Windows with a new laptop, either for free or the equivalent of about $30.Microsoft began lobbying Lenovo in 2004 to stop shipping naked PCs, but the Chinese firm countered that its margins were too low, a person familiar with the negotiations said. Two years later - just days before then-President Hu Jintao visited Gates' U.S. home - China announced a new law requiring PCs to be shipped with operating systems. That merely dented piracy rates, which fell to 79 percent in 2009 from 92 percent in 2004, according to the BSA.Lenovo said it reached an agreement with Microsoft in June of this year to ensure that Lenovo PCs sold in China would come pre-installed with a genuine Windows operating system. ""MOBILE ALSO-RAN"" Microsoft's new approach is to push the price of Windows low enough to make it worth a PC maker's while. The cost of a Windows license has fallen to below $50 from as high as $150, said IDC's Andi, taking Microsoft down to ""levels where they've never competed before.""Microsoft's Pickup said it was too early to gauge take-up.In any case, making Windows cheaper for PCs is just part of a broader response to deeper shifts in the industry. The rise of mobile, tablets, cloud-based services and free operating systems has marginalized Microsoft and challenged its business model.While Windows is on more than 90 percent of traditional computers - according to data compiled by analyst Ben Bajarin - that figure drops to below 14 percent once mobile devices such as phones and tablets are factored in, estimates Gartner. More than half those devices run Google's Android mobile OS, which is effectively free to handset and tablet makers. Apple, a key player in all types of devices, gives away upgrades to its operating systems for free.Pickup says Microsoft has listened to phone makers' complaints and relaxed what hardware they need to install the mobile version of Windows. It has also made the operating system free on any mobile device of 9 inches or less.Taken together, the moves are ""about bringing down the cost as more and more of the populations in these emerging markets are having their first computing experience,"" Pickup said.These are significant concessions, analysts say, but Microsoft will have to learn to be a bit player, where its software and services run on other people's operating systems.""The biggest threat to Microsoft,"" Dawson said, ""is the shift from a PC-based world where Microsoft dominated to a mobile world where Microsoft is an also-ran.""(This story has been refiled to correct Wang affiliation in paragraph 19) (Additional reporting by Noel Randewich in SAN FRANCISCO and Bill Rigby in SEATTLE; Editing by Ian Geoghegan)",2014-08-12,MSFT,"Tue Aug 12, 2014 | 3:16am EDT",'Naked PCs' lay bare Microsoft's emerging markets problem,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-microsoft-emergingmarkets-idUSKBN0GA0V120140812?type=companyNews,0.9963,0.045,0.872,0.084

384,"  (Recasts, adds details)BEIJING Aug 13 A Chinese academic who sat on a government anti-monopoly advisory committee has been sacked, official news agency Xinhua reported on Wednesday, saying he had taken payments from U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.Xinhua said Zhang Xinzhu, a member of the top government think-tank the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the cabinet's anti-monopoly experts committee, took ""huge rewards"" from Qualcomm, itself the subject of an antitrust investigation.An array of industries has come under the spotlight as China intensifies efforts to bring companies into compliance with an anti-monopoly law enacted in 2008.Calls and emails to Qualcomm's media relations department in Beijing seeking comment went unanswered. There was no immediate response to emails requesting comment sent to the company's U.S. headquarters in San Diego.In a short, emailed response to questions from Reuters, Zhang wrote: ""(My) individual strength is too insignificant, and the machine of state too powerful. There can only be silence"".Xinhua is the state news agency. Official announcements are sometimes made via Xinhua, rather than government departments. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), one of China's antitrust regulators, is investigating Qualcomm's local subsidiary.The NDRC said in February the chipmaker was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, allegations which could see it hit with record fines of more than $1 billion.Xinhua said ""certain multinational companies"" had been attempting to delay such probes into them, including spending money to gain support on experts groups and complaining of being picked on for being foreign.""Against this backdrop, hiring relevant 'experts' from government departments to 'speak on behalf of foreign companies' is a violation of discipline ...

""Inspections must not prejudge the outcome of the investigation and full rights of defence must be afforded to the companies in question. Disconcertingly, the European Chamber is not convinced that this has systematically been the case in China's recent investigations,"" it said in a statement.""The European Chamber has received numerous alarming anecdotal accounts from a number of sectors that administrative intimidation tactics are being used to impel companies to accept punishments and remedies without full hearings,"" it said.""Practices such as informing companies not to challenge the investigations, bring lawyers to hearings or involve their respective governments or chambers of commerce are contrary to best practices,"" it said. European business are also increasingly wondering whether foreign companies are being disproportionately targeted, said the chamber, which has more than 1,800 member companies in China.""In some of the industries under investigation, domestic companies have not been targeted for similar violations.

387,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Former Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has left the software company's board in order to spend more time on his newly acquired Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, but said he plans to hang on to his 4 percent stake in Microsoft.""I see a combination of the Clippers, civic contribution, teaching and study taking a lot of time,"" Ballmer said in a letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made public by Microsoft on Tuesday. ""The fall will be hectic between teaching a new class and the start of the NBA season so my departure from the board is effective immediately,"" he wrote.Ballmer, 58, paid an NBA-record $2 billion for the Clippers. On Monday he greeted several thousand fans gathered at the team's Staples Center home with the trademark screams that punctuated employee meetings at Microsoft.His exit marks the end of a 34-year association with the company that led the personal computer revolution. Ballmer joined Bill Gates' firm in 1980 when it was just a small startup in the Seattle suburbs, and succeeded him as CEO from 2000 until this February. His decision to step down from the board is not surprising after 12 months of change at the head of the 39-year old software giant. It avoids potential board tension between Microsoft's new leader and the old regime, as Nadella attempts to move the company away from its traditional PC-focused mindset toward mobile computing.""It removes the final 'Ballmer overhang' at Microsoft,"" said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives of Ballmer's exit. ""His resignation from the board represents a positive, as it leaves the company with a clean sheet of paper."" A year ago this week Ballmer announced his plan to retire from Microsoft, amid discontent over his leadership fueled by activist shareholder ValueAct Capital.That caused five months of uncertainty at the top of Microsoft until Feb. 4, when veteran insider Nadella was appointed CEO and co-founder Gates stepped down as chairman.As Gates sells shares to fund his philanthropy, Ballmer has become the biggest individual shareholder in Microsoft, owning a 4 percent stake worth about $15 billion.  ""I hold more Microsoft shares than anyone other than index funds and love the mix of profits, investments and dividends returned in our stock,"" Ballmer said in his letter to Nadella. ""I expect to continue holding that position for the foreseeable future.""Microsoft shares closed up 50 cents at $45.33 on Nasdaq.

A multi-billion dollar fund Intellectual Ventures launched in 2008 generated returns of 2.5 percent for investors through the end of 2012.

389,"  (Adds analyst comment; recasts to add reference to retaining Microsoft stake)By Bill RigbySEATTLE Aug 19 Former Microsoft Corp  Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has left the software company's board in order to spend more time on his newly acquired Los Angeles Clippers basketball team, but said he plans to hang on to his 4 percent stake in Microsoft.""I see a combination of the Clippers, civic contribution, teaching and study taking a lot of time,"" Ballmer said in a letter to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made public by Microsoft on Tuesday.""The fall will be hectic between teaching a new class and the start of the NBA season so my departure from the board is effective immediately,"" he wrote. Ballmer, 58, paid an NBA-record $2 billion for the Clippers. On Monday he greeted several thousand fans gathered at the team's Staples Center home with the trademark screams that punctuated employee meetings at Microsoft.His exit marks the end of a 34-year association with the company that led the personal computer revolution. Ballmer joined Bill Gates' firm in 1980 when it was just a small startup in the Seattle suburbs, and succeeded him as CEO from 2000 until this February.His decision to step down from the board is not surprising after 12 months of change at the head of the 39-year old software giant. It avoids potential board tension between Microsoft's new leader and the old regime, as Nadella attempts to move the company away from its traditional PC-focused mindset toward mobile computing. ""It removes the final 'Ballmer overhang' at Microsoft,"" said FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives of Ballmer's exit. ""His resignation from the board represents a positive, as it leaves the company with a clean sheet of paper.""A year ago this week Ballmer announced his plan to retire from Microsoft, amid discontent over his leadership fueled by activist shareholder ValueAct Capital. That caused five months of uncertainty at the top of Microsoft until Feb. 4, when veteran insider Nadella was appointed CEO and co-founder Gates stepped down as chairman.As Gates sells shares to fund his philanthropy, Ballmer has become the biggest individual shareholder in Microsoft, owning a 4 percent stake worth about $15 billion.""I hold more Microsoft shares than anyone other than index funds and love the mix of profits, investments and dividends returned in our stock,"" Ballmer said in his letter to Nadella. ""I expect to continue holding that position for the foreseeable future.""Microsoft shares closed up 50 cents at $45.33 on Nasdaq. They are up 40 percent since Ballmer said he planned to retire, and are trading at levels not seen since the tech stock boom of 2000.

393,"   By Eric Kelsey | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES With his trademark top-of-the-lungs, high-fiving, rambunctious enthusiasm, former Microsoft Corp chief executive Steve Ballmer introduced himself to Los Angeles Clippers fans on Monday, promising a new era for the NBA team after former owner Donald Sterling was banned for life over racist remarks.Ballmer, 58, who paid an NBA-record $2 billion for the Clippers, greeted the several thousand gathered at the team's Staples Center home with the primal screams that punctuated meetings at the Seattle technology company.""I couldn't be more honored or excited or fired up to be here,"" Ballmer exclaimed as he was welcomed with a standing ovation.Ballmer, who said he will be a courtside fixture at games, took over the Clippers last week, ending Sterling's 33 years of ownership that were marked by decades of losing and second-tier status to local rival, the Lakers.The NBA banned Sterling for life in April, days after his privately taped remarks imploring a girlfriend not to publicly associate with black people were published.The remarks, which were publicized during the Clippers' playoff run, sparked public outrage, prompted sponsors to cut ties with the team and caused Clippers players, who are mostly black, to consider a boycott.The 80-year-old real estate billionaire also unsuccessfully fought in court to keep the team after his estranged wife, Shelly Sterling, struck the deal with Ballmer. ""Everything is about looking forward,"" Ballmer told the crowd, striking a tone about new beginnings for a team that finds itself for the first time as a playoff contender behind superstars Chris Paul and Blake Griffin.'A GREAT CHANGE'  The playoffs came after the Clippers acquired top players in recent years. Now they are also in a new position of commanding the off-season spotlight.""We made lemonade out of lemons,"" Ballmer said alongside eight of the team's players who were in attendance, praising their performance last year during the Sterling saga.Sterling's comments embarrassed the NBA and Clippers supporters.""I think it's going to be a great change, a positive change,"" said Clippers fan Teri Renty. ""It's something we desperately needed, and it will really be great for the team in giving them the energy and the momentum to look forward to good things."" The rally served as a restart for fans who were given t-shirts in Clippers red, white and blue that read ""We are Clipper Nation"" along with ""It's a New Day"" on the back.Head coach Doc Rivers, who considered quitting if Sterling remained as owner, characterized the Ballmer era as one of relief for fans, who had for years been publicly reserved in their support for the longtime Western Conference doormats.""Now they can actually say it and be proud of it, and I'm very happy for them,"" Rivers told reporters after the rally.""If we do it right, the name can stand for something.""

Opera shares surged after the deal was announced on Thursday and at 1410 GMT they were trading up 10 percent, giving the firm a market capitalisation of $1.8 billion.Opera, which also generates revenues from digital advertising platforms, said the deal would be profitable from day one. It declined to estimate the expected volume, but a source close to the agreement said Opera Mini could now be installed on an additional 100 million handsets a year. Opera also raised its full-year guidance, predicting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation would be $117 million to $124 million, up from previous guidance of $110-120 million, while revenues would come in at $480-500 million versus a previous forecast of $435-460 million. Norway's Opera said Microsoft would automatically put the Opera Mini browser, known for its ability to compress content and save on data charges, on its feature phones -- mobile phones with more limited capacity than so-called smartphones.Opera said Microsoft was essentially outsourcing web browser development for all phones that do not use its Windows operating system. Opera Mini will also be pushed out to existing phones to encourage uses to upgrade from the Xpress browser. ""The deal involves feature phones and the Asha product line, which is good, but there is a potential kicker here if they manage to convert existing users, like they say they will,"" Christer Roth an analyst at DNB Markets said. ""If they succeed then it would give them a solid user base growth, which they indirectly can monetize,"" Roth said.

402,"  (Adds Qualcomm comment)BEIJING Aug 22 U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc  is seeking to end an investigation by China's pricing regulator into monopoly practices, the company said on Friday, expressing its willingness to improve and correct pricing issues according to the regulator.The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), in a statement on its website, said its officials had met on Thursday with a delegation from Qualcomm which included company President Derek Aberle.""Qualcomm executives discussed with NDRC officials several topics in an effort to reach a comprehensive resolution,"" the company said in an e-mailed statement. ""We are continuing to cooperate with NDRC and cannot comment further."" The NDRC gave no further details. The regulator is investigating Qualcomm's local subsidiary after it said in February the U.S. chipmaker was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, allegations which could see it hit with record fines of more than $1 billion.Last month, a state-run newspaper said the NDRC had determined that Qualcomm had a monopoly but did not say whether the regulator had determined that the company had abused this monopoly. Qualcomm is one of the world's biggest mobile chipmakers. Qualcomm is one of at least 30 foreign firms to come under scrutiny as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law which some critics say is being used to unfairly target overseas businesses, raising protectionism concerns.Companies being investigated for anti-trust issues include Microsoft Corp and automaker Volkswagen AG. This week, the NDRC slapped a record $201 million fine on 12 Japanese automakers it said had engaged in price manipulation.

403,"  SHANGHAI China could have a new homegrown operating system by October to take on imported rivals such as Microsoft Corp, Google Inc and Apple Inc, Xinhua news agency said on Sunday.Computer technology became an area of tension between China and the United States after a number of run-ins over cyber security. China is now looking to help its domestic industry catch up with imported systems such as Microsoft's Windows and Google's mobile operating system Android.The operating system would first appear on desktop devices and later extend to smartphone and other mobile devices, Xinhua said, citing Ni Guangnan who heads an official OS development alliance established in March.Ni's comments were originally reported by the People's Post and Telecommunications News, an official trade paper run by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).""We hope to launch a Chinese-made desktop operating system by October supporting app stores,"" Ni told the trade paper. Some Chinese OS already existed, but there was a large gap between China's technology and that of developed countries, he added. He said he hoped domestically built software would be able to replace desktop operating systems within one to two years and mobile operating systems within three to five years.In May, China banned government use of Windows 8, Microsoft's latest operating system, a blow to the U.S. technology firm's business which raised fears China was moving to protect domestic firms.

404,"  SHANGHAI Aug 24 China could have a new homegrown operating system by October to take on imported rivals such as Microsoft Corp, Google Inc and Apple Inc, Xinhua news agency said on Sunday.Computer technology became an area of tension between China and the United States after a number of run-ins over cyber security. China is now looking to help its domestic industry catch up with imported systems such as Microsoft's Windows and Google's mobile operating system Android.The operating system would first appear on desktop devices and later extend to smartphone and other mobile devices, Xinhua said, citing Ni Guangnan who heads an official OS development alliance established in March.Ni's comments were originally reported by the People's Post and Telecommunications News, an official trade paper run by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT).""We hope to launch a Chinese-made desktop operating system by October supporting app stores,"" Ni told the trade paper. Some Chinese OS already existed, but there was a large gap between China's technology and that of developed countries, he added. He said he hoped domestically built software would be able to replace desktop operating systems within one to two years and mobile operating systems within three to five years.In May, China banned government use of Windows 8, Microsoft's latest operating system, a blow to the U.S. technology firm's business which raised fears China was moving to protect domestic firms. Microsoft is also under investigation for anti-trust violations.

405,"  (Corrects second paragraph to say Microsoft suspected of not being fully transparent about information)* Govt official says web browser and media player probed* Microsoft has been cooperating with investigation* Microsoft antitrust probe one of nine initiated this year by SAICBy Gerry Shih and Paul CarstenBEIJING, Aug 26 Microsoft Corp's  Windows web browser and media player are being targeted in a Chinese antitrust probe, raising the prospect of China revisiting the software bundling issue at the heart of past antitrust complaints against the firm in the West.The State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) suspects Microsoft of not being fully transparent with information about its Windows and Office sales, but the company has expressed willingness to cooperate with ongoing investigations, Zhang Mao, the head of the antitrust regulator, told reporters at a briefing in Beijing on Tuesday. As Windows became the world's dominant operating system in the 1990s and 2000s, the issue of how Microsoft bundled its web browser and media player became the focus of respective antitrust cases brought by U.S. and European authorities.Microsoft settled in 2001 with the U.S. Department of Justice a long-running case centring around whether it could bundle its flagship Internet Explorer browser with Windows.In 2004, the European Union ordered Microsoft to pay a 497 million euro ($656 million) fine and produce a version of Windows without the Windows Media Player bundled. The fine was later increased to nearly 1.4 billion euros. China's focus on two products previously litigated elsewhere appears to form the basis of its investigation, but the probe could extend beyond the media player and browser bundling issue, said You Youting, a partner at Shanghai Debund Law Offices.""It's possible the government hasn't been successful in finding what they're looking for,"" You said. ""But by starting with these two products, it gives them time.""A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment when contacted by telephone. The Microsoft investigation comes amid a spate of antitrust probes against foreign firms in China, including mobile chipset maker Qualcomm Inc and German car maker Daimler AG's  luxury auto unit Mercedes-Benz. The probes have renewed fears of Chinese protectionism.The SAIC said earlier this month that Microsoft had been suspected of violating China's anti-monopoly law since June last year in relation to problems with compatibility, bundling and document authentication for its Windows operating system and Microsoft Office software.The SAIC, one of China's three anti-monopoly regulators, formally announced its investigation into Microsoft's activities this month after officials raided Microsoft offices in several major cities and met Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Mary Snapp for questioning in Beijing.""The investigation is presently ongoing, and we will disclose the results to the public in a timely fashion,"" Zhang said, adding that the probe is one of nine opened this year which include the software, tobacco, telecommunications, insurance, tourism and utilities sectors.The companies involved in the nine investigations comprise domestic, foreign, state-owned enterprises and trade associations, Zhang said.

410,"   By Gerry Shih and Paul Carsten | BEIJING/SEATTLE  BEIJING/SEATTLE Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella is set to visit China in late September, the company said on Thursday, as the Chinese government conducts an antitrust investigation into the world's largest software company. It is not clear if Nadella, who took over as Microsoft CEO in February, will meet with any Chinese government representatives as part of his visit, or try to resolve issues with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC), one of China's antitrust regulators. SAIC officials could not be reached for comment. Microsoft, which normally does not comment on executive travel plans, acknowledged the trip but tried to defuse any tension around the antitrust issue.""Satya's trip was planned before the Chinese government investigation began,"" said a company spokesperson. ""We're committed to complying with China's laws and addressing SAIC's questions and concerns.""  Microsoft is one of many foreign firms to have come under scrutiny as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law, which some critics say is being used to unfairly target overseas businesses.Foreign CEOs often pay calls on the world's second-largest economy to strengthen business and political ties. Nadella would be at least the second major tech executive to have visited the country as antitrust tensions simmer.Qualcomm Inc President Derek Aberle, looking to end to the wireless chip giant's own antitrust scrutiny, met with China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) last week.  Nadella's predecessor, Steve Ballmer, visited China four times in the past five fiscal years, Microsoft said. It is not clear that Microsoft achieved much with such high-level executive appearances in a country where Windows and Office are widely pirated. Ballmer said in 2011 that Microsoft got more revenue in the Netherlands than China. Microsoft Deputy General Counsel Mary Snapp already met with SAIC officials in Beijing earlier this month to discuss the antitrust matter.Despite the rampant Windows piracy, China's SAIC initiated an antitrust probe into Microsoft earlier this month, saying that the company may have broken anti-monopoly laws regarding compatibility, bundling and document authentication for its Windows operating system and Office suite of applications. On Tuesday, SAIC head Zhang Mao said at a briefing in Beijing his organization - one of three antitrust regulators in China - was focusing on Microsoft's web browser and media player, and suspected the company had not been fully transparent with information about its Windows and Office sales. The investigation has been met with puzzlement outside China, given that Microsoft settled U.S. and European antitrust cases around Windows more than a decade ago, and its desktop software monopoly is now largely irrelevant with the explosion of tablets and phones running Apple Inc or Google Inc software.  The probe comes amid a spate of antitrust probes against foreign firms in China, including Qualcomm and German car maker Daimler AG's luxury auto unit Mercedes-Benz, renewing fears of Chinese protectionism.

420,"   By Michael Martina | BEIJING  BEIJING Foreign companies are increasingly concerned they are being targeted by Chinese regulators, a U.S. business lobby said on Tuesday, as a Chinese antitrust agency defended probes into firms such as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O). The American Chamber of Commerce in China is the latest business lobby to air its grievances over a series of investigations scrutinizing at least 30 foreign firms, as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law.There are growing perceptions that multinational firms are under ""selective and subjective enforcement"" using ""legal and extra-legal approaches"", the Chamber said in a report.A survey of 164 members showed 49 percent of respondents felt foreign companies were being singled out in recent pricing and anti-corruption campaigns, compared to 40 percent in a late 2013 survey of 365 members. Twenty-five percent said they were uncertain, or did not know, and 26 percent said no.Chamber Vice Chairman Lester Ross told reporters the major expansion of enforcement was welcome in principle, but regulators were using ""extra-legal"" means to conduct investigations.""They have taken what are, in many instances, vague or unspecified provisions in the law and moved to enforce them, and  sought to enforce those means through processes that do not respect the notion of due process or fairness,"" Ross said.Sixty percent of respondents in the survey also reported they felt foreign business was becoming less welcome in China. ""TRANSPARENT AND JUST""  In an April letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Washington to get tough with Beijing on its use of anti-competition rules, which it said had been seized by China to advance industrial policies that nurture domestic companies.The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China in August expressed its concern over the antitrust investigations, saying China was using strong-arm tactics and appeared to be unfairly targeting foreign firms.Xu Kunlin, director general of price supervision and the anti-monopoly bureau at the National Development Reform Commission (NDRC), reiterated that local and foreign companies were being treated equally by the agency. ""Such accusations are groundless and baseless,"" Xu told the official China Daily newspaper.""Some of the NDRC monopoly investigations involve overseas multinationals, but that does not mean that we are targeting them,"" Xu said in an interview with the paper. ""Some business operators in China have failed to adjust their practices in accordance with the anti-monopoly law,"" he added. ""Others have a clear understanding of the laws, but they take the chance that they may escape punishment."" Xu said the NDRC, one of China's three antitrust regulators, was also handling cases involving state-owned firms and Chinese private sector companies. The automotive industry has been in focus for the last two or three years, Xu said. Last month, the NDRC slapped a record fine of $201 million on 12 Japanese automakers it said had engaged in price manipulation.The NDRC is investigating Qualcomm's local subsidiary after it said in February that the company was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, accusations that could lead to record fines of more than $1 billion.Another antitrust regulator, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said on Monday it had given Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) 20 days to reply to queries on the compatibility of its Windows operating system and Office software suite amid its probe into the world's largest software company.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang responded to a question on the chamber's paper at a regular press briefing, saying he hoped foreign companies ""will abide by Chinese law"".""Anti-monopoly is to protect consumers' rights and to create a more open, fair and impartial market environment,"" Qin said. ""It is transparent and just.""

421,"  SHANGHAI, Sept 2 China's latest antitrust probes, which have hit firms such as Microsoft and Volkswagen AG, are not protectionist tools that favour domestic firms, an official of the country's price regulator told the official China Daily.In an interview, Xu Kunlin, director general of price supervision and the anti-monopoly bureau at the National Development Reform Commission, reiterated that the agency was giving equal treatment to local and foreign companies.The probes, which have scrutinized at least 30 foreign firms so far as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law, have worried U.S. companies enough to appeal to Washington, while the European Union Chamber of Commerce said last month they appeared to be unfairly targeting foreign firms.

""In effect, defendant has turned the entirety of the world's online images into little more than a vast, unlicensed 'clip art' collection for the benefit of those website publishers who implement the Bing Image Widget, all without seeking permission from the owners of copyrights in those images,"" the lawsuit said.Getty, which produces and distributes photos, video, music and multi-media products, is asking a judge in U.S. District Court to block the widget immediately and award an unspecified amount of damages. The actual injury to Getty is ""incalculable,"" according to the lawsuit. In a statement, a Microsoft spokeswoman said the company would consider whether Getty's claims had merit. ""As a copyright owner ourselves we think the laws in this area are important,"" the spokeswoman said in an email. ""We'll take a close look at Getty's concerns.""The widget is already in use by websites around the world, the lawsuit said. Getty owns or represents more than 80 million unique digital images, according to the lawsuit.The case is Getty Images Inc v. Microsoft Corp, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 14-7114.

429,"  * Google case started with EU investigation in late 2010* EU's Almunia has 2 months to decide before leaving office* Deal will only escalate market abuse, Google rival saysBy Foo Yun CheeBRUSSELS, Sept 4 Microsoft and publishers across Europe attacked Google's antitrust deal with EU regulators, calling it a ""catastrophic"" proposal that would serve only to entrench its dominance of the online search market. European Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia is preparing to decide on the case after spending three years examining whether Google squeezes out rival services in online search results.The 66-year-old Spaniard, who reached a preliminary deal with the world's most popular Internet search engine in February, has around two months to issue the final decision before he leaves office. He has told 18 complainants that he intends to rebuff their grievances and is now examining their responses.The case has become highly politicised, with sources saying about a third of Almunia's colleagues in the Commission are opposed to the deal. Sources told Reuters the EU may close the current case and open another one into Google's Android mobile operating system. The head of British price-comparison site Foundem, Shivaun Raff, said the Commission had no evidence that Google's offer to let three rivals display their logos and web links in a box and allow content providers to decide what material Google can use for its own services would resolve competition issues.""(Google's proposals) are not a remedy. They are a catastrophic escalation of the abuse,"" Raff told a news conference. Microsoft's director of competition law, Jean-Yves Art, said the U.S. software company was particularly concerned about Google's contractual curbs on advertisers making it difficult for them to switch to other online platforms.""The proposals don't cure or eliminate all restrictions that we and rivals see. There are still restrictions preventing them from providing interoperability,"" he said at the news conference.Representatives from newspapers and magazine publishers across Europe, online travel site Expedia and a host of complainants from Germany and Britain were also present at the event.Almunia's spokesman Antoine Colombani declined to comment. Google spokesman Al Verney did not immediately reply to emails and telephone calls.

435,"   By Sharon Begley | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Microsoft Corp co-founder Paul Allen's charitable foundation on Thursday will announce it is donating $9 million to support U.S. efforts to fight the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, a source familiar with the matter said.The gift to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) comes at a time when international groups, including Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization, have said resources to contain the epidemic and treat those affected are falling tragically short.Allen said the donation from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation will help CDC establish emergency operations centers in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where the worst Ebola outbreak on record has killed about 2,300 people and shows no sign of slowing six months after it began.""The tragedy of Ebola is that we know how to tackle the disease, but the governments in West Africa are in dire need of more resources and solutions,"" Allen wrote in an essay scheduled to be posted on his blog. ""The developed world needs to step up now with resources and solutions.""Last month, Allen's foundation donated $2.8 million to the American Red Cross for its work on the outbreak. On Wednesday, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation pledged $50 million to United Nations agencies and other international groups to purchase supplies, such as protective gear for healthcare workers treating Ebola patients, and to expand the emergency response. U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress for $88 million in new Ebola funding, including $25 million for CDC, but this week congressional leaders said they would provide no more than $40 million.Allen said his foundation's gift would help CDC establish and equip emergency operations centers in the three most-affected countries, focusing on public health, not patient care. The centers will use ""data management and communication systems for disease and patient contact tracing, to detect and stop the disease from spreading,"" Allen wrote. They will also expand lab testing to identify new outbreaks, and disseminate information about the epidemic to the public.""A winnable battle should never be lost,"" Allen wrote.CDC has just over 100 public health experts in the Ebola zone, and plans to send more. ""Ebola is raging through parts of West Africa like an out-of-control forest fire but it can be controlled if the world comes together,"" CDC Director Dr. Tom Frieden said in a statement issued by the foundation.The CDC Foundation, which was established by Congress in 1994 to raise funding to augment what CDC gets from Congress, recently committed $1 million to the Ebola response, including money for computers, personal protective equipment and thermal scanning thermometers for airport screeners, and training for healthcare workers.Since resigning from Microsoft in 1983, Allen has become a prominent philanthropist, supporting scientific research through the Allen Institute for Brain Science and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. He also owns the Seattle Seahawks football team and the Portland Trail Blazers basketball team.

436,"   By Paul Carsten | TIANJIN, CHINA Sept 12  TIANJIN, CHINA Sept 12 The sheer size of the Chinese market is so alluring to Western companies that even pro-internet freedom firms like CloudFlare may have to put moral outrage to the side in their pursuit of new business.San Francisco-based CloudFlare has a policy of providing cyber-defence services for all, based on a belief that the internet should be free, decentralised and open.Its clients have included groups that the U.S. government regards as terrorist organisations. Those values may now have to be shelved when it comes to entering China, where state control of the internet is among the world's tightest.CloudFlare is looking for a Chinese partner and aims to be in the country by 2015, said co-founder Michelle Zatlyn on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum meeting in the northern city of Tianjin this week. ""As we think about international expansion it's vital that we get China,"" said Zatlyn of CloudFlare's second-largest market by user traffic. ""There are rules and regulation which operate within the country. As a U.S. company we absolutely have to follow those, and we're okay with that.""The operating environment in China may be even tougher now. U.S. businesses have complained about Chinese protectionism, and American tech firms have repeatedly come under fire from the state since last year's U.S. National Security Agency cyber espionage revelations. Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc are being investigated for anti-trust violations, while IBM Corp, Intel Corp and Cisco Systems Inc have seen sales in China plummet in recent quarters.CloudFlare is joining a long list of companies, from firms that have seen little or no success in China like Yahoo Inc , eBay Inc, Google Inc and Facebook Inc  to recent entrants like LinkedIn Corp, for whom China's pull as the world's largest internet market by population has been too strong to resist. CloudFlare is hoping to learn from the lessons of the U.S. tech sector's fallen soldiers in China. One of these came at the World Economic Forum, where Lu Wei, the director of China's State Internet Information Office, said Facebook will be unable to access China any time soon, according to state media.""You have to play a slightly long game if you're a Western multi-national company in China,"" said Mark Spelman, a managing director at Accenture PLC.""It's very important to think about which Chinese partners you should be working with, and organisations need to think very  carefully about what business model you need in China - it might not be the same as in other countries,"" he cautioned.

Financially conservative Microsoft has said it prefers to keep dividend increases in line with operating profit, which grew 4 percent last fiscal year. However, Chief financial Officer Amy Hood held out the possibility of more shareholder-friendly moves, saying that Microsoft's board ""continues to evaluate capital strategy options,"" without saying what that might entail.

It did not increase the dividend in recession-hit 2009, when it laid off more than 5,000 employees. The company's shares rose slightly in after-hours trading to $46.85. Microsoft's new annual dividend would equal about 2.6 percent of that share price, the same as Intel Corp's (INTC.O) 2.6 percent but higher than Apple's 1.8 percent.

447,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will close its Silicon Valley research-and-development operation as part of 2,100 layoffs announced on Thursday, as it moves toward its new CEO's goal of cutting 18,000 staff, or about 14 percent of its workforce.News of the closure of the Microsoft Research lab at the company's campus in Mountain View, California, was first made public on Twitter by employees. The company later confirmed the move and said it would involve the loss of 50 jobs.  A spokesman said Microsoft Research, which has over 1,000 scientists and engineers worldwide working on new product ideas, will consolidate its U.S. work at Microsoft's main campus in Redmond, Washington, and in offices in New York and Boston.  After the cuts, Microsoft said it will still have 2,500 employees at its Mountain View campus, not far from rival Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) Microsoft is cutting 160 jobs in California on Thursday, and another 747 in the Seattle area, a spokesman said, as part of a total of 2,100 layoffs around the world.  This is the second wave of cuts after it laid off 13,000 in July, which marked the start of Chief Executive Satya Nadella's plan to lay off 18,000 people overall.

463,"   By Mary Milliken and Eric Kelsey | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES After Steve Ballmer plunked down $2 billion for the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers, fans might expect the former Microsoft chief executive to be hitting the reset button on a team that has been through a nasty public fight over racism.Don't bet on it. That experience, Ballmer knows, makes his team unique, and it will be part of the story he tells to earn one thing that was not guaranteed by the record price tag: a fan base that will sustain the team for years to come.""I think people understand we are a different kind of team,"" Ballmer told Reuters on Wednesday, sitting on the Clippers practice court.""We are born in a funny way, and the guys have all had to live through something not only on the court but off the court together that requires a deeper kind of commitment.""What they endured was former owner Donald Sterling's published racist comments and his refusal to sell the team after being banned for life by the NBA. With Ballmer securing the team through a deal with Sterling's estranged wife, the Clippers now open their next season on Oct. 30. Ballmer says he is pleased with the basketball side of his new venture, his first after 34 years working at Microsoft Corp, from the very beginning with friend and co-founder Bill Gates. He has signed Coach Doc Rivers for another five years, and has star players Chris Paul and Blake Griffin anchoring one of the league's strongest teams.But the man who helped sell personal computing to the masses knows he has to sell a team that has long been overlooked and overshadowed by its more famous L.A. rival, the Lakers.  Ballmer, 58, is a renowned salesman, carrying intense kinetic energy in his hulking frame as he strides across the court. He relentlessly talks about ""the fan experience"" and says he's not competing against the Lakers, but against the 29 other NBA teams.""Engaged fans actually help the team, team gets better, fan experience gets better, fans get more enthusiastic,"" he said. ""It's like voom, a perpetual motion machine.""DITCH THE IPADS  Ballmer promises that whether the fan comes to the arena, or cheers from the couch, or follows on a smartphone or tablet ""you are going to have the best experience and that is not just the best in L.A.""The mobile experience is something Ballmer knows intimately and he acknowledges that under his leadership at Microsoft it was something he did not get right. Competitors such as Apple Inc< AAPL.O> and Google Inc seized the mobile revolution and put pressure on Ballmer to innovate. He stepped down as CEO in February after 14 years.""And do I wish a higher percentage of today's mobile devices were ours and we had birthed that category?,"" he mused. ""Yes, of course I do."" Ballmer left the board of Microsoft last month but is still the largest individual shareholder, with about 4 percent of the company worth $15.7 billion.It should come as no surprise, then, that the Clippers will be a Microsoft organization. The son of a Ford Motor Co manager, he's always been a company and product loyalist, banning his own family from using Apple's iPhones.""Most of the Clippers are on Windows, some of the players and coaches are not,"" Ballmer said.""And Doc kind of knows that’s a project. It's one of the first things he said to me: 'We are probably going to get rid of these iPads, aren’t we?' And I said, 'Yeah, we probably are.' But I promised we would do it during the off season.""(This story has been refiled to correct typo in 15th paragraph) (Editing by Ken Wills)",2014-09-25,MSFT,"Thu Sep 25, 2014 | 2:11pm EDT","At L.A.

Whetstone also defended Google's practice of ranking search results, denying that it was the ""gatekeeper to the Web, as some claim.""Earlier this month, News Corp Chief Executive Robert Thomson wrote a letter to Joaquín Almunia, the European Commissioner for Competition, urging the commission to reconsider a settlement with Google over its search practices. Thomson said Google was ""willing to exploit its dominant market position to stifle competition.""

That experience, Ballmer knows, makes his team unique, and it will be part of the story he tells to earn one thing that was not guaranteed by the record price tag: a fan base that will sustain the team for years to come.""I think people understand we are a different kind of team,"" Ballmer told Reuters on Wednesday, sitting on the Clippers practice court.""We are born in a funny way, and the guys have all had to live through something not only on the court but off the court together that requires a deeper kind of commitment.""What they endured was former owner Donald Sterling's published racist comments and his refusal to sell the team after being banned for life by the NBA. With Ballmer securing the team through a deal with Sterling's estranged wife, the Clippers now open their next season on Oct. 30. Ballmer says he is pleased with the basketball side of his new venture, his first after 34 years working at Microsoft Corp , from the very beginning with friend and co-founder Bill Gates. He has signed Coach Doc Rivers for another five years, and has star players Chris Paul and Blake Griffin anchoring one of the league's strongest teams.But the man who helped sell personal computing to the masses knows he has to sell a team that has long been overlooked and overshadowed by its more famous L.A. rival, the Lakers.Ballmer, 58, is a renowned salesman, carrying intense kinetic energy in his hulking frame as he strides across the court. He relentlessly talks about ""the fan experience"" and says he's not competing against the Lakers, but against the 29 other NBA teams.""Engaged fans actually help the team, team gets better, fan experience gets better, fans get more enthusiastic,"" he said. ""It's like voom, a perpetual motion machine."" DITCH THE IPADS Ballmer promises that whether the fan comes to the arena, or cheers from the couch, or follows on a smartphone or tablet ""you are going to have the best experience and that is not just the best in L.A."" The mobile experience is something Ballmer knows intimately and he acknowledges that under his leadership at Microsoft it was something he did not get right. Competitors such as Apple Inc< AAPL.O> and Google Inc seized the mobile revolution and put pressure on Ballmer to innovate. He stepped down as CEO in February after 14 years.""And do I wish a higher percentage of today's mobile devices were ours and we had birthed that category?,"" he mused. ""Yes, of course I do.""Ballmer left the board of Microsoft last month but is still the largest individual shareholder, with about 4 percent of the company worth $15.7 billion.It should come as no surprise, then, that the Clippers will be a Microsoft organization. The son of a Ford Motor Co manager, he's always been a company and product loyalist, banning his own family from using Apple's iPhones.""Most of the Clippers are on Windows, some of the players and coaches are not,"" Ballmer said.""And Doc kind of knows that's a project. It's one of the first things he said to me: 'We are probably going to get rid of these iPads, aren't we?' And I said, 'Yeah, we probably are.' But I promised we would do it during the off season.""

466,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft Corp will unveil a new name for its best-known product on Tuesday when it offers the first official glimpse of its latest Windows operating system.The project, known for the past few years as ""Threshold"" inside the software company and ""Windows 9"" outside it, will likely get an entirely new brand, or just be called Windows,  analysts said, ahead of its full release early next year.The name change is symbolic of a new direction and style for Microsoft, which is veering away from an aggressive focus on Windows and PCs, the hallmark of previous Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer. The new, quieter emphasis is on selling services across all devices and is championed by new boss Satya Nadella.The switch also represents a desire to erase the ill will generated by Windows 8, an ambitious attempt to redesign Windows with tablet users in mind, which ended up annoying and confusing the core market of customers who use mice and keyboards.""Windows 8 was not a shining moment for Microsoft,"" said Michael Silver, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner. ""Probably the biggest issue that lingers is the negative brand equity in the name.""Many users howled in protest over the death of the start-button menu and the introduction of a colorful grid of squares or tiles representing apps in what became known as the modern user interface, even though they could easily switch to a traditional desktop mode.Judging by recent leaks online, which Microsoft has not tried to discredit, the start-button menu will come back in the next Windows, with an option of tacking on tiles if preferred.  But the problem of users having to toggle between the modern interface and the old-style desktop - for instance to use the full version of Excel spreadsheet software - has yet to be solved. ""The schizophrenic behavior between the modern user interface and the Windows desktop has got to go away,"" said  David Johnson, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. ""They have to smooth that out."" Microsoft declined to comment on the new name, or what it plans to unveil on Tuesday. The Redmond, Washington-based company has said only that it will have a ""discussion"" about where Windows is headed at a stylish event space in San Francisco on Tuesday. The choice of wording and venue are key to a humbler, lower-profile Microsoft under Nadella, who is keen to rebuild respect in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley as it moves away from the PC and to play a bigger part in the mobile computing world fashioned by Apple Inc and Google Inc.Nadella's slogan is ""mobile first, cloud first,"" and although he will not be at the San Francisco event - he is traveling in Asia - that theme will be at the fore. ""This is a launching pad and catalyst for Nadella's holistic cloud vision over the coming years,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at investment bank FBR Capital Markets. ""Windows 9 is a potentially game-changing product release for Microsoft."" Nadella is resigned to the fact that sales of PCs have leveled off, and with it sales of Windows. With the explosion of smartphones and tablets, Windows now powers only 14 percent of computing devices sold last year, according to Gartner. His response is to focus on selling high-quality services - such as the Office suite of applications or storing documents in the cloud - to people on whatever device or system they are using. ""Microsoft is changing from a company that was Windows-centric to one that is services-centric,"" said Silver at Gartner. ""It has to be that way. Windows revenue is likely going to decline, and Microsoft's task is to replace that Windows revenue with revenue from services on all sorts of platforms.""The challenge is to come up with killer apps and services users can't live without. ""Microsoft built their business on being very good at delivering what people needed in the moment, for example Excel in the 1990s,"" said Johnson at Forrester. ""That's what Microsoft has to get back to, innovating and creating things that people find indispensable.""

479,"   By Bill Rigby | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Corp announced its 'Windows 10' operating system on Tuesday to replace the largely unpopular Windows 8, skipping a number to mark a leap toward unifying the way people work on tablets, phones and traditional computers.The next version of Microsoft's flagship product, which still runs the vast majority of personal computers and is used by 1.5 billion customers worldwide, is aimed at recapturing the lucrative business market, which generally ignored the new-look Windows 8.Windows 10 will be ""our greatest enterprise platform ever,"" said Terry Myerson, Microsoft's head of operating systems, at an event in San Francisco. Only 20 percent of organizations migrated to Windows 8, which was released two years ago, according to tech research firm Forrester. Many PC users disliked the touch-optimized interface and bemoaned the loss of the traditional start-button pop-up menu.He said Windows 10, long known by the project name 'Threshold' internally, represented a new type of system for the company, as it seeks to unify computing as mobile devices proliferate. The name represented that leap, he said.""Windows 10 adapts to the devices customers are using, from Xbox to PCs and phones to tablets and tiny gadgets,"" said Myerson.  Microsoft faces an uphill struggle in reigniting excitement about Windows. With the rise of Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad, and Google Inc's Android devices, Windows no longer plays a central role in many people's on-screen lives.From a virtual monopoly on personal computing 10 years ago, Windows now runs only about 14 percent of devices, according to research firm Gartner.Reaction to the news was cautious. Microsoft shares fell 8 cents to $46.36 on Nasdaq. ""It's a bold statement for Microsoft to make,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""So far there's not as much meat on the bone as we would have wanted, although it's still very early days.""  An early version of the software, demonstrated on stage by Microsoft executive Joe Belfiore, showed two modes, one optimized for touch-controlled tablets, and one for PCs using a mouse and keyboard. Users can switch between the two depending on the device. Myerson did not say exactly how or when the new Windows would be rolled out, but other executives said Microsoft was aiming for a full release in spring 2015.

480,"  (Adds analyst comment, share price)By Bill RigbySAN FRANCISCO, Sept 30 Microsoft Corp  announced its 'Windows 10' operating system on Tuesday to replace the largely unpopular Windows 8, skipping a number to mark a leap toward unifying the way people work on tablets, phones and traditional computers.The next version of Microsoft's flagship product, which still runs the vast majority of personal computers and is used by 1.5 billion customers worldwide, is aimed at recapturing the lucrative business market, which generally ignored the new-look Windows 8.Windows 10 will be ""our greatest enterprise platform ever,"" said Terry Myerson, Microsoft's head of operating systems, at an event in San Francisco. Only 20 percent of organizations migrated to Windows 8, which was released two years ago, according to tech research firm Forrester. Many PC users disliked the touch-optimized interface and bemoaned the loss of the traditional start-button pop-up menu.He said Windows 10, long known by the project name 'Threshold' internally, represented a new type of system for the company, as it seeks to unify computing as mobile devices proliferate. The name represented that leap, he said. ""Windows 10 adapts to the devices customers are using, from Xbox to PCs and phones to tablets and tiny gadgets,"" said Myerson.Microsoft faces an uphill struggle in reigniting excitement about Windows. With the rise of Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad, and Google Inc's Android devices, Windows no longer plays a central role in many people's on-screen lives.From a virtual monopoly on personal computing 10 years ago, Windows now runs only about 14 percent of devices, according to research firm Gartner. Reaction to the news was cautious. Microsoft shares fell 8 cents to $46.36 on Nasdaq. ""It's a bold statement for Microsoft to make,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""So far there's not as much meat on the bone as we would have wanted, although it's still very early days.""An early version of the software, demonstrated on stage by Microsoft executive Joe Belfiore, showed two modes, one optimized for touch-controlled tablets, and one for PCs using a mouse and keyboard. Users can switch between the two depending on the device.Myerson did not say exactly how or when the new Windows would be rolled out, but other executives said Microsoft was aiming for a full release in spring 2015. A technical preview can be downloaded from Microsoft's website, starting on Wednesday, for users to try out and give the company feedback.""They were trying to start the messaging for a product that won't actually ship until sometime around the middle of next year,"" said Gartner analyst Steve Kleynhans at the event.

481,"   By Aruna Viswanatha | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Four members of an alleged international computer hacking ring were charged with stealing more than $100 million worth of software and data - some of it used to train military pilots and some related to Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Xbox gaming console - the U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday.Two of the four - a 28-year-old New Jersey man and a 22-year-old Canadian man - pleaded guilty to charges contained in an indictment unsealed earlier in the day, the agency said.Prosecutors said the ring gained unauthorized access to the computer networks of Microsoft and some of its partners between January 2011 and March 2014 to steal source code, technical specifications and other information.Some of the intrusions were directed at the Xbox One gaming console before its November 2013 release. The hackers tried to build a counterfeit version of the console, according to the indictment.The hackers also stole information about pre-release versions of the “Gears of War 3” and “Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3” video games, prosecutors said. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft declined to comment on the case. The men were also accused of logging into a U.S. Army network to steal simulator software for the Boeing (BA.N) Apache attack helicopter, the Justice Department said. Those attacks occurred after the ring hacked into the network of Zombie Studios, a Seattle-based video game developer contracted by the Army to make the training software, according to the indictment. The men allegedly obtained access to the computer networks partly by using the stolen user names and passwords of employees at the partner firms. Sanadodeh Nesheiwat of Washington, New Jersey and David Pokora of Mississauga, Ontario pleaded guilty to charges in Delaware federal court, the Justice Department said. Nathan Leroux, 20, of Bowie, Maryland, and Austin Alcala, 18, of McCordsville, Indiana, were also charged in an 18-count superseding indictment. A fifth member of the ring who is an Australian citizen was charged under Australian law for his alleged role in the conspiracy, the agency said. Tuesday's charges marked the second big hacking case announced by the Department of Justice this year. In May, the agency charged five Chinese military officers and accused them of hacking into American nuclear, metal and solar companies to steal trade secrets.

485,"  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is demanding $6.9 million interest from Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) in a dispute over smartphone patent royalties, according to a lawsuit unsealed by a New York federal court on Friday.Microsoft is asking the court to rule that it did not breach a business collaboration agreement with Samsung, and that Samsung must pay interest on more than $1 billion in royalty payments which it delayed in protest at Microsoft's planned purchase of rival Nokia's handset business. A redacted version of the lawsuit was filed by Microsoft in August. Samsung made royalty payments on time to Microsoft during the first fiscal year after they signed their 2011 agreement, the lawsuit said.  However, after Microsoft announced the Nokia deal in September 2013, Samsung initially refused to make another payment, arguing that the Nokia deal breached its licensing agreement with Microsoft. It eventually paid late without adding interest, according to the lawsuit. Samsung did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.  Microsoft has successfully argued that Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android mobile system uses some of its technology, and as a result most hardware makers, including Samsung, have agreed to pay patent royalties on Android handsets.

491,"  * Microsoft to terminate manufacturing services starting Nov 1* Nokia says evaluating options to minimize impact on employees   (Adds Nokia statement, factory details)Oct 7 Nokia Oyj said it would suspend mobile handset production at its troubled Chennai facility in India from Nov. 1 given that the company has yet to resolve a tax dispute with the Indian government.Nokia sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft  in April, but it was forced to leave the Indian factory out of the deal due to the tax dispute with Indian authorities. It continued to operate the factory as a contract manufacturing unit for Microsoft. ""Microsoft has informed Nokia that it will be terminating the manufacturing services defined in the agreement with effect from Nov. 1. In absence of further orders from Microsoft, Nokia will suspend handset production at the Sriperumbudur facility,"" Nokia said in a statement on Tuesday. Nokia's business now includes network equipment, navigation technology and patents.The plant in Chennai was among Nokia's biggest for making handsets but has suffered after the company got caught in the tax dispute. In April Nokia introduced a voluntary retirement scheme at the factory after a review in which it considered the ""predictability and stability of the regulatory environment"" in countries where it operates. At that time the plant employed about 6,600 full-time workers.An asset freeze imposed by the tax department stops Nokia from ""exploring potential opportunities for the transfer of the factory to a successor to support the long-term viability of the established, fully functional electronics manufacturing ecosystem,"" the company said.

492,"   By Bill Rigby and Sarah McBride | SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO  SEATTLE/SAN FRANCISCO A well-known picture in tech circles, taken in 1978, shows the first 11 employees at Microsoft. Two are women. One of them left two years later after a pay dispute. Almost four decades later, the ratio has improved: About a third of Microsoft's 110,000 or so employees are women. But the company's pay practices and attitude toward women are still open to question and will likely be taken up at the board level, according to one director, Maria Klawe.The issue hit the headlines and social media on Thursday when new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella suggested women in tech shouldn't ask for pay raises but should instead trust the system and rely on ""karma"" to get what they deserve. He later said he was wrong, but the damage was done, reinforcing the view that Microsoft - and the tech industry generally - is a boys' club. ""He blew that question,"" said Klawe in a telephone interview on Friday. ""He's retracted it. I think it's going to take us all to a better place. I'm pretty sure he's going to be thinking really hard about pay equity.""It was Klawe, a longtime campaigner for women in tech, who asked Nadella the question onstage on Thursday that led to his remarks, and she has since led the company's efforts at damage limitation.Klawe, 63, said she has been pressing for hiring and promoting women at Microsoft since she joined the board five years ago, but the issue of pay raises for women had not been discussed by the board.""I suspect it might be now,"" she said. Klawe pointed to the recruitment of Peggy Johnson from Qualcomm as head of business development in September as a recent success, but she conceded there have been backward steps, notably the ousting of Tami Reller and Julie Larson-Green, who ran the flagship Windows unit until a shakeup in 2013.  ""I did feel badly that we had Tami and Julie on the executive team and then had two fewer people. But it really had to do with what made sense in terms of who was the right person for which job,"" said Klawe. ""I'm sure we'll see more women in those levels."" Reller has since left Microsoft, while Larson-Green is responsible for the overall look and feel of Microsoft's software services. BOYS' CLUB  Microsoft has never been a beacon of diversity.Karin Carter, who worked at the company in its heyday from 1983 until 1997 and went on to write a book about the experience, said there were only five or so women programmers at Microsoft when she joined, with the vast majority of women in support positions.""The first time my fellow administrative assistant and I worked all night to get materials ready for a meeting, we got roses from the vice president of the international group,"" said Carter. ""My first thought was, 'Roses? How about money?'"" Today the numbers are slightly better. Microsoft's 15-strong senior leadership team, which runs the company day to day, has three women: Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood; Lisa Brummel, head of human resources; and recent hire Johnson.Its board of 12 also has three women: former Wall Street banker Dina Dublon; Klawe, president of Harvey Mudd College; and most recently Teri List-Stoll, chief financial officer of Kraft Foods Group. But the issue of unequal pay looms large. Numbers from job site Glassdoor show that men tend to earn more doing a similar job than women at Microsoft, though the data is far from complete and based on voluntary disclosure. For example, a male Microsoft senior software development engineer makes about $137,000 per year, according to Glassdoor, compared with about $129,000 for women. Microsoft declined to comment or provide data on what it pays staff. Microsoft is not alone. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that men earn 24 percent more, on average, than women in the tech sector. In computer and mathematical occupations, men working full-time make a median average of $1,452 per week, compared with $1,174 per week for women.The pay gap, and how to close it, was brought to public attention last year by Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg in her book “Lean In.” She wrote that for women, negotiating is “like trying to cross a minefield backward in high heels.” Women who push for higher salaries are viewed as more demanding than men who do the same, she writes, and pay costs “in goodwill and future advancement.”The Microsoft furor may yet lead to improvement, said one campaigner. ""Nadella's reaction was likely based on what he thinks men do - work hard and get rewarded - rather than recognizing that what they actually do is work hard, talk about the hard work they are doing and then get rewarded,"" said Meiko Takayama, founder of Advancing Women Executives, an advocacy group.

497,"  * ChinaSoft thriving on cloud computing boost -CEO* Profit surged over 40 pct in first half* All countries want to secure vital IT sectors -CEOBy Matthew MillerBEIJING, Oct 13 Although Microsoft Corp  is among U.S. technology firms caught up in Chinese security worries and antitrust probes, a local software company in which the Seattle giant is a strategic investor is riding high on the growth of cloud computing.The chief executive of ChinaSoft International Ltd , 5 percent-owned by Microsoft, says that's more down to native firms latching on to global trends like the cloud, than Beijing policies cutting into orders from state enterprises for foreign players' goods.A leading Microsoft distributor in China, selling IT systems and outsourcing services, ChinaSoft saw first-half profit jump 43 percent to 115 million yuan ($19 million). Founded as an $81,000 start-up spun out of a government firm, Hong Kong-listed ChinaSoft is now worth more than $600 million.""The biggest change has been the arrival of the cloud, and the impact of cloud computing,"" Chen said in an interview with Reuters. China's spending on cloud services rocketed to 80.4 billion yuan ($13 billion) in 2013, according to the China Software Testing Center, and the market is expected to grow at a better than 60 percent clip over the next three years as local firms move away from storing data on in-house servers.The challenge for foreign tech firms ""hasn't been China"" per se, the CEO said, referring to a perception that China's government is unique in supporting Chinese IT companies and cloud services providers.""All countries want (to secure) their most vital sectors with their own systems,"" said Chen, whose 15 percent stake in the Beijing-based company is worth close to $100 million. ""It's the same for the United States."" STATE SPENDING Foreign companies, particularly U.S. technology firms, have come under increasing scrutiny in China as Beijing pushes hard on information security in the wake of last year's cyber espionage revelations by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden. Firms from Microsoft to IBM Corp  have seen China sales slip as state-run firms have taken their business elsewhere.Chen attributes ChinaSoft's success to serving rising demand from businesses for social, mobile, application and cloud services requested by their clients. That's taking place against a backdrop of a burgeoning domestic market, where the government is supporting the development of local software and security technology.With China's state-owned business sector marshalling a huge capital spending budget, companies local and foreign court their business. ChinaSoft, which rolled out various government platforms more than a decade ago, has long-standing relationships with many central government ministries and localities.It also counts state-owned firms like China Mobile Communications Corp, State Grid Corp of China  and China UnionPay as clients. Newly listed e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding is a strategic partner. About 50 percent of revenue is tied to state-owned firms and the government, while revenue attributed to all Microsoft products and services accounted for about 7 percent of sales in first-half 2014. Revenue attributed to Microsoft goods and services in China alone fell.Microsoft officials in the United States declined to comment for this story. The company doesn't disclose revenue figures for China, nor say if sales are rising or falling. According to one official company presentation, China revenue exceeded $1 billion in 2013.OVERSEAS AMBITIONS Since the start of the year, ChinaSoft has seen its share price gain more than 30 percent. Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng Index is off nearly 1 percent this year. It has other powerful backers besides Microsoft: Hony Capital, the private equity firm backed by Legend Holdings, now holds a leading 17.85 percent stake. Legend Holdings is the largest investor in fast-growing computer and smartphone maker Lenovo Group Ltd.Now, even as its China business grows, ChinaSoft is pressing on with international expansion and expanding outsourcing and consulting services.Last November, it spent a reported $41 million to buy-out Austin, Texas-based consultancy Catapult Systems LLC, to extend its Microsoft integration services globally. Chen said he expects international revenue to increase to 30 percent of sales within the next five years, from 20 percent last year.ChinaSoft also is growing its distribution through a joint venture with Huawei Technologies Co, the telecom equipment giant, to provide more outsourcing services, including management of Huawei's cloud-based payment system.ChinaSoft has set its sights on more than doubling its overall revenue to 10 billion yuan by 2015. Despite ChinaSoft's expanding sales, the company only achieved profit margins of 6.2 percent last year - weak for an industry where margins are usually much stronger.The rapid growth of ChinaSoft's workforce - staff has more than doubled since 2010 alone and now stands at 23,000 - and rising labor costs are part of the problem, Chen said. ""Our goal now is to get (margins) back to 10 percent"".The executive said ChinaSoft's success in building a more profitable business will depend on management discipline in competing against overseas services companies, including Accenture Plc and IBM.""We need to show our customers that we have the same service capabilities as our foreign counterparts,"" Chen said.

499,"  (Adds comments from Mozilla, Google, Microsoft, security expert)By Jim FinkleBOSTON Oct 14 Three Google Inc  researchers have uncovered a security bug in widely used web encryption technology that they say could allow hackers to take over accounts for email, banking and other services in what they have dubbed a ""Poodle"" attack.The discovery of ""Poodle,"" which stands for Padding Oracle On Downloaded Legacy Encryption, prompted makers of web browsers and server software to advise users on Tuesday to disable use of the source of the security bug: an 18-year old encryption standard known as SSL 3.0.It was the third time this year that researchers have uncovered a vulnerability in widely used web technology, following April's ""Heartbleed"" bug in OpenSSL and last month's ""Shellshock"" bug in a piece of Unix software known as Bash.Security experts said that hackers could steal browser ""cookies"" in ""Poodle"" attacks, potentially taking control of email, banking and social networking accounts. Even so, experts said the threat was not as serious as the two prior bugs.""If Shellshock and Heartbleed were Threat Level 10, then Poodle is more like a 5 or a 6,"" said Tal Klein, vice president with cloud security firm Adallom. The threat was disclosed in a research paper published on the website of the OpenSSL Project, which develops the most widely used type of SSL encryption software.Rumors of a bug in SSL software had been circulating in recent days, prompting some security professionals to prepare for a major new threat this week.Ivan Ristic, director of application security research with Qualys, said ""Poodle"" was not as serious as the previous threats because the attack was ""quite complicated,"" requiring hackers to have privileged access to networks. Jeff Moss, a cyber adviser to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, said attackers would need to launch a ""man-in-the-middle"" attack, placing themselves between victims and websites using approaches such as creating rogue WiFi ""hotspots"" in Internet cafes.Google suggested a technical workaround to secure web servers, but added on its blog that it hopes to eventually remove support for SSL 3.0 from all client software.Mozilla plans to disable SSL 3.0 by default in the next version of its Firefox browser, to be released on Nov. 25. (mzl.la/1DaxOwY). ""SSL version 3.0 is no longer secure,"" Mozilla said on its blog. ""Browsers and websites need to turn off SSLv3 and use more modern security protocols as soon as possible.""Microsoft Corp issued an advisory suggesting that customers disable SSL 3.0 on Windows for servers and PCs.Representatives with Apple Inc could not be reached. An Oracle Corp spokeswoman had no immediate comment.Matthew Green, an assistant research professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins University said that disabling SSL 3.0 can be difficult for some computer users.""It's not going to take out the infrastructure of the Internet. But it's going to be a hassle to fix,"" Green said.   (Reporting by Jim Finkle.

508,"  SAN FRANCISCO Satya Nadella, the Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief Executive who ignited a firestorm of protest earlier this month by suggesting women should not ask for pay raises, said on Monday that men and women are paid equally at his company. Nadella's statement, made at a presentation on cloud computing in San Francisco, runs counter to some limited data made public by employees, but is unverifiable given that Microsoft does not release details of its pay structure.""I checked that it is something that we are enforcing,"" said Nadella, when asked about equal pay. ""We are in fact in good shape. Men and women get paid equally at Microsoft.""Nadella said he was ""humbled"" by his experience on Oct. 9, when he told a conference celebrating women in computing that women should not ask for pay raises but trust in ""karma"" to give them the salary they deserve.

509,"  SAN FRANCISCO Oct 20 Satya Nadella, the Microsoft Corp Chief Executive who ignited a firestorm of protest earlier this month by suggesting women should not ask for pay raises, said on Monday that men and women are paid equally at his company.Nadella's statement, made at a presentation on cloud computing in San Francisco, runs counter to some limited data made public by employees, but is unverifiable given that Microsoft does not release details of its pay structure.""I checked that it is something that we are enforcing,"" said Nadella, when asked about equal pay. ""We are in fact in good shape. Men and women get paid equally at Microsoft.""Nadella said he was ""humbled"" by his experience on Oct. 9, when he told a conference celebrating women in computing that women should not ask for pay raises but trust in ""karma"" to give them the salary they deserve.

511,"   By Chris Taylor | NEW YORK  NEW YORK If your kids are chattering non-stop about things like emeralds, pickaxes and creepers, you may have a unique opportunity to turn a video game addiction into a life lesson about money.Minecraft, a video game phenomenon with over 100 million users, is such a hot property that Microsoft Corp recently forked out $2.5 billion for its maker, Mojang AB. Players build their own worlds via game systems, smartphones, tablets and computers using virtual Lego-like pieces. And as opposed to the shoot-'em-up video games that kids usually gravitate toward, this game teaches them about money.It is ""about barter, about value, about how to protect your stuff,"" says Hank Mulvihill, a financial adviser in Richardson, Texas.""Kids are learning about money on a lot of different levels in Minecraft,"" says Joel Levin, co-founder of Manhattan-based TeacherGaming, a firm that works with educators to use video games as teaching tools.""There are basic currencies, like emeralds that you dig up and can trade with villagers,"" Levin explains. ""There are exchange rates, because certain items are worth more than others. Then players have to think about whether to spend money right away, or save it and get something more rewarding later on. These are analogous to the financial decisions people are making in the real world all the time.""And that is just if you are playing the game on your own. If you are online with multiple players, the financial issues become much more complex.""At that point, players are setting up actual economies,"" Levin says. ""On a particular server, they may decide that diamonds are the currency of choice. Or some kids start playing the role of a bank, offering loans and charging interest.""Levin is aware of instances where teachers introduce a rare item into the game that kids can't obtain on their own, and then watch them react to the scarcity. ""It's supply and demand in action,"" he says.HOW TO START FROM NOTHING Of course, most parents only experience Minecraft by peering over their kids' shoulders and trying to figure out what the hell is going on.  So in case you were wondering, here are a few of Minecraft's key financial lessons:When starting out in the world of Minecraft, ""nobody tells you anything, no instructions,"" says 19-year-old Harvey Mulvihill, son of Hank, who plays along with his two brothers. ""You are a stranger in a strange land, and you have to figure out how to gain resources.""Indeed, Minecraft is a so-called ""sandbox"" game, in which players roam a virtual world with very few limitations. In that way, it is a riff on the traditional American archetype of the Horatio Alger story - starting from nothing and somehow making a huge success of yourself. Players have to gain skills and then leverage those skills to develop a better world for themselves.HOW TO PROTECT WHAT YOU HAVE  As in life, very bad things happen all the time in Minecraft - death, robbery, physical attacks and disasters of all stripes. As a result, players have to protect themselves against a number of terrible futures.For example: travel light. ""It is never a good idea to carry your valuables on your person,"" advises 17-year-old Patrick Mulvihill. ""Once you die your things are dropped on the spot of death. Valuables should be kept in chests in safe, well-lit places.""But it is not just death players have to insure themselves against. That is because some people in this virtual world - known as ""griefers,"" according to Patrick - go online solely to steal and break other people's things.HOW TO MAKE THE RIGHT CONNECTIONS Life is all about who you know, and Minecraft is no different. Connecting with the right people can make your virtual life a whole lot easier. ""If I was starting from scratch and didn't know any coding, I could be digging for emeralds forever,"" says Dan Short, associate professor of environmental science at Robert Morris University in Pittsburgh, who has written an academic paper on Minecraft.""But if you are on a server with other kids, the server owner can basically give you as many emeralds as you need. They're like little monarchs."" The moral of the story? Your network counts, and you should develop it as much as possible.HOW TO MONETIZE YOUR SKILLS Once you become talented at something, you could find yourself in serious demand. Fifteen-year-old Sean Mulvihill plays with his buddies Jackson, Oscar and Wyatt. ""Jackson is known for being the best builder, and others pay him to build them a house,"" Sean says.Meanwhile, Sean is seen as ""by far, the best farmer,"" he notes modestly. As a result, other players come to him with business propositions, like supplying him with seed, equipment and gold in order to tend their farms and divvy up the profits.This principle of monetizing your Minecraft skills applies in the real world, too, notes Short. Some have become so talented at the game and charismatic with their audiences - with handles like TheBajanCanadian, Sky Does Minecraft and Lewis & Simon - that they run their own insanely popular channels on Google Inc's YouTube.""They get followers on YouTube, they host games and then kids sometimes pay a premium for the chance to play with them and be in their videos,"" Short says. ""They must be making serious bank. That might be the biggest financial lesson of all.""

515,"   By Andrew Chung and Dan Levine  For two decades, companies that buy software patents to sue technology giants have been the scourge of Silicon Valley. Reviled as patent trolls, they have attacked everything from Google's online ads to Apple's iPhone features, sometimes winning hundreds of millions of dollars. But now the trolls are in retreat from the tech titans, interviews and data reviewed by Reuters show. In the wake of several changes in U.S. law, which make it easier to challenge software patents, patent prices are plummeting, the number of court fights is down, and stock prices of many patent-holding companies have fallen. Some tech firms say they are punching up research budgets as legal costs shrink, while support for major patent reform is under fire as trolls get trounced.""Their entire business model relies on intimidation, and that has lost its edge,"" said Efrat Kasznik, president of intellectual property consulting firm Foresight Valuation Group. ""If the patents are not enforceable in court anymore... the troll has no legs to stand on.""Brokers who work with the patent acquisition companies acknowledge the new climate.""In some cases, there are just no current buyers for these patents at all,"" said Robert Aronoff, founder of the patent brokerage Pluritas, citing new legal standards for the change. NetApp, a Silicon Valley maker of sophisticated data storage devices, last month used a new legal precedent to force a patent holder to pay its legal fees. The judge called the case ""reckless and wasteful.""The new playing field allows NetApp to spend more on developing its own patents, as opposed to litigation defense. ""It is freeing up dollars,"" said Douglas Luftman, NetApp's chief intellectual property counsel.To be sure, not all litigious patent owning companies are losing ground. Some with court-tested patents are doing well. And not all big tech companies are convinced of the change.Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) has been at the forefront of the fight against infringement lawsuits and has not seen a drop in new suits in recent months, said General Counsel Mark Chandler.Cisco will continue to push for laws to stop warrantless lawsuits, Chandler said. Others see the need diminishing. THE BIRTH OF TROLLS Big tech companies distinguish between their own intellectual property, which they fiercely protect, and those of their adversaries, which they often dismiss as broadly worded and vague, allowing holders to sue all manner of defendants. The big tech companies note that the patent acquisition companies they label as trolls generally make no products but are solely in the business of buying patents and litigating to enforce them.The putative trolls see a different world. They buy patents from inventors and each other, creating a marketplace that checks big tech companies' sway, and rely ultimately on a fair arbiter: courts. This can provide vital protection for investors' ideas, said Matt Vella, CEO of Acacia Research Corp, which contracts with owners to license their patents to other companies. “I see it as a Robin Hood function,” he said.If the so-called trolls had a birth date, it would be the summer of 1994, when a federal appeals court explicitly allowed computer program patents for the first time. In the ensuing years, software patents exploded, covering topics from Wi-Fi to one-click shopping. So did patent lawsuits. Last year, more than 6,000 patent suits were filed, according to intellectual property analytics firm Lex Machina. A 2013 White House report said ""trolls"" were responsible for 60 percent of suits, up from 29 percent in 2010. Congress struck the first blow against these high-volume plaintiffs in an overhaul of the patent system. Starting in 2012, companies accused of infringement could ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to invalidate patents used in litigation. The reviews are much cheaper and faster than court.The reviews proved popular -- and devastating for many patent owners. As of June, the patent office was invalidating some or all of challenged patents' claims at a rate of 80 to 90 percent, depending on the type of review. Then, in June of this year, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a basic idea -- not normally eligible for a patent -- does not become patent-worthy if run on a computer. That case, Alice vs. CLS Bank, has made it easier still to quash software patents, and at least 13 lower court rulings since then have done just that.MOUNTING EVIDENCE New federal patent lawsuits last month were down 40 percent from the previous year, to 329 cases, data from Lex Machina show.  Defendants are also fighting longer, driving up costs for the acquisition companies. In 2004, the median time it took for a case that didn't settle was 467 days. By 2013, that had reached 673 days, according to Lex Machina.Intellectual Ventures, one of the largest private patent buyers, laid off over 20 percent of its workforce this year. The company began with backing from big tech companies who saw it as an ally, but some longtime investors including Apple and Intel declined to participate in its latest funding round. Intellectual Ventures declined to comment.A survey of private patent deals compiled by brokerage IPOfferings, found the average price of a patent was $165,000 in the second quarter of 2014, down from $375,000 in 2012.Some patents have withstood challenges under the new legal rules, however. Marathon Patent Group(MARA.O) announced last month that the U.S. government rejected a request by ARM Holdings to invalidate a Marathon patent. Marathon is trading up 28 percent since mid-June.Michael Friedman, managing director at IP strategy firm Ocean Tomo, said patents on widely used technology owned by companies like IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm, are still in a strong position to seek licenses. But some companies whose business model depends on successful litigation have seen their stock slide since Alice, the 2014 Supreme Court case. InterDigital (IDCC.O) has fallen over 5 percent and Acacia Research Corp (ACTG.O) is down over 9 percent. (See graphic: link.reuters.com/rej23w) Just three weeks after Alice was decided, an Acacia Research subsidiary felt its reach when a federal appeals court backed the revocation of a patent on digital image processing, used to sue over 30 tech firms. Acacia is appealing and said that in general, its other patents will not be impacted by Alice in the same way, since few deal with the kinds of software methods Alice puts at risk. Still, Vella, Acacia's CEO, said, said his company sensed the changing legal landscape and is shifting its strategy, away from one-patent cases to challenges based on several patents.

517,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by stronger sales of its phones, Surface tablets and cloud-computing products for companies, while keeping its profit margins largely intact.The results on Thursday allayed fears of investors in recent days that the industry shift toward lower-margin cloud services was proving hard for established technology leaders to master. Microsoft shares, which have climbed 33 percent over the past year, rose another 3 percent in after-hours trading to $46.36.""In light of recent negative earnings results from tech bellwethers Oracle, IBM, SAP, VMware, and EMC, Microsoft is bucking the trend and we would label these September results as a solid accomplishment,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. Investors were keenly watching Microsoft after harsh warnings from International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) and SAP (SAPG.DE) about operating profits as they make tentative inroads into the cloud, which generally yields thinner margins than technology companies are used to. Microsoft did not disclose its cloud-based revenue for the fiscal first quarter, but said commercial cloud sales rose 128 percent, while sales of services based on its Azure cloud platform rose 121 percent. Perhaps more importantly, it said gross profit margin in the unit that includes Azure rose 194 percent, despite rising infrastructure costs, which includes the huge expense of building and operating datacenters. In the last four years, Microsoft's gross profit margin has drifted down to about 65 percent from above 80 percent, largely due to its move into the less profitable business of making tablets and phones, but accelerated by the move to the cloud. Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund figures Microsoft is on track to hit $6 billion a year in cloud revenue soon, which would make it the industry's largest cloud vendor by his calculations. That represents only about 6 percent of overall expected revenue this fiscal year, but investors are highly sensitive to a business they see as key to the future.""We're the only company with cloud revenue at our scale that is growing at triple digit rates,"" said Satya Nadella, on a conference call with analysts. Nadella was keen to stress that Microsoft is more focused on selling higher-margin services via the cloud to its commercial customers rather than just storage and computing power. ""Our premium services on Azure create new monetization opportunities in media, data, machine learning, fast analytics, and enterprise mobility,"" he said. PROFIT FELL ON CHARGE Microsoft's fiscal first-quarter profit actually fell 13 percent, largely due to an expected $1.1 billion charge related to mass layoffs announced in July, which lopped 11 cents per share off earnings. Including that charge, the world's largest software company reported profit of $4.5 billion, or 54 cents per share, compared with $5.2 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Still, it easily beat Wall Street's forecast of 49 cents per share, including the charge, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The charge resulted from Microsoft's plan, launched in July,  to cut 18,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of its workforce, with most of those cuts coming from its newly acquired Nokia phone business.Revenue rose 25 percent to $23.2 billion, helped by the phone business it bought from Nokia in April, handily exceeding analysts' average estimate of $22 billion.Sales of its Lumia smartphones hit 9.3 million in the first full quarter since the close of the Nokia deal.

518,"  (Adds CEO quote, Lumia, Surface sales)By Bill RigbySEATTLE Oct 23 Microsoft Corp reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue, helped by stronger sales of its phones, Surface tablets and cloud-computing products for companies, while keeping its profit margins largely intact.The results on Thursday allayed fears of investors in recent days that the industry shift toward lower-margin cloud services was proving hard for established technology leaders to master.Microsoft shares, which have climbed 33 percent over the past year, rose another 3 percent in after-hours trading to $46.36.""In light of recent negative earnings results from tech bellwethers Oracle, IBM, SAP, VMware, and EMC, Microsoft is bucking the trend and we would label these September results as a solid accomplishment,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Investors were keenly watching Microsoft after harsh warnings from International Business Machines Corp and SAP about operating profits as they make tentative inroads into the cloud, which generally yields thinner margins than technology companies are used to.Microsoft did not disclose its cloud-based revenue for the fiscal first quarter, but said commercial cloud sales rose 128 percent, while sales of services based on its Azure cloud platform rose 121 percent. Perhaps more importantly, it said gross profit margin in the unit that includes Azure rose 194 percent, despite rising infrastructure costs, which includes the huge expense of building and operating datacenters.In the last four years, Microsoft's gross profit margin has drifted down to about 65 percent from above 80 percent, largely due to its move into the less profitable business of making tablets and phones, but accelerated by the move to the cloud.Nomura analyst Rick Sherlund figures Microsoft is on track to hit $6 billion a year in cloud revenue soon, which would make it the industry's largest cloud vendor by his calculations. That represents only about 6 percent of overall expected revenue this fiscal year, but investors are highly sensitive to a business they see as key to the future. ""We're the only company with cloud revenue at our scale that is growing at triple digit rates,"" said Satya Nadella, on a conference call with analysts.Nadella was keen to stress that Microsoft is more focused on selling higher-margin services via the cloud to its commercial customers rather than just storage and computing power. ""Our premium services on Azure create new monetization opportunities in media, data, machine learning, fast analytics, and enterprise mobility,"" he said.PROFIT FELL ON CHARGE  Microsoft's fiscal first-quarter profit actually fell 13 percent, largely due to an expected $1.1 billion charge related to mass layoffs announced in July, which lopped 11 cents per share off earnings.Including that charge, the world's largest software company reported profit of $4.5 billion, or 54 cents per share, compared with $5.2 billion, or 62 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.Still, it easily beat Wall Street's forecast of 49 cents per share, including the charge, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The charge resulted from Microsoft's plan, launched in July,  to cut 18,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of its workforce, with most of those cuts coming from its newly acquired Nokia phone business.Revenue rose 25 percent to $23.2 billion, helped by the phone business it bought from Nokia in April, handily exceeding analysts' average estimate of $22 billion.Sales of its Lumia smartphones hit 9.3 million in the first full quarter since the close of the Nokia deal. Sales of the Surface tablet more than doubled to $908 million from $400 million in the year-ago quarter.

522,"  * Q3 core EBIT 457 mln euros vs 359 mln euros in Reuters poll* Networks unit profitability up from previous quarter* Lifts networks margin outlook for 2014* Shares rise 2.8 pct   (Adds comments, detail, updates shares)By Jussi RosendahlHELSINKI, Oct 23 Nokia delivered quarterly profits well above expectations on Thursday, six months after selling its struggling handset business to Microsoft in a 5.6 billion euros ($7.1 billion) deal that transformed it into a pure play network equipment maker.The Finnish company reported strong earnings from its core network gear unit and lifted the outlook for the business following large network roll-outs in North America and China.Despite concerns over lower-margin deals in China, Nokia's network unit showed a core operating profit margin of 13.5 percent, up from 11.0 percent in the second quarter and topping analysts' average forecast of 9.9 percent in a Reuters poll.Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said the unit saw growth in several regions and booked plenty of high-margin mobile broadband deals, but added it also benefited from one-off factors. ""There was some catch-up in sales in the third quarter with regard to some component shortages we had in the early part of the year,"" he told Reuters.Nokia, which ranks third in the global network-equipment market after Ericsson and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd , said it now expects the network unit's full-year core operating margin to be slightly above 11 percent.That compares with its previous forecast of at or slightly above the higher end of its long-term target range of 5 percent to 10 percent.Shares in the company rose 2.8 percent to 6.69 euros by 1406 GMT after hitting 6.94 euros earlier on Thursday.Nokia's stock is up more than 130 percent since Microsoft announced in September 2013 that it would acquire Nokia's once-dominant phone business, which had failed to recover from a late start in smartphones. Nokia said on Thursday it had written down 1.2 billion euros of goodwill from HERE, its small navigation technology unit. But it retained a positive outlook for the business, which sold map data licenses for the embedded navigation systems of 3.2 million new cars in the quarter, showing zero operating profit.CYCLICAL BUSINESS Suri took over as CEO in April after heading the networks unit, which had been a joint venture with Siemens  until 2013. Suri led the turnaround at the troubled business, divesting non-core activities and cutting thousands of jobs. Analysts said network gear makers have seen a good year with telecom operators investing in 4G roll-outs, but that the cycle could change quickly.""Nokia's profitability is developing better than those of its rivals ... That is due to the comprehensive savings programme that Suri has carried out in the past,"" said Mikael Rautanen, analyst at Inderes Equity Research, who had a buy-rating on the stock.""But one should still remember that these type of (network) projects come in cycles, so the profitability improvement is not permanent.""Danske Capital fund manager Juha Varis, however, noted that Nokia has reported higher-than-forecast profitability through the year.He added the network unit's long-term target range, operating margin of 5-10 percent, looked rather low and said the company should clarify its view of market dynamics.""They have been clearly too cautious on their guidance ... Perhaps they could lift the long-term target range somewhat, the margin hasn't been around 5 percent for some time,"" Varis said.Nokia closed the Microsoft deal in April, leaving it with the network equipment unit, navigation technology business and a smartphone patent portfolio.Nokia's total underlying operating profit for the July-September period rose 32 percent from the previous quarter to 457 million euros ($578 million). Analysts had expected an operating profit of 359 million euros.

MSCI's all-country world equity index rose 3.1 percent for the week, marking its biggest weekly percentage gain since July 2013, while the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 was up 5.5 percent from its low on Oct. 15 and notched its best weekly gain in almost two years. Solid U.S. corporate results bolstered shares over the week.      News late on Thursday of the first person to test positive for Ebola in New York City weighed on European shares, and while the scare initially held back buying in the United States, U.S. investors later shook off those concerns.      ""Ebola is something you want to keep an eye on, but the probability of widespread infection is pretty small, and I think that's what the market believes,"" said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis.     ""Stocks were oversold. Investors were over-worried about global growth, they were over-worried about Ebola,"" he added on reasons for the stock market rally over the week.      Corporate earnings were mixed. Microsoft and Procter & Gamble rose following their quarterly results, offsetting a plunge in Amazon after the online retailer reported an earnings miss. Microsoft shares closed up 2.5 percent at $46.13, while Amazon shares closed down 8.3 percent at $287.06.     The euro rose against the dollar on the view that a weekend update on the euro zone banking sector's financial health would not reveal too many problems at the region's top banks. As of the end of 2013, 25 banks failed the European stress tests, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.

MSCI's all-country world equity index was set for its biggest weekly gain since July 2013, while the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 was on pace for its first weekly gain in five and best week since the start of 2013, bolstered by solid U.S. corporate results.

""I think the fears are a bit overdone. In previous cases, such as avian flu, the virus ended up being contained quite quickly,"" said Caroline Vincent, European equities fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management.

Microsoft  shares were last up 1.6 percent at $45.75, while Amazon <AMZN.O. shares were last down 7.4 percent at $290.1.     U.S. Treasuries prices were up slightly as worries about the virus stoked safe-haven demand for low-risk U.S. government debt, while the dollar was slightly lower as traders covered short positions against the euro.      The euro zone's banking index edged up as investors bet that an update on the sector's financial health from the European Central Bank would not reveal too many problems at the region's top banks.

544,"  LONDON Musician and philanthropist Bob Geldof, who in 1984 inspired a host of rock stars to record a charity single for Africa, will raise money to combat Ebola with a new version of the song.Geldof, frontman for Irish new wave band The Boomtown Rats, pulled together the Band Aid supergroup for ""Do They Know It's Christmas?"" three decades ago to help those affected by famine in Ethiopia.Geldof confirmed at a news conference in London that the song would be re-recorded, with words to the original version, which he co-wrote with Midge Ure, tweaked to play down the previous emphasis on feeding the hungry.He said he took the step after the United Nations had contacted him, saying help was urgently needed to prevent the disease from spreading beyond West Africa.""This is a particularly pernicious illness because it renders humans untouchable and that is sickening,"" Geldof said. ""Mothers can't comfort their children in their dying hours, lovers can't cradle each other,"" he added, referring to the fact that the virus is spread by close bodily contact.The new line-up is expected to include boy band One Direction and singers Ed Sheeran and Sam Smith, British media reports said. The original song, which raised 8 million pounds ($11 million), featured some of the era's biggest acts including U2's Bono, George Michael and David Bowie. It has been re-recorded twice in 1989 and 2004.The song topped the charts in 1984 and sold millions of copies, with proceeds going to Ethiopian famine relief. They followed it up with Live Aid in 1985, a transatlantic concert that raised an estimated $100 million for Ethiopia.Ebola has killed 4,950 people out of more than 13,000 infected since it broke out in West Africa earlier this year, according to the World Health Organization, mostly in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.

Microsoft suffered its last major Azure outage in August.

570,"  (Adds details on Microsoft payments)By Yashaswini Swamynathan and Devika  Krishna KumarDec 4 Barnes & Noble Inc struck a deal to buy Microsoft Corp's stake in Nook Media LLC, ending a two-year partnership and clearing the way for the bookseller to spin off its loss-making e-reader and digital content division.Barnes & Noble shares closed down 5.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange after the company also reported a much-weaker-than-expected quarterly profit, due to lower sales of Nook devices.The company estimated the value of the cash and share deal at about $125 million.Nook, launched in 2009, enjoyed initial success but has ended up costing Barnes & Noble hundreds of millions of dollars as it was unable to keep pace with Amazon.com Inc's  Kindle and Apple Inc's iPad. Microsoft invested $300 million in Barnes & Noble's Nook e-reader in 2012 to gain a foothold in the fast-growing e-books market. As of Sept. 9, Microsoft owned about 17 percent of Nook Media through preferred shares.Barnes & Noble said in June it would spin off its Nook Media business, which includes college bookstores, to focus on its  retail book business. ""We mutually agreed that it made sense to terminate the agreement,"" a Microsoft spokesman said in an email. Microsoft will lose money on its initial investment, but will also be spared any future payments to fund Nook, which were running at about $21 million per quarter.Under the agreement announced on Thursday, Microsoft will have the right to receive about 22.7 percent of total proceeds of Nook's digital business, which excludes the college bookstores, if it is sold in the next three years.Pearson Plc owns 5 percent of Nook Media, which had revenue of $815 million in the second quarter ended Nov. 1. The company said it would buy Microsoft's stake in Nook Media for $62.4 million in cash and about 2.7 million in shares.Barnes & Noble said it now expected to complete the separation of its Nook Media business at the end of August 2015. It had earlier expected to complete it by March.The company said its total revenue fell 2.6 percent to $1.69 billion in the second quarter. Retail sales fell 3.6 percent.Net income fell to $12.3 million, or 12 cents per share, from $13.2 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier.   Analysts on average expected a profit of 31 cents per share on revenue of $1.69 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

571,"  * Major indexes move between solid losses and slight gains* Energy shares remain volatile; crude oil falls again* Microsoft rises, limiting the market's decline* Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all down 0.1 pct   (Updates to close)By Ryan VlastelicaNEW YORK, Dec 4 U.S. stocks ended slightly lower on Thursday after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi brushed off pressure for more immediate monetary policy action but said the issue would be addressed early next year.The day's losses were slight but broad, with seven of the ten primary S&P 500 sectors ending in negative territory and no sector up more than 0.3 percent. Draghi said the ECB would reassess the impact of its stimulus early in 2015 and take further action if necessary, but didn't mention a specific timeline.The S&P 500 fell as much as 0.6 percent before rebounding and briefly turned positive. The Dow had touched an intraday record.""I wasn't expecting much from the ECB, which doesn't want to paint itself into a corner, but eventually we'll need to see action, not just words,"" said Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management in Monument, Colorado.The ECB met under growing pressure to prevent the bloc's economy from entering recession. The bank has already cut borrowing costs to record lows, given cheap loans to banks, and started buying debt to kick-start lending and bolster growth. ""We expect more stimulus will eventually happen, and it will really help the European economy,"" said Lloyd, who helps oversee $16 billion in assets. ""We're very bullish on Europe going into next year.""The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.52 points, or 0.07 percent, to 17,900.1, the S&P 500 lost 2.41 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,071.92 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 5.04 points, or 0.11 percent, to 4,769.44.The day's losses were concentrated in energy shares, where the S&P Energy sector lost 0.8 percent alongside a 1 percent drop in the price of crude oil. ConocoPhillips  fell 2.1 percent to $69.31 while Chevron Corp was off 1.3 percent at $112.28. The moves follow three days of gains, when the group advanced 3.2 percent.Microsoft Corp rose 1.6 percent to $48.84, limiting the decline in all three major indexes. Earlier, Barnes & Noble Inc struck a deal to buy Microsoft's stake in Nook Media LLC in a deal valued at $125 million. Shares of Barnes & Noble fell 5.4 percent to $21.03.Investors are looking ahead to the government's non-farm payrolls report for November, due before the market opens on Friday. Expectations are that the U.S. economy created 230,000 jobs last month.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE 1,957 to 1,117, for a 1.75-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,625 issues fell and 1,068 advanced for a 1.52-to-1 ratio favoring decliners.The S&P 500 was posting 102 new 52-week highs and 8 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite was recording 133 new highs and 89 new lows.About 6.02 billion shares traded on all U.S. platforms, according to BATS exchange data.

575,"  SEATTLE Microsoft Corp expects to have its new Windows 10 operating system on the market by autumn 2015, slightly later than previous comments had suggested.Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner told Japanese news service Nikkei on Wednesday that the new system would be released ""early next fall.""Microsoft has not publicly set a firm timetable for the release of Windows 10, but only last week suggested the possibility of an earlier release.""By next late summer and early fall we'll be able to bring out this particular OS (operating system).

An autumn release would put Windows 10 on track for launch three years after Windows 8, which got a mixed reception as it confused many traditional PC users with a design more suited to tablets. Microsoft unveiled the name Windows 10 in late September, saying the jump in numbers from 8 to 10 marked a leap as it looks to unify the way people work on tablets, phones and traditional computers. An early test version of Windows 10 - which blends the traditional look and much-loved start menu with newer features - has been available for download from Microsoft's website for more than two months. Windows is still a core part of Microsoft's business and dominates the desktop computing market with 1.5 billion users.

577,"   By Kazunori Takada | SHANGHAI  SHANGHAI Sony Corp should fear China's censors almost as much as rival Microsoft Corp as it prepares to unveil the price and release date of its PlayStation 4 gaming console in the world's third-largest gaming market.The announcement, due to be made in Shanghai around 0900 GMT on Thursday, comes hot on the heels of the launch of Microsoft's Xbox console in China as both firms rush to capitalize on the lifting a 14-year ban on foreign gaming consoles.Sony has yet to detail its plans for the PlayStation 4 in China, including the price tag and sales targets. But consumer technology analysts say one key variable could be beyond the company's control: Beijing's notoriously tough censors.""The Chinese censor will be Sony's biggest challenge,"" said Roger Sheng, research director at tech research firm Gartner.China's tight censorship regime is expected to limit the number of gaming titles available, at least initially, as all software needs official approval before it can be sold, analysts say. These approvals can take a long time.

The move, confirmed by a company spokesperson, comes as Facebook has revamped its own search offerings, introducing a tool on Monday that allows users to quickly find past comments and other information posted by their friends on Facebook.     The decision may reflect the increasing importance that Facebook sees in Web search technology, a market dominated by rival Google Inc (GOOGL.O).

588,"  (Adds detail about patent valuation and comment from RPX, Microsoft)By Andrew ChungNEW YORK Dec 23 Patent risk management company RPX Corp said on Tuesday it would buy patents owned by Apple Inc and other firms for $900 million, helping to further scale back lawsuits over smartphone technology.The sale consists of the more than 4,000 patents still owned by Rockstar Consortium, which was formed from the $4.5 billion purchase of about 6,000 Nortel Network Corp patents in 2011 following its bankruptcy.The deal puts an end to litigation started last year by Rockstar against several handset manufacturers whose phones operate on Google Inc's Android operating system, which fiercely competes with Apple mobile products. While the sale price is far less than what Rockstar had paid for the original 6,000 patents, the most valuable 2,000 of them had already been distributed to consortium members, RPX Chief Executive John Amster said.The deal was partly motivated by the Rockstar owners rethinking their strategy for the patents, Amster said, noting that he expects Rockstar will cease to exist in its current form after the sale. RPX was formed primarily to buy patents before the sellers can be sued for infringement. The sellers pay RPX a fee that it says is cheaper than the cost of fighting the patents in court.As part of the deal, RPX also said it will license the patents to more than 30 companies, including Google and Cisco Systems Inc, both of which last November settled patent lawsuits filed against them by Rockstar. Besides Apple, Rockstar also includes Microsoft Corp , Sony Corp, Blackberry and Ericsson .""I think they were not thrilled at the litigation and thought there was a more efficient way to get fair value for the portfolio,"" Amster said. ""It could have taken many years more of litigation to get the same value.Ericsson said the deal was good news for the industry. Microsoft said it ""demonstrates our patent system working to promote innovation."" Apple, Sony, Google and Blackberry all declined to comment.The deal is the latest to help calm the protracted smartphone legal battles. Earlier this year, Apple and Google agreed to drop all lawsuits between them, and Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd did the same for litigation outside of the United States.

590,"  (Adds Sony's no comment on number of downloads, Microsoft comment, comments from Los Angeles moviegoers.)By Luc Cohen and Alicia AvilaNEW YORK/LOS ANGELES Dec 25 ""The Interview,"" the Sony Pictures film about a fictional plot to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, opened in more than 300 movie theaters across the United States on Christmas Day, drawing many sell-out audiences and statements by patrons that they were championing freedom of expression.Co-directors Evan Goldberg and Seth Rogen, who also co-stars in the low-brow comedy with James Franco, surprised moviegoers by appearing at the sold-out 12:30 a.m. PT (0830 GMT) screening of the movie at a theater in Los Angeles, where they briefly thanked fans for their support.Sony Pictures  this week backtracked from its original decision to cancel the release of the $44 million film after major U.S. theater chains pulled out because of threats by the group claiming responsibility for a destructive cyberattack on Sony last month.The United States blamed the attacks on North Korea.Movie theater managers and patrons alike said they believed there was nothing to fear, and the initial screenings on Thursday were uneventful.The audience at the first screening of the film in New York City, at the Cinema Village in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, remained silent during a scene showing the death of Kim Jong Un in the downing of his helicopter.Matt Rosenzweig, 60, of Manhattan, said the moments that drew the most applause had to do with the idea of acting against censorship rather than animosity toward North Korea.The film is available online in the United States on Google Inc's  Google Play and YouTube Movie and to customers of Microsoft's Xbox Video, as well as on a Sony website, www.seetheinterview.com. It can be seen in Canada on the Sony site and Google Canada's website.A Sony spokeswoman on Thursday said she had no figures on the number of downloads so far or on how well the movie was doing at the box office. A spokesman for Microsoft also said he had no information yet on downloads and declined to say if the company had taken any special security measures or stepped up customer support.""Of course, it's safe to say holiday season is always a very busy time of year for any consumer electronics company,"" Sean McCarthy, general manager of Microsoft's Xbox Product Services, wrote in an email. ""So we work hard to ensure the stability of our infrastructure when so many consoles are activating for the first time.""RAUCOUS APPLAUSE Cinema Village manager Lee Peterson, who declined to provide details of security precautions, said the New York Police Department planned to have officers outside the theater. He said he had also heard from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There was no visible police presence outside or inside the Cinema Village for the first screening.In Los Angeles, where the film drew a sell-out crowd for the 12:30 a.m. showing, people who held cups of warm cider as they waited for the theater to open said they came to show support for freedom of speech and freedom of choice.The movie, which is playing in theaters in major metropolitan areas as well as in smaller cities ranging from Bangor, Maine, to Jasper, Indiana, features Rogen and Franco as journalists who are recruited by the CIA to assassinate the North Korean leader.Sony decided to release the film after U.S. President Barack Obama, as well as such Hollywood luminaries as George Clooney and Republicans and Democrats in Washington, raised concerns that Hollywood was setting a precedent of self-censorship.In Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, where the first screening at 11:45 a.m. PT was only half full, some filmgoers were blunt about their reasons for attending. ""You need to stand up for these things,"" said Dennis Lavalle, an acting teacher who came with his daughter. ""And I am not going to let a country that regularly depicts in video the nuclear Armageddon of this country and that's OK, and we can't make a satirical picture about something that is not going to happen.""MOVIE FANS HAPPY The audience in Manhattan exited the theater to a throng of network TV cameras and a crowd of people lined up for the next showing.""It was more serious, the satire, than I was expecting,"" said Simone Reynolds, who saw the film while visiting from London. ""There's a message for America in there too about America's foreign policy.""North Korea has called the film an ""act of war.""Most fans simply called ""The Interview"" a funny movie.Ken Jacowitz, a 54-year-old librarian from the New York borough of Queens, called it ""a funny film made by funny people."" He had a message for North Korea and the hackers: ""You have given this movie whole new lives.""(Additional reporting by Mary Milliken, Eric Kelsey and Jed Horowitz; Writing by Leslie Adler; Editing by Howard Goller and Steve Orlofsky)",2014-12-25,MSFT,"Thu Dec 25, 2014 | 3:11pm EST",WRAPUP 4-Sony's 'Interview' draws U.S. moviegoers who trumpet free speech,http://www.reuters.com//article/northkorea-cybersecurity-idUSL1N0U81A720141225?type=companyNews,0.995,0.039,0.851,0.109

597,"  (Adds context)By Kazunori TakadaSHANGHAI Jan 8 Sony Corp will delay sales of the PlayStation 4 gaming console in China, originally scheduled for Jan. 11, due to ""various factors"", the company said in a statement on Thursday.Sony's Computer Entertainment division said a new sale date had not yet been determined, but a company source in China told Reuters that prolonged negotiations with Chinese authorities were part of the reason for the delay.The release would have marked PlayStation's entry into China for the first time at a moment when loss-making Sony is leaning on its gaming business to partially offset weakness in its mobile division. Beijing lifted a 14-year ban on foreign gaming consoles last year, paving the way for Sony's rival Microsoft Corp to launch its newest-generation Xbox in China in September.Despite being the world's third-largest gaming market, where gaming revenues hit $15 billion last year, analysts say China may be a tough market to crack for the console makers because strict censorship rules that prevent the sale of many popular titles could make consoles less attractive to gamers. Sony and Microsoft also face stiff competition from PC and mobile games, which have dominated the Chinese market in their 14-year absence.Sony has said it is in the process of applying for licences for 30 games. The company has sought to head off censorship concerns, saying it is working closely with the government. ""Cooperating with the government, we'll provide a broad range of content for our users in China,"" Hiroyuki Oda, head of Asia business at Sony Computer Entertainment, told reporters in December.Sony plans to sell the PlayStation 4 in China for 2,899 yuan ($467), slightly higher than in the United States, where it sells for around $400. The portable PlayStation Vita has been priced at 1,299 yuan.The Xbox, which sells for 3,699 yuan, currently has 10 titles on sale in China, mainly censor-friendly sporting games such as ""Forza Motorsport 5"".

A source told Reuters that the ECB's Executive Board has proposed a program that would enable the bank to buy 50 billion euros ($58 billion) in bonds per month starting in March. ECB President Mario Draghi will speak to the media at 1330 GMT on Thursday. ""The ECB rumor was very important.

606,"  (Adds details on prototype product, analyst comments)By Bill RigbySEATTLE Jan 21 Microsoft Corp  surprised the tech world on Wednesday with a prototype hologram visor that can bring the Minecraft video game, Skype calls and even the landscape of Mars to three-dimensional life.The ageing tech pioneer, which long ago lost the mantle of the world's most inventive company, is making a bold play to regain that title in the face of stiff competition from Google Inc and Apple Inc.Virtual or enhanced reality is the next frontier in computing interaction, with Facebook Inc focusing on its Oculus virtual reality headset and Google working on its Glass project. Microsoft said its wire-free Microsoft HoloLens device will be available around the same time as Windows 10 this autumn. Industry analysts were broadly excited at the prospect, but skeptical that it could produce a working model at a mass-market price that soon.""That was kind of a 'Oh wow!' moment,"" said Mike Silver, an analyst at Gartner who tried out the prototype on Wednesday. ""You would expect to see a relatively high-priced model this year or next year, then maybe it'll take another couple of years to bring it down to a more affordable level.""Microsoft does not have a stellar record of bringing ground-breaking technology to life. Its Kinect motion-sensing game device caused an initial stir but never gripped the popular imagination. The company showed off a crude test version of the visor - essentially jerry-rigged wires and cameras pulled over the head -  to reporters and industry analysts at a gathering at its headquarters near Seattle.It did not allow any photographs or video of the experience, but put some images on its website. (here) Microsoft has been working on the top-secret project for a few years, and showed off a number of scenarios: manipulating virtual objects that can be sent to a 3D printer, creating a Minecraft-like game environment in a room and letting users point to objects on the other end of the line in a Skype video call.Most realistically, it demonstrated a lifelike panorama of the surface of Mars gathered from NASA's Curiosity Rover. NASA has already been working with Microsoft to develop software called ""OnSight,"" which will allow scientists on earth to virtually explore and plan experiments on Mars.""It is incredible and surprised me in how far the state of the art has progressed with holograms. I kept waiting for Princess Leia to appear,"" said IDC analyst Al Hilwa, referring to the Star Wars character.""But the future wildcard is whether a significant chunk of the population will be willing to wear such gear. We also have to wait and see what compelling applications emerge and how broadly life-changing they are,"" he added.

607,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft Corp on Monday reported a fall in its quarterly profit that was in line with Wall Street forecasts, as sluggish personal computer sales dampened demand for Windows software and the company struggled with the impact of the strong U.S. dollar.Shares of the world's largest software company, which have surged to 14 year highs in the past few months, fell 3 percent in after-hours trading, to $45.63. ""While currency is a headwind for Microsoft and other large international companies, we would characterize the headline numbers as good enough, although some bulls may have been hoping for a bigger beat,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.Microsoft's flagship Windows business has been under pressure for three years as PC sales have declined, although the market appears to be stabilizing in recent months.  Currency shifts against the strong U.S. dollar also crimped profit in the fiscal second quarter, ended Dec. 31, although Microsoft did not specify by how much. Microsoft gets almost three-quarters of its revenue from overseas, but a significant amount of that is still in U.S. dollars. ""Overall, the only surprise I think was in commercial licensing, where we had a little bit of a headwind from foreign exchange as well as macro conditions in China and Japan,"" the company's chief financial officer, Amy Hood, said in a phone interview with Reuters. Commercial licensing is chiefly sales of Windows and Office to business customers, which is Microsoft's biggest revenue generator. Microsoft reported profit of $5.86 billion, or 71 cents per share for the latest quarter, compared with $6.56 billion, or 78 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 8 percent to $26.47 billion, largely due to the acquisition of Nokia's phone handset business last year.Analysts had expected revenue of $26.3 billion and earnings of 71 cents per share, on average, including some restructuring costs.

615,"   By Chuck Mikolajczak and Sinead Carew | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A slew of U.S. multinational companies, from DuPont (DD.N) to Procter & Gamble (PG.N), showed that a strong U.S. dollar hurt their earnings, and several blue-chip exporters said the situation will get worse if the greenback holds its strength.All told, the resurgent U.S. currency could shave up to $12 billion off U.S. companies' fourth-quarter 2014 revenue alone, according to currency expert Wolfgang Koester, chief executive of FireApps, a data analytics company in Phoenix, Arizona, that examines quarterly reports for currency-related losses. The pain is hitting multiple sectors, including industrial companies such as 3M Co (MMM.N), technology companies like Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), airlines such as American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O), healthcare companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), and consumer firms like Procter & Gamble - which all garner a large portion of their sales from outside the United States. ""This is a slow-motion crash,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. It could take a couple of quarters for currency conversion losses to show up, she said. After hitting a 6-1/2 month low in May, the dollar .DXY has surged nearly 20 percent against a basket of major currencies, making overseas sales denominated in other currencies less valuable in dollar terms. The stronger dollar can also make U.S.-made products more expensive for consumers in other currencies and thus cut demand.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, composed of large and well-known companies, was hit especially hard on Tuesday as six of seven companies in the index that reported results since Monday evening declined, with only United Technologies gaining. ""You have companies who don’t normally complain about (the dollar) who are starting to harp on it and it does make sense from an economic perspective that this would be a drag,"" said James Liu, global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds in Chicago. ""It’s really the pace that matters - not just whether it is strengthening or weakening."" HEDGING HELP LIMITED WITH SHARP MOVES The choice for multinationals is stark. They can keep customers loyal by maintaining overseas prices and take a revenue hit from a tough conversion to dollars, or raise prices and risk the loss of customers to cheaper local competitors.While many companies successfully use currency hedging to at least partly protect against foreign exchange-related losses, the speed and extent of recent fluctuations have made it more difficult to hedge. This has also hurt Wall Street analysts' ability to estimate losses.  One of the worst-hit companies appears to be chemicals giant DuPont, which derives roughly 60 percent of its revenue from overseas. DuPont said the strong dollar cut 7 cents per share off fourth-quarter earnings and will shave 60 cents off 2015 earnings per share based on recent currency rates.Procter & Gamble said foreign exchange will reduce its fiscal 2015 sales by 5 percent and its net earnings by 12 percent in what it described as its most significant currency impact ever. Bristol-Myers said it expects foreign exchange rates to cut its 2015 revenue by $800 million and 12 to 14 cents in terms of earnings per share.The impact looks even more abysmal when compared with the 1 cent per share currency impact target that multinationals set for their foreign exchange managers, according to FireApps.American icon Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is also at risk as it brings in roughly 62 percent of its revenue from overseas. It had to close its online store in Russia temporarily in December due to dramatic currency fluctuations. Currency could shave as much as $3 billion off Apple's 2015 revenue even if its hedging strategy succeeds in halving the impact, technology analyst Shannon Cross at Cross Research in Millburn, New Jersey, said ahead of its report.Apple's Chief Financial Officer said on Tuesday that foreign exchange is a ""clear headwind"" included in the company's guidance for the year ahead.Shares in Microsoft, which gets nearly three-quarters of its revenue from overseas, finished off 9.2 percent on Tuesday after it said it was hurt by the strong dollar but gave no specifics.  Medical device maker Stryker Corp (SYK.N) said that if exchange rates stay around current levels, it expects first- quarter and 2015 sales to be hurt by 3 percent to 4 percent. Other notables names citing currency headwinds so far in the earnings season include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) and IBM (IBM.N).Dollar strength already shaved at least $4 billion off U.S. corporate revenue in the third quarter, according to FireApps. But actual losses may be much higher as many firms citing currency impacts did not disclose the amount, it noted.

628,"  SEATTLE Jan 29 Microsoft Corp made its popular Word, Excel and PowerPoint applications available for free on Android tablets on Thursday, marking the latest step in its drive to get as many mobile customers as possible using its software.It also released an app for its popular Outlook email program to run on Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad, hoping to attract the millions of users familiar with Outlook from their work desktops.The new releases are the latest gambits in Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella's attempt to wrest back the initiative in the battle for mobile users, where Microsoft has fallen behind Apple and Google Inc.Nadella broke with decades of tradition last March by releasing a free, touch-friendly version of Office for Apple's iPad, before such software was even available for Microsoft's Windows devices. By giving away its industry-standard Office apps on Apple's popular iOS and Google's Android operating systems, Microsoft is looking to build up a base of users which it can later persuade to sign up for Office 365, the full, Internet-based version of Office starting at $7 a month for personal users. Microsoft has been offering test versions of the Office apps on Android for almost three months, but Thursday marks the first day they are available as finished products from the online Google Play app store.Word, Excel and PowerPoint, the key elements of Microsoft's top-selling Office suite of applications, have been a hit on Apple's mobile devices, with 80 million downloads since last March, according to Microsoft. Microsoft plans to release new, touch-friendly versions of its Office apps for Windows devices later this year when it releases the Windows 10 operating system.The new Outlook app, based on a popular app made by Acompli, which Microsoft bought in December, will allow iPhone and iPad users much easier ways of linking email to calendars and working with file attachments. Microsoft is also releasing a test version of the Outlook app for Android users.

629,"   By Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, Jan 30 (IFR) - Microsoft's coveted Triple A rating could come into question and AT&T is likely to lose its Single A rating after both brand names outlined plans that could see their leverage surge.Microsoft, one of only three Triple A rated corporates in the world, told analysts on its earnings call on Monday that it wanted to complete its entire US$40bn share buyback programme by the end of 2016 - a move that analysts and bankers think could see it almost double its US$28.3bn of outstanding debt with issuance of about US$25bn over the next two years.""Microsoft's leverage will likely increase to the 1.3-1.5 times range in the next couple of years, from around 0.8 times, and that will make it hard to justify the Triple A rating,"" said Jordan Chalfin, senior technology analyst at CreditSights.Microsoft is currently rated Triple A by both Moody's and S&P and AA+ by Fitch.On Tuesday, just days before the government disclosed that AT&T was the largest bidder in its biggest-ever auction of wireless spectrum, the company served notice to analysts that it was now comfortable going from being the lowest leveraged investment-grade telco to possibly more highly geared than Triple B-plus rated Verizon.""It is very conceivable that our net debt-to-Ebitda ratio would go  somewhere in between the 2.0 and 2.5 range,"" said CFO John Stephens on the earnings call. ""We will let the debt rating agencies deal with it as they see fit. But we are comfortable with where we are going and we understand the implications.""The moves by both companies reflect an increasing realisation among the top US corporates that having high ratings is not as relevant as it used to be, now that all-in yields have dropped to such lows.""We expect more companies to leverage up because at this point in time you can issue a fair amount of debt without really having a meaningful impact on default risk or spreads,"" said Stephen Antczak, head of US credit strategy at Citigroup.""And it's clear that companies are rewarded by their shareholders for buying back equity and pursuing acquisitions."" MILD IMPACT The mild impact, at least on funding costs, of a one-notch downgrade on either Microsoft or AT&T, can be seen on an all-in yield basis now that the 10-year Treasury yield has plunged by more than 40bp in January alone, to around 1.68%.On Friday, the 30-year Treasury yield hit 2.24%, the lowest it has ever been.Even looking at credit spreads, which have widened in recent months to compensate for the plunge in Treasury yields, the difference between ratings is minimal.""Microsoft in 10-years trades at 65bp over Treasuries, while [Aa1/AA+ rated] Apple trades at 75bp, so in reality saving 10bp isn't all that much for such a large company,"" said Scott Kimball, senior portfolio manager at Taplin Canida & Habacht, part of the BMO Global group of funds. The same goes for the difference in dropping from Single A to Triple B.AT&T, rated A3/A-/A, had a 3.9% 2024 bond recently trading at 143bp over Treasuries - just 8bp inside the 151bp level on Verizon's 3.5% 2024s, which are rated lower at Baa1/BBB+/A-.Kimball estimates each basis point saves a mere US$100,000 on a US$1bn borrowing.SPENDING SPREE  AT&T's Stephens expressed hopes last May, when the company announced a US$49bn acquisition of satellite broadcaster DirecTV, that the combined company would maintain a Single A rating.But since then, AT&T has also bought Mexico's Iusacell and Nextel, and it bid US$18.2bn in the airwaves auction, the results of which were announced Friday.AT&T, like Verizon, has outlined a three-year deleveraging plan to ratings agencies, but it appears that after having to compete so aggressively at the spectrum auctions, it has re-adjusted its expectations about keeping a Single A rating in the short term.As for Microsoft, its net leverage is actually negative, given that it has US$90bn of cash and US$28.3bn of debt outstanding.But with US$31.1bn of share buybacks left to do, as well as about US$10bn each year in dividend payments, Microsoft's gross leverage - which does not incorporate any cash, even the US$6bn held in the US - could soar above one time.S&P puts more emphasis on Microsoft's net leverage, but bankers and analysts believe Moody's could question why it should keep its Aaa rating on the company now that it is rushing through its buyback programme.""I would definitely think there would be pressure on the Moody's rating because of their gross debt focus,"" said a head of debt capital markets technology origination at one of the biggest bond houses.According to CreditSights' Chalfin, Microsoft will use about US$25bn-$26bn of domestic cash in each of the next two years to pay for the buybacks and dividends.""It seems possible that Microsoft could issue around US$25bn of debt to fund half of its total shareholders returns over the next two years,"" he said.

630,"  (Adds details, analyst comments, updates markets)* Trade deficit widens to $46.6 billion in December* Imports rise 2.2 percent, exports fall 0.8 percent* Weekly jobless claims rise 11,000, less than expectedBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, Feb 5 The U.S. trade deficit in December widened sharply to its highest level since 2012 as a stronger dollar appeared to suck in imports and weigh on exports, which could see the fourth-quarter economic growth estimate revised lower.The Commerce Department said on Thursday the trade deficit jumped 17.1 percent to $46.6 billion, the largest since November 2012. It was the biggest percentage increase since July 2009 and also reflected a sputtering global economy.""It is not hard to come up with reasons for the weakness in today's report - sluggish foreign growth and a strong dollar are the obvious ones,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.Wall Street had expected the trade gap to narrow to $38 billion. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit widened to $54.7 billion from $48.7 billion in November.December's shortfall was wider than the government had assumed when it reported last week that gross domestic product had expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. Trade was estimated to have subtracted 1.02 percentage point from GDP growth.Economists said it now appeared the drag on growth was bigger and they expect the government to lower the fourth-quarter growth estimate by as much as four-tenths of a percentage point when it publishes revisions later this month. On an inflation-adjusted trade-weighted basis, the dollar appreciated 5.3 percent last year.While trade is on the back foot, the labor market is weathering the strong dollar and the global slowdown.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 for the week ended Jan. 31, the Labor Department said in a separate report.The increase, which was less than economists' expectations for a rise to 290,000, left intact the bulk of the prior week's huge decline, which had taken claims to their lowest level since April 2000.U.S. stocks were trading higher, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell. FIRMING LABOR MARKET January's employment report to be released on Friday will likely show that nonfarm payrolls increased 234,000, according to a Reuters survey of economists, which would be the longest stretch of job gains above 200,000 since 1994.A firming labor market, together with lower gasoline prices, is seen bolstering consumer spending, which is expected to drive growth in early 2015.""We still believe the U.S. can remain an oasis of prosperity in the world even if international developments are starting to intrude a little on our buoyant forecasts for 2015,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. In a sign of the consumer-driven strengthening in domestic demand, imports rose 2.2 percent to $241.4 billion in December. The increase was in part due to a jump in petroleum imports, which hit their highest level since May 2013.The higher petroleum imports probably found their way into wholesale inventories and could prove temporary.""We suspect ... storage plays by domestic oil market participants, with a large number of oil investors racing to buy crude at lower prices and storing it amid contango plays,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.Imports of non-petroleum products surged to a record high, also reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar.But with the dollar's rise, exports slipped 0.8 percent to $194.9 billion in December, an eight-month low.A range of companies, including Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, and Microsoft Corp  have warned that the dollar was hurting profits.Exports have been hurt by a labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports, which has been cited by some manufacturers as causing delays in the movement of goods.Exports to Canada and Mexico - the main U.S. trading partners - fell in December. In contrast, exports to Japan, China and the European Union rose in December.The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit fell 5.5 percent to $28.3 billion.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)",2015-02-05,MSFT,"Thu Feb 5, 2015 | 11:11am EST",WRAPUP 2-U.S. trade deficit widens; weekly jobless claims up modestly,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0VF17B20150205?type=companyNews,-0.1199,0.082,0.833,0.085

633,"   By Dan Levine | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd have settled a contract dispute over patent royalties, though terms of the settlement are confidential, Microsoft said in a statement on Monday.Microsoft sued Samsung last year in a federal court in New York, accusing Samsung of breaching a collaboration agreement by initially refusing to make royalty payments after the U.S. company announced its intention to acquire Nokia's   handset business in September 2013.The lawsuit claimed Samsung still owed $6.9 million in interest on more than $1 billion in patent royalties it delayed paying. Samsung has countered that the Nokia acquisition violated its 2011 collaboration deal with Microsoft. In 2011 a technology analyst at Citigroup estimated that Microsoft was getting $5 per Android handset sold by phone maker HTC under a patent agreement, and that Microsoft was looking for up to $12.50 per phone from other handset makers it had yet to come to an agreement with. Microsoft has never confirmed those figures, but neither has it said publicly that the estimates were out of line.To apply the $5 price to Samsung, the Korean company could be paying Microsoft about $1.6 billion per year, based on Samsung's sales of 318 million smartphones in 2014, according to IDC shipment numbers. Samsung said it had agreed in 2011 to pay Microsoft royalties in exchange for a patent license covering phones that ran Google Inc's Android operating system. Samsung also agreed to develop Windows phones and share confidential business information with Microsoft, according to court filings. Once Microsoft acquired Nokia, it became a direct hardware competitor with Samsung, the filings said, and Samsung refused to share some sensitive information because of antitrust concerns.Antitrust regulators in the United States and other countries approved the Nokia acquisition.The settlement on Monday also ends Samsung's request for arbitration with the Hong Kong office of the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce.

637,"   By Noel Randewich and Matthew Miller | SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING  SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) has agreed to pay China a fine of $975 million, the largest in the country's corporate history, ending a 14-month government investigation into anti-competitive practices.The deal also requires Qualcomm to lower its royalty rates on patents used in China, likely helping Chinese smartphone makers like Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd [XTC.UL] and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. It removes a major source of concern among Qualcomm investors, sending shares of the U.S. chipmaker up 1.6 percent to $68.18 in after-hours trading.    China's expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm's opportunities have been clouded by the antitrust investigation, which has also contributed to troubles collecting royalty payments from device makers.Qualcomm said in a statement on Monday it would not contest the China's National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) finding that Qualcomm violated an antitrust law. Asked whether the resolution in China could affect the outcome of ongoing antitrust probes into Qualcomm in Europe and the United States, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said, ""We fully respect their authority, but we don’t believe it’s likely that other agencies will necessarily meet similar conclusions.""The U.S. chipmaker also cut its full-year earnings estimate because of the fine, which Qualcomm said would cost it about 58 cents per share, but it raised the lower end of its revenue forecast slightly. “It removes a significant source of uncertainly from our business and really positions our licensing group to really participate in the full growth of the wireless market in China,” Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf told Reuters in a phone interview. “It’s something we’re happy is over.” Discussions in Beijing over one of the most contentious cases under China's 2008 anti-monopoly law had intensified in recent weeks, culminating in meetings between Qualcomm senior executives and the NDRC on Friday. Under the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm will offer licenses to its current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents - widely used by Chinese device makers - separately from other patents. For companies opting for the new agreement, which applies to phones sold for use in China, Qualcomm will calculate royalties based on 65 percent of the selling price of phones, instead of on the whole price.  Some on Wall Street have speculated that even limited concessions made to Qualcomm's licensing business in China could affect the technology company's licensing deals in other countries.""That's the first time I've ever seen them in writing agree to that and it begs the question of why 65 percent is the right number in China and it's not the right number everywhere,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.As a result of the fine, Qualcomm said it now expects full-year earnings per share of between $3.56 and $3.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with its prior forecast of $4.04 to $4.34. It raised its fiscal 2015 revenue forecast to a range of $26.3 billion to $28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its last forecast of $26 billion to $28 billion. Excluding the cost of the fine and other one-time items, Qualcomm forecast earnings of $4.85 to $5.05 per share, raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $4.75 to $5.05.

641,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, February 09 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'AA+' rating to  Microsoft Corporation's (Microsoft) $10.75 billion senior notes offering. Pro  forma for the senior notes issuance, Fitch's ratings affect $35.3 billion of  total debt. A full list of current ratings follows at the end of this release.  Microsoft announced it will issue $10.75 billion of senior notes with various  maturities to be used for general corporate purposes. Fitch expects Microsoft  will use net proceeds mainly for stock buybacks, given the company's plan to  complete the $31.1 billion remaining under the current $40 billion share  repurchase authorization by Dec. 31, 2016.  Microsoft has $90.2 billion in cash and short-term investments but only $8.1  billion of cash and short-term investments were held in the U.S. as of Dec. 31,  2014. In Fitch's opinion the ratings have limited tolerance to accommodate  material incremental debt and leverage to fund domestic cash requirements  including aggressive share repurchases.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings and Outlook are supported by: --Fitch's expectations that Microsoft Windows will remain the primary operating  system (OS) for servers and PCs, despite lackluster adoption of Windows 8 and  8.1 for PCs, supporting significant annual free cash flow (FCF). --Microsoft's recurring revenue base related to long-term commercial licensing  agreements, which represents more than half of total revenues. --Fitch's expectations that increasing adoption of enterprise cloud services  will further diversify Microsoft's revenue base and increase profitability,  reducing the company's exposure to the less defensible and profitable consumer  PC market.  Ratings concerns center on Fitch's expectations that:  --Microsoft will continue relying on the PC market for the vast majority of FCF,  although Fitch expects faster growing cloud services could reduce this risk over  the longer term. --Competing free or lower cost operating systems may continue reducing  Microsoft's share, primarily in consumer and education markets. Microsoft  competes with Google in the tablet and smartphone markets (Android - roughly  80%) and in the notebook PC market (Chrome). --Success in smartphone and tablet markets could remain modest (below 5% share),  despite significant investments and resource allocation.  --Lackluster consumer PC demand, with the exception of Office 365 (SaaS), will  remain pressured by extended PC replacement cycles due to tablet and smartphone  substitution for traditional PCs.  --Significant dividend and share repurchase programs are likely to continue  pressuring the company to issue debt to avoid repatriation of foreign earnings. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for the issuer include: --$31 billion of share buybacks by the end of December 2016. --Domestic cash needs may require additional debt but the rating case assumes  total debt-to-EBITDAR will remain below 1.5x. --Microsoft does not repatriate overseas cash to the United States.  --Annual FCF of roughly $15 billion.  --Capital spending will remain elevated to support cloud infrastructure  development.  --Dividends between $9.5 billion and $12 billion over the ratings horizon. RATING SENSITIVITIES Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to  negative rating action include: --Fitch's expectations that total debt adjusted for rental expense to operating  EBITDAR sustained near 1.5x, most likely from significant debt issuance to  support shareholder returns. --Material profit margin erosion related competitive pressures, including strong  commercial adoption of the public cloud and/or open-sourced software materially  reduces demand for key Microsoft products; penetration of alternative operating  systems in the PC market or market share gains by Apple; or greater acceptance  of cheaper software applications that compete with Microsoft Office. Positive rating actions are unlikely in the absence of material diversification,  driven by solid organic growth in non-PC businesses. As of Dec. 31, 2014, Fitch believes liquidity is very strong and supported by: --$90.2 billion of cash and short-term investments, of which $8.1 billion was in  the U.S.;  --An undrawn $5 billion revolving credit facility (RCF) expiring Nov. 14, 2018  and an undrawn $5 billion RCF expiring Nov. 4, 2015, both of which backstop the  company's commercial paper (CP) program. --Fitch's expectation for $15 billion of annual FCF also supports liquidity. Total debt was $28.3 billion at Dec. 31, 2014 and consisted of various tranches  of senior notes with staggered debt maturities and $8.3 billion of CP  borrowings. Microsoft's nearest debt maturity, aside from CP borrowings, is $1.8  billion of senior notes due Sept. 25, 2015. Fitch currently rates Microsoft as follows:  --Long-Term IDR at 'AA+'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'AA+'; --RCF at 'AA+'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F1+'; --CP program at 'F1+'.

642,"   By Noel Randewich and Matthew Miller | SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING  SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING Qualcomm Inc has agreed to pay China a fine of $975 million, the largest in the country's corporate history, ending a 14-month government investigation into anti-competitive practices.The deal also requires Qualcomm to lower its royalty rates on patents used in China, the U.S. chip-maker said in a statement.Qualcomm cut its full-year earnings estimate because of the fine, which it said would cost it about 58 cents per share, but it raised the lower end of its revenue forecast slightly.Investors welcomed the end of the drawn-out investigation, sending Qualcomm's shares up 1.6 percent to $68.18 in after-hours trading. ""It removes a significant source of uncertainly from our business and really positions our licensing group to really participate in the full growth of the wireless market in China,"" Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf told Reuters in a phone interview. ""It's something we're happy is over.""Discussions in Beijing over one of the most contentious cases under China's 2008 anti-monopoly law had intensified in recent weeks, culminating in meetings between Qualcomm senior executives and National Development and Reform Commission officials on Friday. Under the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm will not dispute China's finding that it violated the country's anti-monopoly law, and it will offer licenses to its current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents - widely used by Chinese device makers - separately from other patents.As a result of the fine, Qualcomm said it now expects full-year earnings per share of between $3.56 and $3.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with its prior forecast of $4.04 to $4.34. It raised its fiscal 2015 revenue forecast to a range of $26.3 billion to $28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its last forecast of $26 billion to $28 billion.Excluding the cost of the fine and other one-time items, Qualcomm forecast earnings of $4.85 to $5.05 per share, raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $4.75 to $5.05. On that basis, analysts had expected $4.96 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Qualcomm is just one of several overseas companies, including Microsoft Corp, that have come under investigation in China for allegedly anti-competitive practises.

643,"  SHANGHAI Feb 13 Bill Gates, Microsoft Corp's  former CEO, met with China's technology minister this week, said a Friday statement on the ministry website, days after U.S. tech groups expressed concerns over Chinese regulation damaging their businesses.In the meeting with China's Minister of Science and Technology Wan Gang, in which Gates was representing the philanthropic Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the two discussed cooperating on technology and ""innovative development"", Friday's statement said.The statement did not mention Microsoft, for whom Gates remains on the board and spends about a third of his time as technology adviser to CEO Satya Nadella.The environment for U.S. tech companies has become increasingly difficult in China in recent months. Last week, U.S. business lobbies called on the White House for help to overturn new Chinese cybersecurity regulations they said would hurt market opportunities abroad and jobs in the United States. U.S. tech groups wrote to Beijing about the same policies on Jan. 28. Foreign companies are also increasingly concerned they are being targeted by Chinese regulators. Addressing a Chinese anti-monopoly investigation into Microsoft in September, Chief Executive Nadella said the company would fully cooperate with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, which launched a probe into the world's largest software company last summer.The company's mainland subsidiary was charged with about $140 million in back taxes in November, the first U.S. corporation targeted for cross-border tax evasion in China. Microsoft declined to comment on Gates' visit, as it concerns the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.An official at the foundation confirmed the visit but declined to provide further details.

646,"  SEATTLE Two former Microsoft Corp managers have sued the company, saying they were forced out after they raised concerns about an employee's large claims for expenses in South Korea that may have included sex services.The lawsuit, filed by George Engstrom and John Stockwell in state court in Seattle, says an unnamed Microsoft employee ran up entertainment expenses of more than $22,000, including taking potential business partners to South Korean ""hostess bars,"" which often provide sexual services to customers.Microsoft dismissed the claims and said it would fight the matter in court.Engstrom and Stockwell say they alerted Microsoft to the outsize expense claims and possible link to prostitution in 2011 and that the company began an investigation.

650,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Bill Gates stands atop Forbes magazine's annual list of the world's richest people, as Facebook Inc's Mark Zuckerberg joined the top 20 and basketball star Michael Jordan plowed new air by making the list for the first time.Gates' net worth rose to $79.2 billion from $76 billion a year earlier, putting the Microsoft Corp co-founder at the top for the 16th year in the last 21, Forbes said on Monday.Mexico telecommunications mogul Carlos Slim Helu ranked second, worth $77.1 billion, while Berkshire Hathaway Inc chief Warren Buffett was third, at $72.7 billion.Amancio Ortega, the Spanish founder of Inditex SA, which includes clothing retailer Zara, was fourth at $64.5 billion, while Oracle Corp Chairman Larry Ellison was fifth at $54.3 billion.Buffett's fortune grew $14.5 billion from a year earlier, more than anyone's else, despite his having donated $2.8 billion to several charities last July.Aliko Dangote, a Nigerian who became Africa's richest man through cement manufacturing and commodities such as flour and sugar, was the biggest loser, falling $10.3 billion to $14.7 billion. Forbes identified a record 1,826 billionaires, up from 1,645 last year, worth a combined $7.05 trillion.Of the record 197 women, the highest-ranked was Wal-Mart Stores Inc heiress Christy Walton, who was eighth at $41.7 billion.France's Liliane Bettencourt, who got much of her wealth from cosmetics company L'Oreal SA, was 10th at $40.1 billion. Zuckerberg, 30, rose to 16th place from 21st last year, as his net worth grew to $33.4 billion.The youngest billionaires were Evan Spiegel, 24, and Bobby Murphy, 25, who co-founded mobile messaging app Snapchat, and are each worth $1.5 billion.Meanwhile, Jordan ranked 1,741st with a $1 billion net worth. The 52-year-old is majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets basketball team, but is better known for his Hall of Fame playing days with the Chicago Bulls and endorsement contract with Nike Inc, which makes Air Jordan shoes.

651,"   By John Ruwitch and Paul Carsten | HANGZHOU, China, March 4  HANGZHOU, China, March 4 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd is launching a cloud computing hub in Silicon Valley on Wednesday, the e-commerce giant's first outside of China, underscoring its global ambitions in the face of stiff and entrenched competition.The new California data center marks the Chinese company's latest measured expansion onto American soil, and into a hotly contested U.S. market now dominated by Amazon.com Inc, Microsoft Corp and Google Inc.Alibaba's Aliyun cloud division intends the new data center to cater initially to Chinese companies with operations in the United States, including retail, Internet and gaming firms. It will later target U.S. businesses seeking a presence in both countries, Ethan Yu, a vice president at Alibaba who runs the international cloud business, told Reuters.""This is a very strategic move for us,"" Yu said, declining to say how much Alibaba invested in the data center or disclose its location for security reasons. ""International expansion is actually a company strategy in the coming few years.""""Eventually we may expand to other regions, for example the East Coast or middle part of the U.S., if our customers have the demand for that.""Aliyun, which has been likened to a budding version of Amazon Web Services, began as part of the company's in-house technical infrastructure but has since expanded to lease processing and storage space for small and medium Internet businesses in China.While Alibaba dominates e-commerce in China, Aliyun, also known as Alibaba Cloud Computing, holds about a 23 percent market share in its home market. It faces both Chinese and foreign competitors, from carriers like China Telecom  to Microsoft and Amazon. Its existing data centers span the Chinese cities of Hangzhou, Qingdao, Beijing, Shenzhen and Hong Kong. Alibaba is kicking off its U.S. cloud business as American corporations and politicians are protesting what they see as Beijing's efforts to curb foreign technology at home.Chinese government controls have limited foreign competition and disrupted many online services, including Google's and Amazon Web Services', according to censorship watchdogs. This week, U.S. President Barack Obama sharply criticized Chinese regulations that subject overseas companies to arduous measures regarding data management.FIRST THINGS FIRST A more immediate concern may be how Alibaba intends to vie with the likes of Amazon, Microsoft and Google, which are slashing prices on cloud services to try and sustain double-digit growth. They're battling over a public cloud services market that could grow into an $100 billion industry by 2017, according to researcher IDC. U.S. customers are not expected to be bothered by the service's Chinese ownership if pricing is competitive.Alibaba has big plans for Aliyun, which now accounts for about 1 percent of its revenue but supports its core e-commerce operation and will also play a pivotal role in the long run. Alibaba sees cloud computing as key to its plans to aggregate and analyze the vast quantities of data it collects, including on consumer behavior.The company also needs to find ways to sustain so-far stunning growth. Shares in the company fell to their lowest levels since their debut on Tuesday, after rival JD.com's   better-than-expected quarterly results revived concerns that Alibaba's expansion is slowing. Cloud computing and infrastructure was the company's fastest-growing business segment in the December quarter, increasing sales 85 percent to $58 million.Alibaba now derives the vast majority of its revenue from China. In recent months it has made headway in emerging markets from Russia to Brazil, but the company has taken a cautious, calculated approach to the U.S. market.The northern California data node would serve internal Alibaba businesses, like AliExpress, its online B2C platform for buyers outside of China, as well as external public cloud clients, Yu said.He declined to disclose details about potential clients. But cash-strapped startups generally rely heavily on cloud service providers to power their services. Alibaba has invested in several U.S. firms including messaging app Tango, online retailers 11Main.com, Fanatics.com and Shoprunner, but it's unclear if they would avail themselves of Aliyun's services.Ahead of Wednesday's launch, Aliyun ran an invitation-only trial period for customers in China with international expansion plans, he said. The company began selling U.S. cloud services on Tuesday.""Gradually we will start to attract international customers,"" Yu said. ""There are actually lots of U.S. customers, U.S. enterprises who look forward to setting up lots of data centers in China to serve their Chinese-based customers.""""I do see there is big demand for U.S. customers who look for balanced presence of their IT infrastructure across the world, including China.""

657,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft is working on an advanced version of its competitor to Apple's Siri, using research from an artificial intelligence project called ""Einstein.""    Microsoft has been running its ""personal assistant"" Cortana on its Windows phones for a year, and will put the new version on the desktop with the arrival of Windows 10 this autumn. Later, Cortana will be available as a standalone app, usable on phones and tablets powered by Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iOS and Google Inc's (GOOG.O) Android, people familiar with the project said.    ""This kind of technology, which can read and understand email, will play a central role in the next roll out of Cortana, which we are working on now for the fall time frame,"" said Eric Horvitz, managing director of Microsoft Research and a part of the Einstein project, in an interview at the company's Redmond, Washington, headquarters. Horvitz and Microsoft declined comment on any plan to take Cortana beyond Windows.      The plan to put Cortana on machines running software from rivals such as Apple and Google, as well as the Einstein project, have not been reported. Cortana is the name of an artificial intelligence character in the video game series ""Halo.""    They represent a new front in CEO Satya Nadella's battle to sell Microsoft software on any device or platform, rather than trying to force customers to use Windows. Success on rivals' platforms could create new markets and greater relevance for the company best known for its decades-old operating system.    The concept of 'artificial intelligence' is broad, and mobile phones and computers already show dexterity with spoken language and sifting through emails for data, for instance.     Still, Microsoft believes its work on speech recognition, search and machine learning will let it transform its digital assistant into the first intelligent 'agent' which anticipates users needs. By comparison, Siri is advertised mostly as responding to requests. Google's mobile app, which doesn’t have a name like Siri or Cortana, already offers some limited predictive information 'cards' based on what it thinks the user wants to know.    Microsoft has tried to create digital assistants before, without success. Microsoft Bob, released in 1995, was supposed to make using a computer easy, but ended up being the butt of jokes. The Office Assistant nicknamed 'Clippy' suffered a similar fate a few years later.    ""We're defining the competitive landscape... of who can provide the most supportive services that make life easier, keep track of things, that complement human memory in a way that helps us get things done,"" said Horvitz.     Outside his door stands ""The Assistant"", a monitor showing a woman's face that can converse with visitors, has access to Horvitz's calendar and can book meetings.      On his desktop, Horvitz runs 'Lifebrowser', a program that stores everything from appointments to photos and uses machine learning to identify the important moments. A keyword search for his university professor instantly brings up photos and video from the last time they met.    Cortana could tell a mobile phone user when to leave for the airport, days after it read an email and realized the user was planning a flight. It would automatically check flight status, determine where the phone is located using GPS, and checking traffic conditions.    None of the individual steps are a breakthrough, but creating an artificial intelligence that can stitch together the processes marks a breakthrough in usefulness, Microsoft says.     Rivals are on the same track. Google's latest mobile app uses the predictive power generated from billions of searches to work out what a user is doing, what they are interested in, and sending relevant information, such as when a favorite sports team is playing next.    Apple is also pushing Siri, which uses Microsoft's Bing search engine in the background, into new areas with its CarPlay and HomeKit platforms, as well as the recently unveiled Apple Watch.     The key to Cortana's success will be knowing where a user is, what time it is, and what they are trying to do. Albert Einstein's work on the relationship between space and time gave rise to Microsoft's secret project name, said Horvitz.    ""Einstein was brilliant about space and time,"" he said. ""It’s using brilliance about space and time generally in our agents.""

659,"   By Paul Lienert | DETROIT, March 17  DETROIT, March 17 Ford Motor Co is turning to one of its early technology partners, Microsoft Corp , to help expand the automaker's connected car services.Among the features that Ford plans to offer later this year through its new Service Delivery Network is the ability to automatically update its new Sync 3 infotainment system wirelessly. The service will run on Microsoft's cloud-based Azure platform.Ford's cloud-based service will enable the company to gather more data about how owners use their vehicles, according to Don Butler, executive director of connected vehicle and services.That data, Butler said, ""will increase our ability to understand the user experience inside the vehicle . . . with the informed permission of customers."" Butler said the vehicle data that Ford acquires wirelessly through the cloud could be used to remotely diagnose mechanical problems or alert owners and dealers on scheduled maintenance. It could also provide insurers with information about vehicle usage and owners' driving habits.Ford two years ago shifted from Microsoft to BlackBerry Ltd's QNX to help it develop the software for Sync 3, after earlier versions of Sync and MyFord Touch, jointly developed with Microsoft, were troubled by technical glitches and widespread consumer complaints. The Sync 3 system, unveiled last December, will begin appearing this fall on some 2016 Ford models. Ford's cloud network also will enable the company to integrate a broader array of mobile services both inside and away from the vehicle, Butler said.Where manufacturers in the past received much of their revenue from the sale or lease of vehicles, a rapidly evolving business model that encompasses such services as car sharing and pay-per-use rentals has expanded the definition of mobility, Butler said. ""There will be revenues associated with that,"" he said, adding that third-party developers ""may come up with new ways to leverage the data and create new opportunities to deliver services"" to vehicle users.Butler declined to say whether Ford is developing a concierge/communication service similar to General Motors Co's  OnStar. But he said Ford's new partnership with Microsoft ""positions us to be able to deliver a broad set of connectivity-related services.""Ford is not the first automaker to use the Azure platform. Four years ago, Microsoft and Toyota Motor Corp  announced a cloud-services partnership around Azure. And in 2013, a similar deal was struck with Qoros, a unit of China's Chery Automobile Co.

Customers can use the apps free of charge but must pay for premium features. The companies said in February the new Samsung Galaxy S6 phone would be pre-installed with some Microsoft apps. In the past, Microsoft preferred to pair its lucrative Office applications with its ubiquitous Windows operating system, but with the rise of mobile computing, Microsoft has been working hard to make its software available to users of Apple Inc's iOS and Google's Android, which dominate the tablet and smartphone markets.(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Richard Chang)",2015-03-23,MSFT,"Mon Mar 23, 2015 | 12:52pm EDT",Samsung to pre-install Microsoft apps on Android tablets,http://www.reuters.com//article/microsoft-samsung-idUSL2N0WP17I20150323?type=companyNews,0.431,0.027,0.931,0.042
668,"   By Alexei Oreskovic | SAN FRANCISCO, March 27  SAN FRANCISCO, March 27 Yahoo Inc and Microsoft Corp agreed to extend by 30 days the deadline to re-negotiate a ten year search deal, as the two Internet companies attempt to revamp a thorny partnership crafted by former chief executives.The search partnership, which took effect in 2010, allowed the companies to negotiate changes or to terminate the arrangement entirely after five years. Under the terms of the deal, the companies had 30 days to make changes following Feb. 23.According to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, Yahoo and Microsoft mutually agreed to extend that deadline to a 60-day period following Feb. 23. ""We value our partnership with Microsoft and continue discussions about plans for the future. We have nothing further to announce at this time,"" Yahoo said in a statement.Microsoft declined to comment. It was not immediately clear if the extension signaled progress or lack of consensus between Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.The announcement to extend the talks comes a few days after Nadella's mother passed away in Hyderabad, India, according to a report in The Economic Times. Yahoo and Microsoft began a 10-year search partnership in 2010, in a deal crafted by former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and former Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz. The two companies hoped their combined efforts could mount a more competitive challenge to Google Inc, the world's No. 1 search engine.The partnership has not lived up to expectations. Google still controls roughly two-thirds of the U.S. search market, while Microsoft and Yahoo's combined share of the market is essentially unchanged at roughly 30 percent.Yahoo's Mayer, who joined Yahoo in 2012 and who has been critical of the deal in the past, tried to hold off on adopting Microsoft search technology in certain markets in 2013. A court ruled at the time that Yahoo must use Microsoft's search technology.

669,"  SEATTLE, April 2 Microsoft Corp said on Thursday it is bringing one of its most popular apps, which lets people take photos of a document and turn it into a editable file, to Apple Inc's iPhone and Google Inc's  Android.The app, called Office Lens, is already available on phones running Windows, but has had little exposure given Windows' minute share of the smartphone market. Bringing the app to iOS and Android is the latest sign of Microsoft's new strategy of putting its best software on as many devices as possible, regardless of whether they are running Windows. Office Lens essentially turns a phone into a scanner, using the camera to take a photo of a menu, receipt or business card, for example, and instantly cropping the image and storing it in Microsoft's OneNote note-taking app, or OneDrive cloud storage app. The app, which is free to download on both iOS and Android phones as of Thursday, can save an image as a Word file, PowerPoint presentation or PDF file, and uses optical character recognition to make the text searchable and ready for editing.

Microsoft sued Motorola in 2010, alleging Motorola breached its commitment to license some of its industry standard patents on fair terms. After a 2012 trial, a Seattle federal judge found that the appropriate rate for Motorola to license certain wireless and video technology used in the Xbox game console was only a fraction of what Motorola had asked for.Google sold the Motorola handset business to Lenovo last year, but kept its patents. The value of Google's patents can affect how it negotiates royalty rates with other tech companies, and firms including Apple Inc and Intel Corp filed court papers supporting Microsoft.  After the 2012 trial before U.S. District Judge James Robart, the judge said the appropriate royalty rate was about $1.8 million, slightly above Microsoft's estimate, but well below Motorola's demand for as much as $4 billion a year.Google asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday to rule that the patent rate should have been determined by a jury, not the judge. However, all three members of the 9th Circuit panel suggested that Google's attorneys had not sought a jury trial on that issue at the time.  ""It seems pretty clear...that both parties anticipated a bench trial,"" Chief Judge Sidney Thomas said. After Robart set the patent rate, a jury in 2013 awarded Microsoft about $14.5 million in damages for breach of contract in a subsequent trial. Google has asked that the 9th Circuit reverse that award as well.

677,"  SYDNEY, April 8 Global tech giants Google , Apple and Microsoft are ""under review"" by the Australian Tax Office (ATO), senior executives said on Wednesday, as politicians grilled them about corporate tax avoidance.The review means the tax office has not renewed agreements with the companies on transfer pricing, an accounting practice blamed for helping large companies minimise their tax bills, the executives told a Senate hearing in Sydney.Developed nations are trying to crack down on tax loopholes that allow multinational companies to shift their profits from high tax countries to more relaxed regimes.Australia is following the lead of Britain and the United States in holding a public inquiry into corporate tax avoidance, although the company executives declined to provide full details about their financial structures.Google Australia's Managing Director Maile Carnegie, Apple's Australia and New Zealand head Tony King and Microsoft tax executive Bill Sample all declined to say what proportion of their income was taxed in Australia and how much of it they moved overseas, if at all. ""It's pretty alarming that some of you would come to an inquiry like this without basic information about where the revenue is going and where the Australian sales are going,"" said Sam Dastyari, the Senate Inquiry's chair.All thee executives denied though that they avoided tax. ""We haven't shifted any profits,"" said Apple's King.Carnegie and Sample told the inquiry that they booked most of the revenue from their Australian business in Singapore, while King said Apple Australia booked its revenues and sales locally. In their submissions to the Senate committee, both Google and Apple called for Australia to participate in the 'base erosion and profit shifting' plan that was discussed at the meeting of the Group of 20 countries in Australia last year.The G20 has agreed to develop stricter rules on cross-border taxation to close loopholes that have allowed companies such as Starbucks Corp, Google and Apple to avoid paying taxes.Those providing evidence to the inquiry later this week include mining giants BHP Billiton  and Rio Tinto, as well as corporate regulators.

680,"   By Bill Rigby | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Corp emanated an air of quiet satisfaction on Wednesday as European antitrust regulators readied charges against rival Google Inc for abusing its monopoly power in the online search business. The software giant, one of the leading complainants against Google in the EU, has been pushing for closer regulatory scrutiny on its online rival for years both in public and behind the scenes.Long-time staffers at Microsoft, still scarred from its own battles with U.S. and European regulators over the last two decades, did not express sympathy for Google facing a similar process. ""They have to go through what they have to go through,"" said one Microsoft general manager, who was closely involved in the company's public relations at the time of Microsoft's antitrust trial against the U.S. Department of Justice, which started in late 1998 and dragged on until early 2000.The judge in that trial found that Microsoft abused its Windows monopoly by forcing PC makers to bundle its Internet Explorer browser with its operating system. But his proposed remedy of splitting Microsoft into two parts was later overturned and the parties agreed to settle in 2001. To add in some irony, one of the key agitators for the U.S. Justice Department to prosecute Microsoft for abusing its Windows monopoly in the 1990s was Novell CEO Eric Schmidt, now the executive chairman of Google.""What goes around comes around, eh?"" said one former senior Microsoft executive, who remembers the effects of the extended skirmish with the Justice Department. Microsoft's official position on the EU's proposed action against Google was not inflammatory, but it welcomed the scrutiny. ""Today’s decision provides to Google a full opportunity to explain its views at a hearing, and the Commission will then have the opportunity to decide whether European legal rules have been respected,"" a Microsoft spokesman said in an emailed statement.Microsoft has said Google makes it hard for its own Bing search engine to access Google's YouTube and refuses to share advertisers' data with Bing, among other anti-competitive practices. Even as it appears that such issues will now get wider attention, several Microsoft staffers said on Wednesday that it was ""business as usual"" at its campus in Redmond, Washington, and not a day for celebration. That may be a reflection of the fact that many of the younger workers at Microsoft do not remember the antitrust tribulations 15 years ago, and also that the culture has changed in the past year.Former CEO Steve Ballmer was known for his pugnacious dislike of Google, whereas his successor Satya Nadella, who took over 14 months ago, has made smoothing relations with Silicon Valley rivals a key theme of his tenure.""People here are focused on a fairer market,"" said another Microsoft staffer.

While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc's first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon's upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T's proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's new CEO, is charged with reviving the company's falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M's first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy.Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google's future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again.Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street's expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world's largest social network's business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company's next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company's outlook for the remainder of 2015.On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices.On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines. Analysts and investors will be looking out for any details on the tax-free sale of its Alibaba shares.General Motors Co reports first-quarter results before the market opens on Thursday. Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before.On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts' average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer's flagship smartphone.

Many Office users have waited months for Microsoft to introduce the apps, which adapt their look and commands to the device being used, whether Windows Phone or tablet. Microsoft, in a departure from tradition, has already released similar touch-friendly Office apps for Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPad and iPhone, and for tablets running Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android.

691,"  (Adds details on volume, quote, Google, Amazon, Microsoft up after the bell)     * Nasdaq tops March 10, 2000, high of 5,048.62     * S&P 500 hits intraday record high     * Indexes: Dow up 0.11 pct, S&P up 0.24 pct, Nasdaq up 0.41 pct      By Caroline Valetkevitch     April 23 The Nasdaq Composite, the U.S. market index most closely associated with technology stocks, closed at an all-time high on Thursday, surpassing a 2000 record set just before the dotcom crash.     Its new record close of 5,056.06 capped a slow, unsteady climb since it touched a 2002 low of 1,114.11, that spanned an economic recession, the rise of biotech and social media and the explosive growth of mobile phones that has helped make Apple Inc  the most valuable company in the United States.     The Nasdaq traded as high as 5,073.091 on Thursday, led by shares of Apple, which has been among the biggest positive influences on the index in recent years. The index's last record close of 5,048.62 was hit on March 10, 2000.     The benchmark S&P 500 index also set an intraday high, but closed shy of a new record.     Rapid growth in biotechnology companies such as Gilead Sciences Inc and social media firms like Facebook Inc , driven by the popularity of mobile computing, also helped lift the Nasdaq to its current levels.     Strategists say there is still room for the Nasdaq to rise.     ""Now that it's making a new high, I don't think it's just going to stop. It has the potential to go up, absent some external event that I can't predict. I think the companies look as though they ought to power through this environment,"" said Walter Price, senior portfolio manager and managing director of the AllianzGI Global Technology fund in San Francisco.      In 2000, ""a lot of the high-growth companies were selling at 200 or 300 times next year's earnings. This is nothing like that. This is a whole different world versus 2000.""     On Thursday, shares of Gilead were up 1 percent at $105.21, while Facebook, which late Wednesday posted quarterly revenue that missed analysts estimates, was down 2.6 percent at $82.41.     Shares of Apple were up 0.8 percent at $129.67, while Google Inc was up 1.5 percent at $557.46. They are the two top components by market cap in the Nasdaq. Microsoft Corp , which was the top component in March 2000, is now third, followed by Facebook.      The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.42 points, or 0.11 percent, to end at 18,058.69, the S&P 500 gained 4.97 points, or 0.24 percent, to 2,112.93 and the Nasdaq Composite added 20.89 points, or 0.41 percent, to 5,056.06.     After the close, Nasdaq 100 e-mini futures jumped as Google, Microsoft and Amazon.com reported results. Google shares were up 3.7 percent after the bell, while Microsoft was up 3.1 percent and Amazon was up 7.4 percent.     The Nasdaq shed 78.4 percent of its value from the 2000 peak to its 2002 low 31 months later. From the March 2009 trough to today's record, the index gained 300 percent.     The Nasdaq Composite's market capitalization is $8.2 trillion, compared with a $19.5 trillion market cap for the S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Nasdaq's market cap was at $6.6 trillion in March 2000.                  ""It shows the strength in technology and biotechnology and the M&A going on in both those areas, but especially in biotech,"" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, New York.     Though the Nasdaq is heavily associated with technology, the S&P 500 technology sector is actually down about 21 percent since March 10, 2000, according to S&P-Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt.     On Thursday, eight of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher.     Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 2,039 to 956, for a 2.13-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,659 issues rose and 1,061 fell, for a 1.56-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.     About 6.6 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, compared with the daily average of 6.2 billion for the month to date, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

692,"  The Nasdaq's alter ego, the PowerShares QQQ fund, has been the go-to exchange-traded fund for individual investors, pension funds, foreign insurers, sovereign wealth funds, and just about anyone else who has ever had the desire to tap technology sector growth for a quick trade or a long hold.The QQQ exchange-traded fund, often called the ""Cubes"" or the ""Qs,"" tracks the Nasdaq 100, the index of the biggest 100 non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq and is a proxy for the much broader Nasdaq Composite Index. It currently has about $40 billion in assets.Here is a look at how it got so big.* Since its 1999 launch with fewer than $15 million in assets, the QQQ has grown 2,645-fold in assets, making it larger now than the entire U.S. ETF industry was then. It is the sixth-largest U.S.-listed ETF in the $2 trillion ETF market.* The fund started as a side project for a handful of Nasdaq employees seeking to bring mom-and-pop investors into the dotcom boom, but it is now widely held by many large long-term investors, including the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Japan's Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance Co Ltd. * QQQ continues to attract day traders with its strong liquidity, ranking seventh among all ETFs for its 60-day average trading volume. Its typical penny bid/ask spread was barely affected last year, when a single Middle Eastern sovereign fund pulled $10 billion out of the fund, according to John Jacobs, founding father of the QQQ and a former Nasdaq executive who retired in January.* The fund tends to turn in more extreme performances on both the upside and the downside than Nasdaq composite, perhaps because it is composed of the influential stocks atop the broader index. Between the composite index's peak on March 10, 2000 and its trough on Oct. 10, 2002, the benchmark index fell 78.4 percent, while the QQQ declined 83.6 percent between its respective peak on March 24, 2000 and trough on Oct.8, 2002. In the long run up since their respective troughs through Thursday,  the Cubes fund has gone up 454.2 percent and the composite index 356.2 percent. * Shorting activity has come down quite a bit over the past few years, with an average daily quantity on loan of 11.1 million shares from the end of 2011 to this year - about a third of the average daily 32.9 million shares on loan during the period from the end of 2009 to 2011.* Invesco PowerShares is now the QQQ's sponsor, a role it took over in 2007 from Nasdaq, which continues to license its Nasdaq-100 index for the fund's use. And while the fund was initially listed on the American Stock Exchange, it later moved to the Nasdaq Stock Market in 2004, at which point its ticker changed to ""QQQQ."" The ticker reverted back to ""QQQ"" in 2011 after a change in symbology practices, allowing Nasdaq to have tickers with fewer than four characters. * The QQQ has become less of a tech fund and more of a mainstream large-cap fund over the years: Today about 40 percent of the ETF is in consumer discretionary, healthcare and consumer staples companies. But it remains top-heavy in tech, with Apple Inc its biggest holding, accounting for 14.5 percent of the fund by itself. Other top holdings are Microsoft Corp and Google Inc.* The fund bigfoots the 14 other Nasdaq-related ETFs, accounting for 77 percent of the $52 billion they all hold together, according to ETF.com data. Even with its net expense ratio set at a low 0.2 percent of assets, it generates some $80 million in fees annually for its trustee the Bank of New York Mellon, Nasdaq and Invesco, which markets the fund and pays ALPS Distributors Inc, a flat fee each year to distribute it.For a graphic of the Nasdaq Composite Index reaching its peak, please see: link.reuters.com/byg24w (Reporting by Ashley Lau in New York; Editing by Linda Stern, David Gregorio and Nick Zieminski)",2015-04-23,MSFT,"Thu Apr 23, 2015 | 5:29pm EDT",Factbox: Nasdaq's 'Cubes' ETF reaps Nasdaq's big run,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-nasdaq-record-qqq-factbox-idUSKBN0NE2NQ20150423?type=companyNews,0.984,0.014,0.92,0.065

704,"   By Bill Rigby  Microsoft Corp on Thursday reported revenue and profit above Wall Street expectations, as sales of its hardware and cloud-computing services helped to offset a decline in the company's core Windows business. Shares rose 3.1 percent to $44.70 in after-hours trading. ""The company beat across the board,"" said FBR Capital markets analyst Daniel Ives. ""The Street will cheer these results as it appears Microsoft is back on the right track after a head-scratching performance last quarter.""Sales of Windows to computer manufacturers to install on new PCs fell 19 percent in the quarter, reflecting a sharp dip from a year ago when Windows got a brief boost from consumers rushing to buy new machines after Microsoft stopped support for the 14-year-old XP operating system. That decline was offset by higher revenue from its Surface tablet, back-end server software and cloud-related offerings such as its online Office 365 suite of applications.The company said its commercial cloud-related revenue for the quarter more than doubled, and was now running at $6.3 billion a year. Amazon.com Inc said on Thursday its quarterly cloud revenue rose almost 50 percent to $1.57 billion, suggesting a similar annual number.  Microsoft's overall revenue rose 6 percent to $21.7 billion, above Wall Street's average forecast of $21.1 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Taking out the effects of the strong U.S. dollar on currency rates, Microsoft said revenue would have risen 9 percent. Earnings per share declined to 61 cents per share from 68 cents in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had expected 51 cents, on average.

705,"   By Bill Rigby and Nandita Bose | SAN FRANCISCO/CHICAGO  SAN FRANCISCO/CHICAGO Amazon.com Inc surprised investors on Thursday by disclosing for the first time that it makes a profit from its fast-growing cloud-computing business. Microsoft, its closest rival in that arena, also touted a fast-growing cloud business, but held back on key numbers, leaving investors with as many questions as answers. Analysts honed in on Azure, Microsoft's cloud-computing platform, in a conference call on Thursday after earnings, but Microsoft executives avoided specific answers. ""The lack of disclosure on Azure profitability is conspicuous by its absence,"" said Todd Lowenstein, a portfolio manager at HighMark Capital. Amazon's disclosures ""will put pressure on Microsoft to disclose more and lift up the kimono."" Amazon said on Thursday its Amazon Web Services operation - which sells computing power, storage and other services on its own servers - took in $1.57 billion in revenue in the quarter and profit of $265 million, indicating a 17 percent operating profit margin, above most investors' assumptions.Microsoft said only that revenue from Azure - which provides similar services to AWS but is also a much broader platform - was growing. It did say that total commercial cloud revenue, which includes online versions of its Office and Dynamics applications, more than doubled, and is now running at a rate of $6.3 billion in revenue per year.  One analyst asked Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella if Amazon's cloud profitability set a benchmark for Microsoft, but he did not bite. ""I don't think the comparison between Azure and AWS is true for me,"" said Nadella. He suggested that Azure's broader range of services meant the margins on Microsoft's cloud business were more of a mix, without giving any specifics.  Microsoft may have more time than Amazon to show a profit from the cloud, given that the world's largest software company is already highly profitable from its traditional lines of business. Amazon, which only fitfully yields an overall profit from its massive online retail business, has been under much greater scrutiny to provide details on its cloud unit.""There was more pressure for Amazon to do that versus Microsoft, given their model,"" said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. ""The Street is laser-focused on top-line growth for the coming year and for Nadella the focus should be on cloud growth and Windows 10.""

712,"   By Bill Rigby | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is making it easier for apps written for rival Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) Android and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iOS systems to work on Windows phones, in a bid to attract users to its unpopular mobile devices, the company's operating systems chief said on Wednesday.The move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps.Microsoft has found itself in a circular trap, as many developers will not build apps for Windows phones which have few users, and few people want the phones which have fewer apps than Android or Apple phones.Getting apps built for Android and iOS onto its phones and tablets could be a shortcut to breaking out of that trap. ""Microsoft is making a major play to win back developers,"" said Forrester analyst Michael Facemire. ""They’ve opened up the once-impenetrable castle walls."" Speaking at Microsoft's developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, Executive Vice President Terry Myerson said developers will be able to use the vast majority of their Android code to turn their apps into Windows-compatible versions, which will work on Windows phones running a special subsystem. The apps will technically be Windows apps and available only through Microsoft's online app store. The apps would automatically use Microsoft's services such as Bing maps, rather than Google's services, as an app would on an Android phone. That is a crucial distinction because Google gets revenue from ads on services rather than from the Android system itself.  Myerson also announced a surprise move to make it easier for iOS developers to make Windows apps, saying that Microsoft's developer software will be compatible with Objective C, the main programming language used by Apple. Google declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Microsoft, which bought Nokia's handset business last year, has only 3 percent of the global smartphone market. By contrast, Android phones, led by Samsung (005930.KS), control 81 percent of the market and Apple 15 percent, according to Strategy Analytics. Microsoft is scheduled to release its new Windows 10 operating system this summer, which for the first time will run across PCs, tablets and phones.

713,"  (Adds details on how apps will work, analyst comment)By Bill RigbySAN FRANCISCO, April 29 Microsoft Corp  is making it easier for apps written for rival Google Inc's  Android and Apple Inc's iOS systems to work on Windows phones, in a bid to attract users to its unpopular mobile devices, the company's operating systems chief said on Wednesday.The move marks a radical shift in strategy for the world's biggest software company, which still dominates the personal computer market but has failed to get any real traction on tablets and phones, partly because of a lack of apps.Microsoft has found itself in a circular trap, as many developers will not build apps for Windows phones which have few users, and few people want the phones which have fewer apps than Android or Apple phones. Getting apps built for Android and iOS onto its phones and tablets could be a shortcut to breaking out of that trap.""Microsoft is making a major play to win back developers,"" said Forrester analyst Michael Facemire. ""They've opened up the once-impenetrable castle walls.""Speaking at Microsoft's developer conference in San Francisco on Wednesday, Executive Vice President Terry Myerson said developers will be able to use the vast majority of their Android code to turn their apps into Windows-compatible versions, which will work on Windows phones running a special subsystem. The apps will technically be Windows apps and available only through Microsoft's online app store. The apps would automatically use Microsoft's services such as Bing maps, rather than Google's services, as an app would on an Android phone. That is a crucial distinction because Google gets revenue from ads on services rather than from the Android system itself.Myerson also announced a surprise move to make it easier for iOS developers to make Windows apps, saying that Microsoft's developer software will be compatible with Objective C, the main programming language used by Apple. Google declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Microsoft, which bought Nokia's handset business last year, has only 3 percent of the global smartphone market.

723,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Chuck Robbins, the veteran salesman chosen by Cisco Systems Inc to succeed legendary CEO John Chambers, must prove he has the technical knowledge to chart a new course and lead the network equipment maker into the new world of cloud-based computing. Cisco, like tech stalwarts Hewlett-Packard Co and IBM, is trying to branch out from its core business into software, security and datacenters to capitalize on the explosion of remote computing. ""He's going to run the company well as a caretaker, he's got good business acumen, said Glenn O'Donnell, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester ""The question is whether he has vision.  I don't think anybody yet knows the answer."" Cisco is the clear market leader in selling network equipment to companies, controlling about half of a $38 billion global market, more than four times the total of the next two rivals combined, HP and China's Huawei, according to Gartner.The company is now trying to break away from being type-cast as just a network equipment supplier, laying its bets on what it calls the ""Internet of Everything"", basically the recognition that soon almost every person, device, or sensor will feed data into a network. Cisco aims to play a role in analyzing and channeling that traffic in as many places as possible.  ""They are making all this noise about the 'Internet of Everything'. That's a nice ambitious vision, but how can Cisco capitalize on that, and win in that marketplace?,"" asked O'Donnell.Robbins, 49, gave no clear indication of his strategy during a conference call with reporters on Monday, saying he would rather listen to customers and shareholders for the next 90 days before laying out his plan.The CEO-in-waiting, who takes over in late July, made his name at Cisco building relationships with the legion of companies that actually sell Cisco's products to large businesses, making up about 80 percent of Cisco's $49 billion in expected revenue this fiscal year.  That makes Robbins, who holds a bachelor's degree in mathematics with a concentration in computer science from the University of North Carolina, a consummate salesman, like his predecessor.Chambers and Robbins, who joked together on a conference call earlier on Monday, are ""cut of the same cloth"", said Tim Zimmerman, an analyst at Gartner. ""He's very sales focused, similar to John, and understands the voice of the customer,"" he added.  Cisco needs a leader to take the big picture and dismantle the ""silo"" approach to selling many, sometimes competing, products to clients, said Zimmerman. ""Is he the right person? Time will always tell.""Some Wall Street analysts voiced reservations that Robbins had the deep knowledge of technology necessary to succeed.""While we like Chuck Robbins individually, we believe investors would benefit more from technology leadership at the company given the disruptive changes we believe are coming to networking,"" said Rod Hall, an analyst at JP Morgan.

732,"   By Nadia Damouni  Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) currently is not weighing an offer for Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N), two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday, dampening speculation that Microsoft could be drawn into bidding for the cloud software company.Bloomberg News, citing people with knowledge of the matter, reported earlier this week that Microsoft was evaluating a bid for Salesforce after the latter was approached by another unnamed would-be buyer.Microsoft considers Salesforce's current market valuation  expensive, one of the people said. It is possible that Microsoft could review a bid for Salesforce in the long term, the other person said.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.Microsoft and Salesforce both declined to comment. San Francisco-based Salesforce is No. 1 in the $23 billion-a-year customer relationship management (CRM) market, according to tech research firm Gartner. It helps corporations organize and track sales calls and leads.Salesforce's services are entirely provided over the cloud, with no software directly installed on PCs. Oracle (ORCL.N) and Microsoft, which were relatively late to the cloud model, have much smaller online CRM revenues.As a result, Microsoft and several other big software companies are seeking to beef up their presence in cloud computing. Yet any deal for Salesforce, which has a market capitalization of $49 billion, would be pricey. Salesforce's shares, which have risen 48 percent in the last 12 months, trade at 106.8 times the company's forward earnings, well above Microsoft's multiple of 19.1, according to Thomson Reuters data.Last month, Oracle Chief Executive Safra Catz said her company could benefit if Microsoft or another rival bought Salesforce.com. ""It would cause a lot of disruption in that market and so I would view that as something that would be helpful to us, especially in the short or medium term, dependent on who it was,"" Catz said. She declined to comment on whether Oracle had made an approach to buy Salesforce.Another potential buyer for Salesforce has ruled itself out. SAP SE (SAPG.DE) Chief Executive Bill McDermott said earlier this week his company has ""zero interest"" in its software rival. ""We have never bought something that was impaired and in decline,"" he said, saying that Salesforce's cloud computing software was becoming commoditized.

736,"  (Repeats for additional subscribers)By Bill RigbySEATTLE May 20 Microsoft's plan to make its new version of Windows a mobile hit by letting it accept tweaked Apple and Android apps has met an obstacle: some of the software developers the company needs to woo just aren't interested.Windows phones accounted for just 3 percent of global smartphone sales last year, compared with about 81 percent for devices with Google's Android system and 15 percent for Apple and its iOS system, according to research firm IDC. One reason is that Windows doesn't run as many or as attractive apps as its rivals.To boost sales of its phones and new operating system, Microsoft said last month that it would provide tools to software developers to make it easier to design apps for Windows based on apps that run on Android or Apple. But because so few people use a Windows phone, most developers remain focused on the more popular systems and don't see a need to develop apps for Windows. They also said they doubt how easy the new tools will be to use.""Windows phone will have to gain a significant share of the market before this becomes something that saves us time and/or money,"" said Sean Orelli, a director at app development firm Fuzz Productions in New York, which makes apps related to Citibank, the New York Post, and Conde Nast, among others.For Microsoft, the world's biggest software company, there's a lot at stake this summer as it rolls out Windows 10, the first operating system designed to run on PCs, tablets and phones. If developers don't embrace the new platform, it will seriously damage the prospects of the new operating system, which Microsoft hopes will power one billion devices in two or three years.CANDY CRUSH Interviews with more than a dozen developers found just one planning to move an app from Apple or Android to Microsoft . That's King.com, which ported its popular Candy Crush Saga game from iOS to Windows 10 ""with very few code modifications"" and will be installed automatically with upgrades to Windows 10, according to Microsoft. King.com confirmed the move but declined to comment further.Eight developers said they aren't planning to develop for Windows 10 at all. Four who already have Windows apps said they would continue to do so.Because Microsoft hasn't actually unveiled its new set of tools to turn apps into a Windows format, developers did not rule out any move, and a Microsoft spokesman said that ""it is still early"" and many software companies want to explore the tools over the coming months. More and better apps might attract more people to buy a Windows phone or tablet, Microsoft reasons. Only six of the top 10 free apps on iPhone are available for Windows phone, and of those, two are made by Microsoft itself. In the past Microsoft has paid developers to create Windows apps.Failure to attract the apps would not be fatal for Microsoft, which is growing more reliant on its Office, server software and cloud computing services, but it would be a sign that Microsoft is losing its hold on personal computing, in a world where phones are expected to outsell PCs by more than six to one by 2017.Because of that trend, ""it's going to be hard for developers to prioritize building for Microsoft,"" said John Milinovich, Chief Executive of URX, a mobile ad service that creates links between apps.STATIC BUSINESS  Windows, closely tied to the stagnant PC market, is a big but static business for Microsoft. It's likely worth $20 billion in revenue this fiscal year, analysts say, compared with almost $30 billion for its Office business, out of total expected annual revenue of $93 billion. The company's server software and cloud-computing businesses are growing much faster, with cloud-computing revenue forecast to triple to $20 billion by 2018.Even though only a handful of developers have been allowed a sneak preview of the new tools Microsoft says it's preparing, most doubt it will be easy to take iOS and Android apps to Windows. Concerns include how the Windows app will use batches of pre-written software, called libraries, that an app needs to run, and the prospects that Apple's new language, called Swift, may soon eclipse the current one.Erik Rucker, head of mobile at Smartsheet, which makes an online tool to manage projects, said he doesn't plan a Windows app version. He doubts tweaking an iPad or iPhone app for Windows would be simple.""We'd end up writing a whole bunch more code,"" to move over an Apple app that was tightly integrated with the device, he said.For Jason Thane, general manager at General UI, a mobile app developer based in Seattle, the cost of developing a Windows app from another system would need to fall to about 10 percent to 20 percent of the cost of building it.""It can cost 50 percent or more of the cost to develop an app on one platform to port it to a new platform,"" said Thane, who hasn't yet used the new tools. ""So if Microsoft has a way for our customers to do it easily and cheaply, and if there's no serious performance or functionality impact, I think they'd have a lot of people wanting to do it."" Even a little extra effort is too much for some smaller developers, including former Microsoft executive Adam Tratt, who now runs Haiku Deck, which makes presentation software primarily designed for iPads.""I'd like to at some point, but we're not working on it yet,"" he said. ""It's a function of resources.""Recent history hasn't been on Microsoft's side. Last year Pinterest pulled its Windows Phone test app, and this year Chase and Bank of America stopped supporting Windows phone apps, saying few customers were affected.

737,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft's plan to make its new version of Windows a mobile hit by letting it accept tweaked Apple and Android apps has met an obstacle: some of the software developers the company needs to woo just aren't interested.Windows phones accounted for just 3 percent of global smartphone sales last year, compared with about 81 percent for devices with Google's Android system and 15 percent for Apple and its iOS system, according to research firm IDC. One reason is that Windows doesn't run as many or as attractive apps as its rivals.To boost sales of its phones and new operating system, Microsoft said last month that it would provide tools to software developers to make it easier to design apps for Windows based on apps that run on Android or Apple. But because so few people use a Windows phone, most developers remain focused on the more popular systems and don't see a need to develop apps for Windows. They also said they doubt how easy the new tools will be to use.""Windows phone will have to gain a significant share of the market before this becomes something that saves us time and/or money,"" said Sean Orelli, a director at app development firm Fuzz Productions in New York, which makes apps related to Citibank, the New York Post, and Conde Nast, among others.For Microsoft, the world's biggest software company, there's a lot at stake this summer as it rolls out Windows 10, the first operating system designed to run on PCs, tablets and phones. If developers don't embrace the new platform, it will seriously damage the prospects of the new operating system, which Microsoft hopes will power one billion devices in two or three years.CANDY CRUSH Interviews with more than a dozen developers found just one planning to move an app from Apple or Android to Microsoft. That's King.com, which ported its popular Candy Crush Saga game from iOS to Windows 10 ""with very few code modifications"" and will be installed automatically with upgrades to Windows 10, according to Microsoft. King.com confirmed the move but declined to comment further.Eight developers said they aren't planning to develop for Windows 10 at all. Four who already have Windows apps said they would continue to do so.Because Microsoft hasn't actually unveiled its new set of tools to turn apps into a Windows format, developers did not rule out any move, and a Microsoft spokesman said that ""it is still early"" and many software companies want to explore the tools over the coming months. More and better apps might attract more people to buy a Windows phone or tablet, Microsoft reasons. Only six of the top 10 free apps on iPhone are available for Windows phone, and of those, two are made by Microsoft itself. In the past Microsoft has paid developers to create Windows apps.Failure to attract the apps would not be fatal for Microsoft, which is growing more reliant on its Office, server software and cloud computing services, but it would be a sign that Microsoft is losing its hold on personal computing, in a world where phones are expected to outsell PCs by more than six to one by 2017.Because of that trend, ""it's going to be hard for developers to prioritize building for Microsoft,"" said John Milinovich, Chief Executive of URX, a mobile ad service that creates links between apps.STATIC BUSINESS  Windows, closely tied to the stagnant PC market, is a big but static business for Microsoft. It's likely worth $20 billion in revenue this fiscal year, analysts say, compared with almost $30 billion for its Office business, out of total expected annual revenue of $93 billion. The company's server software and cloud-computing businesses are growing much faster, with cloud-computing revenue forecast to triple to $20 billion by 2018.Even though only a handful of developers have been allowed a sneak preview of the new tools Microsoft says it's preparing, most doubt it will be easy to take iOS and Android apps to Windows. Concerns include how the Windows app will use batches of pre-written software, called libraries, that an app needs to run, and the prospects that Apple's new language, called Swift, may soon eclipse the current one.Erik Rucker, head of mobile at Smartsheet, which makes an online tool to manage projects, said he doesn't plan a Windows app version. He doubts tweaking an iPad or iPhone app for Windows would be simple.""We'd end up writing a whole bunch more code,"" to move over an Apple app that was tightly integrated with the device, he said.For Jason Thane, general manager at General UI, a mobile app developer based in Seattle, the cost of developing a Windows app from another system would need to fall to about 10 percent to 20 percent of the cost of building it. ""It can cost 50 percent or more of the cost to develop an app on one platform to port it to a new platform,"" said Thane, who hasn't yet used the new tools. ""So if Microsoft has a way for our customers to do it easily and cheaply, and if there's no serious performance or functionality impact, I think they'd have a lot of people wanting to do it.""Even a little extra effort is too much for some smaller developers, including former Microsoft executive Adam Tratt, who now runs Haiku Deck, which makes presentation software primarily designed for iPads.""I'd like to at some point, but we're not working on it yet,"" he said.

740,"   By Abhirup Roy and Anya George Tharakan  Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), which is in the process of splitting itself, forecast separation-related costs below the expectation of several analysts and reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit.The world's No. 2 personal computer maker, whose shares rose more than 3 percent in extended trading on Thursday, kept its profit forecast unchanged for the full year, allaying fears of a strong dollar and weak enterprise demand for its services.The 75-year-old company said it expects $400 million-$450 million of costs from the planned separation of its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.""I thought it could be a little higher than that,"" FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said. There was some excitement about the costs being less than expected, he said.The forecast soothed investor concerns about costs for the breakup in the first year, Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross said. Ongoing cost reductions and HP's focus on higher-margin sales were driving profit, Cross said. Total costs and expenses fell 5.7 percent to $24 billion in the second quarter ended April 30.""I think the Street was expecting higher expenses,"" Seyrafi said.In February, HP — which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenue from outside the United States — forecast full-year earnings well below analysts' estimates, citing a strong dollar. Up to Thursday's close, the dollar .DXY had risen 19 percent against a basket of major currencies in the past year.HP's net income fell to $1.01 billion, or 55 cents per share, from $1.27 billion, or 66 cents per share a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 87 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales across most of HP's product lines fell, dragging its total revenue down 6.8 percent to $25.45 billion. Its enterprise services unit, which accounts for about a fifth of total revenue, suffered the most with a 16 percent drop.The company forecast an adjusted profit of 83-87 cents per share for the third quarter. Analysts were expecting 87 cents.HP also said Cathie Lesjak will become the Chief Financial Officer of HP Inc, while Tim Stonesifer will become the CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

She also said it would take several years to return to normal interest rates. Investors have enjoyed an extended period of low volatility and steady gains, but with the Fed on track to raise rates this year and major indexes near records, the market could get a bit choppier in coming weeks.""I think what Janet Yellen and all of the Fed officials have been doing is very carefully choreographing their move.

746,"   By Abhirup Roy and Anya George Tharakan  Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), which is in the process of splitting itself, forecast separation-related costs below the expectation of several analysts and reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit.The world's No. 2 personal computer maker, whose shares rose more than 3 percent in extended trading on Thursday, kept its profit forecast unchanged for the full year, allaying fears of a strong dollar and weak enterprise demand for its services.The 75-year-old company said it expects $400 million-$450 million of costs from the planned separation of its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.On a conference call, the company said it sees potentially $2 billion in restructuring costs in its Enterprise Services group over three years.The company added it may reduce costs at the two companies by about $1 billion during the same period.""I thought it could be a little higher than that,"" FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said. There was some excitement about the costs being less than expected, he said. The forecast soothed investor concerns about costs for the breakup in the first year, Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross said.Ongoing cost reductions and HP's focus on higher-margin sales were driving profit, Cross said. Total costs and expenses fell 5.7 percent to $24 billion in the second quarter ended April 30.""I think the Street was expecting higher expenses,"" Seyrafi said. In February, HP — which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenue from outside the United States — forecast full-year earnings well below analysts' estimates, citing a strong dollar.Up to Thursday's close, the dollar .DXY had risen 19 percent against a basket of major currencies in the past year.HP's net income fell to $1.01 billion, or 55 cents per share, from $1.27 billion, or 66 cents per share a year earlier.  Excluding items, the company earned 87 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 85 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sales across most of HP's product lines fell, dragging its total revenue down 6.8 percent to $25.45 billion. Its enterprise services unit, which accounts for about a fifth of total revenue, suffered the most with a 16 percent drop.The company forecast an adjusted profit of 83-87 cents per share for the third quarter. Analysts were expecting 87 cents.HP also said Cathie Lesjak will become the Chief Financial Officer of HP Inc, while Tim Stonesifer will become the CFO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

747,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday ruled against Cisco Systems Inc(CSCO.O) over a patent infringement claim the tech giant is fighting.On a 6-2 vote, with Justice Stephen Breyer recused from the case, the court threw out a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in favor of Cisco. There is now likely to be a new trial.The case concerns a patent held by Commil USA LLC on a way to improve the implementation of a wireless network where multiple access points are needed. Commil sued Cisco for patent infringement and induced patent infringement based on the network equipment maker's use of similar technology.In April 2011, a jury awarded Commil almost $63.8 million in damages. A judge subsequently added $10.3 million in interest.In June 2013, the appeals court ordered a retrial, concluding in part that Cisco should be allowed to mount the ""good faith"" defense.The high court ruled in an opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy that Cisco's belief that the patent was invalid was not a legitimate defense. Washington-based intellectual property lawyer William Jackson said the ruling means ""the patent owner must merely prove that the other party knew of the patent and intended to induce infringement - not that the party had any particular belief about validity.""The ruling ""restores common sense to patent litigation,"" said Commil's attorney, Mark Werbner.Seth Waxman, one of Cisco's lawyers, said the ruling ""simply eliminates one of many defenses available to Cisco, which looks forward to retrial of the case.""In a brief filed at the invitation of the high court, the U.S. government had warned that companies accused of inducing patent infringement were likely to raise the ""good faith"" defense in most cases, if not all of them. The court appeared to buy that argument, with Kennedy writing that if Cisco prevailed on its theory, there would be ""negative consequences"" in other cases.""It can render litigation more burdensome for everyone involved,"" Kennedy said of the good faith defense.The case was closely watched by Silicon Valley and biotechnology firms. Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts.Scalia said the ruling would benefit so-called patent trolls, companies that hold patents only for the purpose of suing firms seeking to develop new products.The case is Commil v. Cisco, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 13-896.

749,"  (Adds consumer sentiment, factory data, updates markets)* First-quarter GDP revised down to show contraction* GDP shrinks at a 0.7 percent annual rate* Trade, inventories account for bulk of revision* Strong dollar weighs on Q1 corporate profitsBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, May 29 The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter as it buckled under the weight of unusually heavy snowfalls, a resurgent dollar and disruptions at West Coast ports, but activity already has rebounded modestly.The government on Friday slashed its gross domestic product estimate to show GDP shrinking at a 0.7 percent annual rate instead of the 0.2 percent growth pace it estimated last month.A larger trade deficit and a smaller accumulation of inventories by businesses than previously thought accounted for much of the downward revision. There was also a modest downward revision to consumer spending.With growth estimates for the second quarter currently around 2 percent, the economy appears poised for its worst first-half performance since 2011. The economy's recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis has been erratic.Weak data on consumer sentiment and factory activity in the Midwest on Friday suggested that while the economy has pulled out of its first-quarter soft patch, the growth pace was modest early in the second quarter. That mirrored other recent soft data on retail sales and industrial production.But reports on housing and business spending plans have indicated momentum could be building, which would keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates later this year. Economists caution against reading too much into the slump in output. They argue the GDP figure for the first quarter was held down by a confluence of temporary factors, including a problem with the model the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations.Economists, including those at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, have cast doubts on the accuracy of GDP estimates for the first quarter, which have tended to show weakness over the last several years.They argued the so-called seasonal adjustment is not fully stripping out seasonal patterns, leaving ""residual"" seasonality. The government said last week it was aware of the potential problem and was working to minimize it.""Obviously the economy is weaker than we would like it to be, but the first quarter overstates that,"" said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica in Dallas. ""We're going see enough growth to keep job creation in place and allow the Fed to maintain their lift-off schedule for September.""When measured from the income side, the economy expanded at a 1.4 percent rate in the first quarter. A measure of domestic demand growth was revised up slightly and business spending on equipment was much stronger than previously estimated, taking some edge off the slump in output.U.S. Treasuries were trading higher, while the dollar was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street fell. DOLLAR, ENERGY DRAG Apart from the statistical quirk, the economy, which expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter, was hammered by a sharp decline in investment spending in the energy sector as companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton  responded to the plunge in crude oil prices.Spending on mining exploration, shafts and wells plunged at a 48.6 percent pace in the first quarter, the largest drop since the second quarter of 2009.Economists estimate unusually heavy snowfalls in February chopped at least one percentage point from growth.Trade was hit both by the strong dollar and the ports labor dispute, which weighed on exports through the quarter and then unleashed a flood of imports in March after it was resolved. That resulted in a trade deficit that subtracted 1.90 percentage points from GDP, the largest drag in 31 years, instead of the 1.25 percentage points reported last month.The GDP report also showed after-tax corporate profits declined 8.7 percent. That was the largest drop in a year and the second quarterly fall, as the strong dollar burdened multinational corporations and oil prices hurt domestic firms.Multinationals like Microsoft Corp, household products maker Procter & Gamble Co and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.Unlike 2014, when growth snapped back quickly after a dismal first quarter, the dollar and investment cuts by energy companies continue to hamstring activity.But growth could accelerate as the year progresses.The value of inventory accumulated in the first quarter was revised down to an increase of $95 billion from the lofty $110.3 billion rise reported last month.That meant inventories contributed 0.33 percentage point to GDP instead of the previously reported 0.74 percentage point, suggesting warehouses are not bulging with unwanted merchandise and businesses have latitude to order more goods from factories.While consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised down by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.8 percent rate, it could finally get a lift from the considerable savings households amassed because of cheaper gasoline.Personal savings increased at a robust $726.4 billion pace.""The outlook for the economy is very encouraging,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)",2015-05-29,MSFT,"Fri May 29, 2015 | 11:56am EDT",WRAPUP 4-U.S. economy contracts in Q1; dollar hurts corporate profits,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSLNNTGEBB220150529?type=companyNews,0.0256,0.096,0.803,0.101

Other data showed construction spending surged in April, but consumer spending was unexpectedly flat. The data left investor's with a mixed view about the strength of the economy's recovery from the first-quarter's slump as they try to gauge when the Federal Reserve will ultimately raise interest rates.With little evidence of a rebound, the Fed is in no position to start raising interest rates for the first time since 2006, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said.""We're seeing a lot of counter trends in the market,"" said Rick Fier, director of trading at Conifer Securities in New York.

Those entrepreneurs benefit from Amazon's and Microsoft's diversification beyond their narrow beginnings.""If you go back certainly 10 years, Amazon was an etailer, and Microsoft was Windows and Office,"" Porter said in an interview on Wednesday, referring to the popular software programs. ""Today they're in so many different businesses."" Those newer businesses include entertainment; various infrastructure plays; and the remote data storage that has become known as the ""cloud.""Madrona, then a young venture firm, was an early Amazon investor. Today, it manages $1.3 billion in assets, including high-profile active investments that predate startups spawned by Amazon or Microsoft. Those include Redfin, a real estate company, and Apptio, an analytics company, whose chief executives had not worked at Amazon nor Microsoft before landing at their current ventures.Madrona generally makes seed investments of under $1 million, and follows up with $2 million to $5 million for the next investment stage, generally known as Series A. It reserves additional sums to participate in larger investing rounds for its portfolio companies that continue to grow. Madrona VI added no new institutional investors, something of a rarity in venture capital.

761,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE, June 10  SEATTLE, June 10 Revealing its price tag for the first time, Microsoft Corp will sell a bigger version of its new, wall-mounted video-conferencing and digital whiteboard device for $20,000, making it the most expensive product in its hardware line-up, the software company said on Wednesday.Orders start July 1 for the Surface Hub, which Microsoft hopes will become a fixture in meeting rooms around the world. It will run a custom version of Windows 10, Microsoft's new operating system due out in late July. Deliveries will start in September.Despite the hefty price tag, Microsoft is betting that the Surface Hub will appeal to businesses that are used to spending multiples of that amount on conference room facilities.""The theoretical market may be much bigger than the actual market,"" said JP Gownder, an analyst at tech research firm Forrester. He said the device likely will not be an instant hit with businesses, but should appeal to companies where collaborative work is important, such as product design or marketing and advertising. Integrating video-calling and note-taking onto a touch screen, the Surface Hub traces its roots back to products made by Perceptive Pixel, an Oregon-based company Microsoft bought in 2012. Microsoft unveiled a prototype of the new device in January.It is the latest step in Microsoft's foray into high-tech hardware, starting with the launch of the Surface tablet in 2012 and the purchase of Nokia's handset business last year. An 84-inch screen version will sell for $20,000. A smaller 55-inch version will sell for $7,000.The Surface Hub will ""pay for itself and make money"" said Mike Angiulo, who runs Microsoft's devices group. Angiulo would not reveal how many Surface Hubs are being produced, but said there was a large potential market of millions of conference rooms used by organizations worldwide.There is no clear market segment for the Surface Hub, which blends elements of video conferencing systems such as those made by Cisco Systems Inc and digital whiteboards made by Panasonic Corp and others. The only directly comparable product is the Mondopad, made by InFocus, which is priced slightly lower than Microsoft's offering.The larger Surface Hub model, which is just over 4 inches (10 cm) thick and weighs 280 lbs (127 kg), features the biggest single piece of glass for an electronic product in production, Angiulo said.

767,"  WASHINGTON The U.S. current account deficit widened in the first quarter to its highest level since 2012 likely due to the strong dollar's drag on overseas profits and exports.The Commerce Department said on Thursday the current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, increased 9.9 percent to $113.3 billion. That was the largest shortfall since the second quarter of 2012. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the deficit rising to $117.0 billion. The government revised data going back to the first quarter of 1999.The first-quarter current account deficit represented 2.6 percent of gross domestic product, the highest since the third quarter of 2012, from 2.3 percent in the fourth quarter.  Still, the deficit remained well below a record high of 6.3 percent touched in the fourth quarter of 2005 as strong domestic energy production keeps the import bill in check.The robust dollar has hurt the profits of multinational corporations and is also constraining export growth. The dollar gained about 4.5 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners in the first quarter.  Multinationals like Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), household products maker Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.  In the first quarter, direct investment income receipts from abroad fell $9.1 billion to $109.5 billion. Exports of goods fell 6.5 percent to $382.7 billion.

Baker  Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) said on Tuesday it would buy OpenDNS, a privately held cloud-based security firm, for $635 million, the latest move to boost its security business as cyber attacks increase in number and sophistication.Cisco has been buying a number of security companies, which has made its relatively tiny security business one of its fastest growing areas in the past two years.OpenDNS uses predictive intelligence to block malware, botnets and phishing threats that antivirus and firewalls miss. Cisco was a minority investor and was one of the backers that invested $35 million in OpenDNS in May last year. (bit.ly/1KqDMjV)When Cisco buys stakes in startups, it often receives defensive rights that give it an edge to acquire companies it has invested in ahead of competitors.  The acquisition of OpenDNS is Cisco's first after it said in May that veteran sales executive Chuck Robbins would replace John Chambers as CEO in July. ""M&A will continue to be an important part of what we do,"" said Hilton Romanski, Cisco's chief technology & strategy officer, adding that the M&A strategy of being an active investor and potential acquirer will continue under Robbins. The company, whose security business is known for its firewalls, expanded into intrusion detection and prevention systems with the $2.7 billion acquisition of Sourcefire in 2013.""We're going to continue to focus on deals that allow us to complement what we've done with Sourcefire in the area of intrusion prevention and we'll continue to look at malware and other key verticals inside the security domain,"" Romanski said in an interview.  The global cybersecurity market is estimated to grow to  $170.21 billion by 2020 from $106.32 billion in 2015, according to market research firm MarketsandMarkets.Cisco's shares closed down 8 cents or 0.3 percent Tuesday. Cisco, which has acquired dozens of companies over the years, is transitioning towards high-end switches and routers and investing in new products such as data analytics software and cloud-based tools for data centers. It bought malware analysis company ThreatGRID in 2014 and security advisory firm Neohapsis this year.San Francisco, California-based OpenDNS has partnerships with network gear makers such as Aruba Networks Inc and Netgear Inc (NTGR.O) as well as cybersecurity companies such as FireEye Inc (FEYE.O).

772,"   By Tom Bergin | LONDON  LONDON Monday was the day the music died for thousands of song downloaders and music streamers in Greece.The imposition of capital controls on Sunday evening means Greeks are no longer able to purchase goods or services from many big international online suppliers including Google (GOOGL.O), Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Facebook (FB.O).Transfers of funds out of Greece were banned to prevent a collapse of the banking system after Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras rejected the terms of a bailout offer from international lenders.The controls mean payments via debit or credit cards to accounts outside Greece are prohibited.This is a problem for the big online retailers, music download sellers and airlines, who sell to clients across Europe from centralized transacting subsidiaries, often in Luxembourg or Ireland, and often for tax reasons. Since Monday, many Greeks have found they can no longer make payments online to such companies. ""I tried to pay Facebook three euros for a small advertisement but my card was rejected right away,"" said Greek e-commerce consultant Panayotis Gezerlis.He added that he had also failed to purchase music from Google and to make a payment from his bank card via eBay's (EBAY.O) payment unit, Paypal.Google told Greek clients in a Facebook posting that it was working to find a solution.

775,"   By Bill Rigby | SEATTLE  SEATTLE Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Monday it will hand over its display advertising business to AOL Inc and sell some map-generating technology to ride-hailing app company Uber, as it slims down its money-losing online operations.The moves mean Microsoft will focus on its growing search advertising business based on its Bing search engine, and displaying maps on its Windows devices rather than generating the maps themselves. Microsoft, which employs hundreds of people in its display ad business around the world, said those employees would be offered the chance to transfer to AOL and that it was not making any layoffs. The world's largest software company no longer breaks out results for its online operations, chiefly its MSN web portal and Bing, but they have  lost more than $10 billion over the past five years. Chief Executive Satya Nadella has said Bing will turn a profit next fiscal year.  ""Today’s news is evidence of Microsoft’s increased focus on our strengths: in this case, search and search advertising and building great content and consumer services,"" said Microsoft in a statement.Under a 10-year deal struck with AOL, now a unit of Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), AOL will sell display ads on MSN, Outlook.com, Xbox, Skype and in some apps in major countries. As part of the deal, Bing will become the search engine behind web searches on AOL starting next year.  Microsoft also struck a multi-year extension to its existing deal with AppNexus, which provides the tech platform for buyers to purchase online ads. Microsoft and Uber did not disclose financial terms of their deal, under which Uber will take over the part of Microsoft's  mapping unit that works on imagery acquisition and map data processing. Uber will offer jobs to the 100 or so Microsoft employees working in that area, according to a source familiar with the deal. Fast-growing Uber, which is shaking up established taxi services worldwide, already uses a combination of map services from Google Inc (GOOGL.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and China's Baidu (BIDU.O) and the source said it will continue to do so. Although Microsoft will no longer collect mapping imagery itself, Microsoft said it will continue to work with imagery providers for underlying data on its own maps. Microsoft already gets much of its map data from Finland's Nokia NOK1V.HE.

776,"   By Yasmeen Abutaleb | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Inc's (MSFT.O) future in mobile devices likely hinges on the software maker's ability to convince developers to create apps for the phone version of Windows 10 after its ill-fated Nokia acquisition helped trigger 7,800 layoffs.The job cuts announcement is an acknowledgement that its 2013 $7.2 billion purchase of Nokia was never going to help paltry sales of its Windows Phone, and that it needed a new approach.  Microsoft said it would also write down about $7.6 billion related to its Nokia business. The cuts indicate that Microsoft will likely focus its mobile efforts on its high-stakes Windows 10 software release, due in late July, rather than on developing smartphones, analysts said. The software's apps are supposed to work across desktops, tablets and phones with little tweaking. The company is betting that the popularity of Windows on desktop PCs will lead to more apps for the mobile version of Windows and entice more consumers to buy its phones.  ""This mobile strategy going forward is the best they could possibly do,"" said Forrester analyst J.P. Gownder. Wednesday's announcement is the second round of job cuts since Satya Nadella became chief executive in February 2014. Microsoft said last July it would slash up to 18,000 jobs.Last month, the company struck deals to hand over much of its advertising business to AOL and sell mapping assets to Uber.

785,"   By Anna Ercanbrack | HELSINKI  HELSINKI When U.S. software giant Microsoft bought Nokia's struggling mobile phone business last year, the inhabitants of Salo – a town of 54,000 in southern Finland – thought the move would revive the local economy.But their hopes were crushed last week when Microsoft announced it would close Nokia's former product development unit in the town, putting all 1,100 jobs at risk. Last year the U.S. company had said it could hire more staff in Salo.The decline of Finland's electronics industry as Nokia lost competitiveness against peers Apple and Samsung, along with falling global demand for paper products and EU sanctions on neighboring Russia, have entrenched the Scandinavian country in a three-year recession.Towns like Salo, home to one of Nokia's first factories set up in the 1970s, have been particularly hard hit. Prime Minister Juha Sipila called Microsoft's decision last week ""a big blow,"" and visited Salo on Monday to hear from locals how the government could best help the town.A former engineer and telecoms executive, Sipila was elected in April on a promise to balance Finland's budget, cut bureaucracy and lower taxes for small companies.He has advocated the role of entrepreneurship in getting Finland back on track, but that may be a tough transition for an economy that became so dependent on Nokia.Ten years ago, Nokia’s operations in Salo employed 5,000 people and even in 2008, over a fifth of all jobs in the area were within information technology.  Today Salo's unemployment rate stands at 15 percent, well above the national rate of 9.7 percent, following the closure of a Nokia factory in 2012 and previous Microsoft layoffs. Closing the product development unit could push it up to 20 percent.High unemployment and the angst among Finns about where their country is headed is reflected in the rising popularity of the eurosceptic Finns Party, now a coalition partner, and in Finland's recent tough stance in euro zone negotiations on bailout funds for Greece.Finnish politicians expressed their solidarity with Salo on social media. ""My staff and I have been closely following the death curve,"" said Salo's mayor Antti Rantakokko, referring to the decline in recent years of Windows' share of the global smart phone market to just 2-3 percent.He said some technology companies had been in contact with him about investing in Salo, but would not elaborate.Microsoft, in an emailed statement to Reuters, said that, under its new strategy, the company would cut the range of smart phones it sells and so would not need three development sites in Finland.Two Finnish sites, in Espoo and Tampere, will remain open, but of its 3,200 employees in Finland, only 900 may survive after negotiations between Microsoft and Finnish employees, expected to start later this month.""We were of the impression that Microsoft would give its phone business a bit longer to see if it can grow,"" said Aimo Leskela, a trade union shop steward and 30-year veteran at Nokia. Mika Paukkeri, another shop steward, said he hoped Microsoft would cut its staff in Salo, not shut it down altogether. Sipila said Finland would apply for aid from the European Globalization Adjustment Fund, which supports people who have lost their jobs following major structural changes. Manufacturing of mobile phone handsets shifted from Salo to Asia in 2012.Shopping for fabrics in a local store this week, Maria Gustafsson said of the 20 years she has spent in Salo, ""it has never felt so bad living here. First Nokia closes the factory, now this.""Marjo-Riitta Maattanen and Heidi Kirjavainen have just opened a store in Salo's main shopping street for fabrics and clothing they usually sell online.""How ironic that we opened the shop just this week. Bad timing,"" Maattanen said. Finland's coalition government expects the economy to pick up this year but cut its 2015 growth forecast last month to just 0.3 percent. In contrast, neighboring Sweden is looking at 2.4 percent growth.The Finnish government is imposing tough austerity measures after rising public debt and budget deficits under the previous administration prompted a warning from the European Commission.In Salo, corporate income tax revenues have slumped from 60 million euros in 2010 to just 10 million last year, hitting municipal services such as schools and healthcare centers. Sipila's calls for the jobless to set up their own businesses are greeted with scepticism. ""Not everybody can be an entrepreneur,"" said Kirjavainen.Instead, locals hope bigger businesses will take advantage of IT know-how in Salo. Many are even still counting on Nokia, which said this week that it may start designing and licensing mobile phone handsets under its brand name in 2016.It has not mentioned Salo as a possible site but it has raised hopes.""Nokia's return to Salo would be ideal,"" shop steward Leskela said. ""We could just change back the signs on the door,"" Paukkeri added.

A trader appears to have bought 40,500 calls in an apparent bet on the ETF's shares rising above $45 by mid-September. The trade opens the biggest block of open interest in the ETF's options.Sentiment for the sector seems to have been boosted from Google Inc's (GOOGL.O) strong quarterly results on Thursday, which propelled its shares to an all-time high, strategists said. The effect was most noticeable for options on Apple, scheduled to report third-quarter revenue and profit results on Tuesday. Since Google's results, there has been a significant pick-up in demand for Apple calls, usually used to place bullish bets on the shares.""It just seems that as if Google ripped and traders came in pretty aggressively to set up on the long side in Apple,"" said Jim Strugger, a derivatives strategist at MKM Partners. By Monday afternoon, Apple's options volume was at 1.2 million contracts compared with an average daily volume of 820,000 contracts, according to Trade Alert.Calls betting on Apple shares rising above $140 and $135 by Friday, were the busiest, with combined options volume of more than 100,000 contracts. Microsoft and IBM also attracted brisk activity in the options market. Options on IBM, expected to post quarterly results after the close of trading on Monday, were especially busy with trading volume at 108,000 contracts, or five times normal levels, according to Trade Alert data.

804,"  * Apple, Microsoft corporate reports spur safety bid* 10-, 30-year yields hit nearly two-week lows* Uncertainty over next week's Fed statement caps gainsBy Sam ForgioneNEW YORK, July 22 Benchmark and long-dated Treasury yields hit their lowest levels in nearly two weeks on Wednesday after another round of disappointing U.S. corporate reports drove safe-haven buying, while uncertainty ahead of next week's Federal Reserve meeting capped gains. U.S. shares edged lower after results from technology giants including Apple and Microsoft. Yields on benchmark 10-year notes and 30-year bonds hit their lowest levels since July 9 of 2.31 percent and 3.04 percent, respectively.""The weakness in the stock market over the last two days has helped push Treasuries prices higher,"" said Shyam Rajan, U.S. rates strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York. He also said corporate issuance has been slightly lower than expected. Corporate supply typically weighs on Treasuries prices.Analysts said traders' caution ahead of next week's Fed meeting limited price gains, since traders will be watching the central bank's statement closely for signs of whether the Fed will hike rates in September or later. Rate hikes are expected to hurt bond prices, which move inversely to yields. ""We're looking at the Fed next week. That's keeping a lot of people ambiguous and not wanting to take that big a position one way or another,"" said Robbert van Batenburg, director of market strategy at Societe Generale in New York.""If the Fed is still hell-bent on hiking rates in September, it's probably going to shine through the statement,"" van Batenburg said. Fed Chair Janet Yellen repeated the view last week that the central bank would likely raise rates this year.Treasuries prices advanced despite data showing home resales rose in June to their highest level in nearly 8-1/2 years. Societe Generale's van Batenburg said weakness in oil prices helped boost Treasuries prices despite the housing data, since the weak oil prices signaled lower inflation.

807,"   By Dominique Vidalon | PARIS  PARIS French media and entertainment technology group Technicolor will buy Cisco System's home video equipment business for 550 million euros ($602 million), it said on Thursday, sending its shares to a five-year high.The cash-and-stock deal is part of Technicolor's efforts to expand in the thriving home video market and boost profitability. It will create the world No. 2 in customer premises equipment (CPE) - phone gear, cable and satellite TV set-top boxes, routers and switches - with total sales of 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) and a 15 percent market share.That compares with 25 percent that will be held by U.S. network gear maker Arris Group and British set-box maker Pace when they complete a merger.""Video is what is driving traffic today,"" Technicolor CEO Frederic Rose told a conference call. ""All this is fueling a massive demand for customer premises television equipment.""By 1014 GMT Technicolor shares were up 19 percent, trading near 7.5 euros, their highest level in five years.""This deal makes sense as Technicolor needed to increase its size especially after the ongoing Pace/Arris deal,"" said one Paris-based trader. He said Technicolor was buying Cisco's business for four times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Rose acknowledged that talks between Technicolor and Cisco accelerated after the Arris-Pace deal was announced in April.The transaction will also boost Technicolor's footprint in North America, the biggest CPE market in the world. The combined company will make 57 percent of its sales in North America.It will double annual revenue at its Connected Home division, give it 290 million set-top boxes installed in over 100 countries, and generate annual savings of over 100 million euros from 2018, the company said. Rose said he did not expect any large-scale restructuring as the two companies had complementary products.The transaction is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter of 2015 or in the first quarter of 2016.After completion, Technicolor said its Connected Home division should reach adjusted EBITDA in excess of 200 million euros by the end of 2016, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 8-9 percent by 2017.The deal will also boost earnings per share by a double-digit percentage at a group level as of 2016, Technicolor said.  Under the terms of the deal, Cisco will receive about 413 million euros in cash and about 137 million euros in newly issued Technicolor shares, subject to certain adjustments provided for in the agreement.The 413 million euro cash portion will be financed through cash on hand and fully underwritten new debt.

814,"  (Adds background, no comment from Microsoft and Google)By Andrew ChungNEW YORK, July 30 In a setback for Google Inc , a U.S. appeals court ruled on Thursday that the low licensing rate Microsoft Corp pays to use some of Google's Motorola Mobility patents had been properly set.The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco said a lower court judge properly determined the patents' value even though the royalty rate was only a fraction of what Motorola had asked for. Google sold the Motorola handset business to Lenovo  last year but kept its patents.The court also upheld $14.5 million awarded to Microsoft for Motorola's breach of contract to license its patents fairly. Both Microsoft and Google declined to comment on the decision.The case has been broadly followed by the technology industry because it could affect how Google and others negotiate royalty rates on their technology. Microsoft sued Motorola in 2010, alleging Motorola had breached its obligation to offer licenses to wireless and video patents used in Xbox game consoles and Windows products at a reasonable cost.After a 2012 trial, U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle said the appropriate royalty rate was $1.8 million, far less than Motorola's demand for as much as $4 billion a year. A jury later found Motorola in breach of contract. Google appealed the verdict and the royalty rate to the 9th Circuit. The dispute highlighted a debate over how much patent owners should be able to ask others to pay to use inventions that have become widely adopted in certain technologies.Apple, Intel and other companies filed court papers in support of Microsoft's position, while major patent licenser Qualcomm opposed Robart's calculation, saying it will devalue patents and cause ""incalculable damage"" to innovation.The case in the 9th Circuit is Microsoft Corp vs. Motorola Mobility Inc et al, 14-35393.

818,"   By Andrew Chung | NEW YORK  NEW YORK InterDigital Inc has violated U.S. antitrust law by failing to keep its promise to fairly license its technology considered essential to mobile phone communications, Microsoft Corp said in a lawsuit on Thursday. The complaint against InterDigital, filed in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, deepens a long-standing fight over patent licensing between the two companies. It comes as the U.S. International Trade Commission is set to rule this month on whether Microsoft smartphones should be banned from being imported into the United States for infringing two of InterDigital's patents.Wilmington is the home base of InterDigital, which makes money through the licensing of patents. The lawsuit concerns patents considered to be critical to technologies that may be widely adopted in an industry. Owners of these kinds of patents typically commit to offering them to competitors at a reasonable rate and on fair terms.  Microsoft alleged InterDigital's ""abusive licensing practices"" over its patents that are essential for companies to make cellular devices violate federal anti-monopoly laws. InterDigital ""falsely promised"" to license these patents on reasonable terms so they would be accepted as industry standards but then charged exorbitant rates, Microsoft said in the complaint.A spokesman for the Redmond, Washington-based software giant said this ""violates its commitments and hurts consumers and competition."" A representative for InterDigital had no comment.According to the complaint, InterDigital is also using the prospect of an import ban to coerce Microsoft into paying the price InterDigital wants for access to its technology. In April, an ITC judge said Microsoft infringed two of InterDigital's patents related to moderating a mobile phone's power to reduce signal interference, and recommended that Microsoft's devices be blocked from import.  The full commission is scheduled to make a final ruling on the matter later this month. Companies often sue at the ITC to win an import ban and in federal court to win damages. The ITC judge also said there was evidence Microsoft had engaged in ""reverse patent holdup,"" a situation where a company uses technology covered by a patent but refuses to pay for a license. The judge said Microsoft has refused to negotiate with InterDigital in a meaningful way. In the new lawsuit, Microsoft said that because of InterDigital's ""monopolistic conduct,"" the court should triple any damages it awards, and order InterDigital to stop enforcing its patents.

828,"   By Michael Flaherty and Sinead Cruise | NEW YORK/LONDON  NEW YORK/LONDON Aug 31 Activist hedge funds have launched more non-U.S. campaigns this year than any year since the financial crisis, as managers slowly expand overseas in the face of a more challenging market at home.Companies in Europe and Japan are attractive targets for U.S. shareholder activists seeking higher investment returns and less competition among funds that have shaken up the U.S. corporate sector.That could mean big changes for boardrooms in London, Tokyo and other major markets as cash-rich activists push for management shakeups, acquisitions and disposals to boost share prices.Since the start of the year, activists targeted 131 companies outside the United States, a 47 percent increase from 2014, according to Activist Insight, an industry media and data firm.Non-U.S. activism by the top U.S. activist funds is on pace for the most campaigns this year since 2008. Fourteen such campaigns were launched since January, data from FactSet Shark Repellent show - three less than a post-crisis record set in 2013.""With U.S. valuations in general 25 percent higher than those in Japan or Europe, it was only a matter of time until Europe came into focus,"" said Neil Dwane, chief investment officer at Frankfurt-based Allianz Global Investors.Dwane said the European corporate sector has yet to recover from the financial crisis.""The sector has a lot of 'self-help' earnings potential across most of its industries,"" Dwane said, adding that the only exception was the pharmaceuticals industry and the consumer staples sector.U.S. activist ValueAct reported a 5.44 percent holding in engine maker Rolls-Royce in July. The influential San Francisco-based activist, which has invested in Microsoft and American Express, is now Rolls Royce's largest shareholder, and according to media reports, is also investing in British engineering group, Smiths.Activist advisors interviewed by Reuters say lower valuations and the U.K. corporate governance code make it an enticing target for activists. UK industrial companies worth more than $500 million - as one example - have on average, a pre-tax return on equity of 0.19 percent, Thomson Reuters data show, compared with 0.23 percent for the U.S. sector.The UK corporate governance code is also more shareholder friendly than the U.S. version, both in terms of disclosure requirements and the ability to nominate board directors, the advisors say.U.S. EXPORT The amount that U.S. activists spend on foreign campaigns is still a tiny fraction of what they allocate domestically. But corporate targets in the U.K., Japan and Canada are increasingly in the cross-hairs. Elliot Associates took on U.K. financial services group Alliance Trust earlier this year, and Third Point just bought a nearly $1 billion stake in Japan's Suzuki Motor Corp..""If you look beyond Europe, Japan's corporate governance rules are likely to change, which is one of the mandates of the Abenomics agenda. We expect to see more activist activity there,"" said Ajay Khorana, Global Co-Head of Citi's Financial Strategy and Solutions Group.Activist assets reached $129.7 billion in the second quarter of 2015, a 177 percent increase from 2010, J.P. Morgan said in a research note last month, citing Hedge Fund Research.That increase tracked a surge of campaigns and index-beating investment returns for activists. But this year, U.S. returns have taken a hit, which may add to the incentive of going farther afield: since launching in April, the S&P Activist Interest Index has a negative 14.67 percent annual return.

831,"   By Joseph Ax | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday will consider whether U.S. law enforcement can make American technology companies hand over customers' emails held overseas, in a case closely watched by privacy advocates, news organizations and business groups.Microsoft Corp is challenging a U.S. search warrant seeking the emails of an individual stored on a server in Ireland as part of a drug investigation. Details of the probe, including the identity of the person, have not been made public.    The case is the first in which a U.S. corporation has fought a warrant seeking data held abroad.Last year, a federal judge said Microsoft must turn over the information. U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska said the issue was whether the company controlled access to the emails, rather than the location where they are housed.In recent years, tech companies have begun building servers in foreign countries to speed up service for overseas customers. In friend-of-the-court briefs to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York, companies such as Verizon Communications Inc and Cisco Systems Inc warned their business could be harmed if users fear their private data is subject to seizure by U.S. investigators regardless of where they live.Meanwhile, the U.S. government would be unable to object if foreign governments used warrants to force corporations to hand over emails held in the United States, Microsoft argued. ""The power to embark on unilateral law enforcement incursions into a foreign sovereign country – directly or indirectly – has profound foreign policy consequences,"" the company wrote. ""Worse still, it threatens the privacy of U.S. citizens.""In response, the Obama administration said the request in question is more akin to a subpoena for records than a warrant requiring a physical search, since U.S. employees of Microsoft can access the emails.""A corporation cannot resist compliance with a subpoena merely on the ground that the responsive records are stored abroad,"" the government wrote. The appeal has drawn supporting briefs from nearly 100 organizations and individuals. Groups that are typically legal adversaries – the American Civil Liberties Union and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, for instance - are backing Microsoft's position.News organizations from The Washington Post to Fox News have also filed papers in support of Microsoft, expressing concern that U.S. law enforcement could gain access to journalists' private notes anywhere in the world.

839,"   By Daniel Wiessner  Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Wednesday was hit with a proposed class action lawsuit in U.S. court claiming its policy of ranking employees to determine pay and promotions led to discrimination against women.The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Seattle, Washington by former technician Katherine Moussouris, who claims she was passed over for promotions given to less-qualified men and was told supervisors did not like her ""manner or style.""Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft gives employees numerical rankings based on performance evaluations, according to the lawsuit, and routinely gave female workers lower ratings based on subjective criteria.""Microsoft systematically undervalues the efforts and achievements of its female technical employees,"" said Adam Klein of well-known employment law firm Outten & Golden in New York, one of the firms representing Moussouris.The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella last year was criticized for suggesting at an industry conference that women in technology jobs should not ask for pay raises and should have faith that their companies will compensate them fairly. He later apologized, but also maintained that the company paid men and women equally. Wednesday's lawsuit appeared to be the first of its kind filed against Microsoft.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, men in the tech industry last year earned about 24 percent more than their female colleagues.  Moussouris, who is seeking to represent a class of any female U.S. technical workers employed by Microsoft since 2009, also claims she received a low bonus in retaliation for reporting sexual harassment. She resigned in 2014 after seven years with the company, the lawsuit says, because supervisors failed to address what she claimed was pervasive discrimination. It was not clear how large the proposed class could be or what damages would be sought, but the lawsuit said they would be in excess of $5 million. Microsoft currently has about 117,000 employees. A number of other major tech companies are also facing gender discrimination claims. Lawsuits were filed earlier this year against Facebook (FB.O) and Twitter (TWTR.N) at the same time that a high-profile trial was wrapping up in a case against top Silicon Valley venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.Ellen Pao, a former junior partner with the firm, failed to convince a California jury that her bosses discriminated against her by making sexist comments, excluding her from meetings and giving desirable assignments to men.

842,"   By Mari Saito and Yasmeen Abutaleb | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Apple Inc. faces significant challenges selling its larger and more powerful iPad Pro to businesses because companies are reluctant to switch software vendors and use an expensive device that lacks specialized business apps, analysts said.""They've tried to ... focus on the enterprise but over the last two years it has really not been successful,"" said Daniel Ives, a senior analyst at FBR Capital Markets. The enterprise market, which is how Apple refers to its business customers, represents 10 percent of its $183 billion annual revenue, he said. Apple has at least one client so far: General Electric has given some of its 305,000 employees the option to use Apple devices at work, with 20,000 iPads and 60,000 iPhones now available in their offices. It is not clear how much this is worth for Apple, nor how it generates about $18 billion a year from the enterprise market.Apple officials declined to comment on plans to market iPads to business customers, referring queries to a product announcement event that happened Sept. 9. At that event, Phil Schiller, Apple senior vice president of worldwide marketing, said the iPad Pro was faster than 80 percent of portable PCs, signaling that Apple may think the device could replace workplace laptops from companies like Dell and HP. Schiller called the iPad Pro ""ideal for professional productivity."" Selling tablets to corporate buyers is an attractive option for Apple amid slowing global iPad sales, which have fallen for two quarters. Research firm Forrester projects that sales to businesses will represent as much as 20 percent of the overall tablet market by 2018, compared to 14 percent this year, as the market grows from 218 million units to 250 million units.""The iPad Pro is important for Apple because they're beginning to saturate the personal device space and it's a logical step for the company if they wish to expand their market share,"" said Michael Yoshikami, head of Destination Wealth Management, which has $1.5 billion under management and owns Apple shares.The price of its products is one obstacle Apple faces as it tries to move deeper into the enterprise market.The iPad Pro starts at $799 but costs more than $1,000 if buyers also want a keyboard and an optional stylus. That's more than Apple's existing tablets as well as devices made by Microsoft Corp and other PC makers like Lenovo. It's about the same price as Apple's own MacBook Air, a laptop.The iPad Pro's biggest competitor is likely Microsoft's 12-inch Surface Pro 3, also geared towards the business market. While the Surface has the same starting price as the iPad Pro, Apple charges extra for a keyboard and stylus. In July, Microsoft said its Surface line of tablets brought in $888 million in the most recent quarter, up 117 percent from the same time last year, boosted in largest part by the Surface Pro 3 and the launch of Surface 3.""The most formidable opposition to adoption is price ... The iPad Pro has a lot of utility and technology that Apple brought to bear but unfortunately the price never goes away as a challenge,"" said Keith Bachman, a senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets. It's also not clear how Apple is going to expand their sales to businesses, as only a few companies like GE have made any significant investment to switch to Apple devices, said J.P. Gownder, a Forrester principal analyst.At GE, which gives employees the option of using Apple devices at work, just 10,000 of its 170,000 office workers using computers on a regular basis use a Mac.In the meantime, Apple has entered into partnerships with IBM and Cisco, aimed at creating more enterprise-friendly software to run on iOS, the Apple operating system, but little is known about these partnerships. The iPad Pro is ""going to be a real accelerator for our partnership and Apple as well,"" said Katharyn White, IBM's vice president of strategy and markets for the company and Apple's partnership. ""Clients that have seen it and are thinking about it are really excited about it.""  A Forrester survey last year of more than 4,000 office workers found that they still rely heavily on laptops at the workplace and estimated that global information workers are three times more likely to use them for longer than four hours per day than tablets.Finally, analysts say that the vast majority of companies use custom-built applications and databases that are still not compatible with Apple's iOS and are unlikely to switch to Mac devices.GE has an internal group dedicated to developing applications that can run on Apple's mobile devices, and IBM and Apple are developing a number of iOS applications for enterprise clients in industries ranging from banking to healthcare. But for most companies, Gownder said, ""You still can't run all your business-critical applications through Apple.""Gownder wrote in a report on Thursday that technology decision-makers currently favor Windows over iOS for ease of support by 42 percent to 16 percent.""Enterprises have spent billions on applications that are unique to their business and having 40 apps from IBM doesn't change that fact overnight,"" he said.      (Editing by Stephen R.

858,"   By Lawrence Hurley | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected a bid by Microsoft Corp co-founder Paul Allen to revive several patent claims against AOL Inc, Apple Inc, Google Inc and Yahoo Inc over software pop-up notifications.The Supreme Court left in place a September 2014 ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington. The court mostly upheld a decision by a district court judge who had ruled that the defendants had not infringed upon Interval's patents.The patents, held by Allen's Interval Licensing, relate to the pop-ups that computer and smartphone users regularly see. Interval Licensing is the patent-licensing arm of a Silicon Valley research entity that Allen financed, Interval Research Corp, which shut down in 2000.Interval Licensing sued the tech companies in 2010, accusing them of infringing upon four of its patents, although only two became the subject of the appeal. It said they infringed upon the patents through products and software that use pop-up notifications, court documents said. Allen and partner David Liddle founded Interval Research in 1992. It employed more than 110 scientists and engineers and was granted 300 patents during its existence, according to court documents.AOL is part of Verizon Communications. The case is Interval Licensing v. AOL Inc, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 14-1362.

865,"  * Third quarter operating profit beats forecasts* Results released a week ahead of schedule* Still sees 2015 operating profit of 5.6-5.9 bln euros   (Rewrites, adds shares, analyst comment, detail)By Harro Ten WoldeFRANKFURT, Oct 13 Europe's biggest software maker SAP reported a 19 percent rise in third-quarter operating profit on Tuesday, surprising markets by bringing forward its forecast-beating results by a week.Revenues from its existing corporate customers held up, while the German company said it was stepping up its efforts to offer more of its products via the internet.Third-quarter operating profit, excluding special items, rose to 1.62 billion euros ($1.84 billion), beating the most optimistic estimate among 14 analysts, whose estimates ranged from 1.45 billion to 1.59 billion euros. SAP said it was sticking to its outlook for the full year for operating profit of 5.6 billion euros to 5.9 billion euros at constant currencies, which represents a rise of up to 5 percent from the figure of 5.6 billion euros last year.""Our strong double-digit growth in cloud and software revenue was mainly driven by excellent results in mature markets,"" SAP's Chief Financial Officer Luka Mucic said in a statement, adding that he expected continued volatility and economic challenges in emerging markets.SAP shares were 3 percent higher by 0915 GMT after earlier hitting their highest level in two months. The company published the figures in the small hours of Tuesday, a week earlier than planned, to keep markets informed of its progress. ""We see SAP's preliminary Q3 results as showing the strength of SAP's underlying businesses and in-line with our thesis on the company that the company will be able to grow revenue as they move to the Cloud,"" said Mark L. Moerdler, an analyst at Bernstein brokerage, sticking to his ""outperform"" rating for stock.SAP, whose customers include the world's biggest multinationals, specialises in business applications ranging from accounting to human resources to supply-chain management.Like established rivals such as Oracle, IBM  and Microsoft, SAP is striving to boost Internet-based sales to head off fast-growing newer competitors such as Workday  and Amazon.com's web software unit. While such software is less profitable in the short term, compared to its classic software installed on its customers local servers, providers hope to win higher revenues over time from subscription payments via cloud computing.SAP said its cloud subscriptions and support revenue more than doubled to 600 million euros in the third quarter.Third-quarter total revenue of 4.98 billion euros was slightly ahead of the average expectation of 4.93 billion.At the same time SAP's established on-premise licence business recoverd in the third quarter from a weak second quarter, growing 4 percent at constant currencies. In the second quarter licence revenues were down 7 percent at constant currencies.Analyst Daud Khan at Berenberg said that the fourth-quarter remained critical for SAP to reach its full-year targets.""Investors' overall impression is that despite pressures in Brazil and Russia, the licence business is holding up,"" the analyst said in a client note.

The company said that in several countries it can conduct limited demonstrations of specific aspects of its technology in ""highly secure, controlled IBM environments that have no external communication links"".IBM said such demonstrations were not unique to the company, pointing to Microsoft Corp's program to provide governments with controlled access to Microsoft Windows source code.

(bit.ly/1ZIAKgq)In April, China's bank regulator temporarily suspended financial industry cyber security rules that would force technology vendors to Chinese banks to hand over secret source code and adopt Chinese encryption algorithms, after feedback from banks. Beijing has considered its reliance on foreign technology a national security weakness, especially after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's revelations that U.S. spy agencies planted code in American-made software to snoop on overseas targets.Cybersecurity has been a significant irritant in U.S.-China ties, with both sides trading accusations of abuses. IBM has been more willing to strike closer partnerships with China's government than many of its fellow U.S. tech companies, WSJ said on Friday, citing people familiar with the company's strategy.China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology could not immediately be reached for comment.IBM said on Wednesday it would offer its cloud-computing platform Bluemix in China through a collaboration with Chinese data-center services company 21Vianet Group Inc.IBM shares were down marginally in afternoon trading.

868,"  (Adds details from conference call)By Lehar MaanOct 20 Yahoo Inc said on Tuesday it had signed a search advertising deal with Google Inc, providing a potential boost to Marissa Mayer's efforts to turn around the company, which also reported revenue and profit that fell short of market estimates.The deal with Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc, builds on an existing search partnership Microsoft Corp  under which Yahoo gets a percentage of revenue from ads displayed on its sites.Yahoo, whose shares were down 1.6 percent in after-hours trading, said the companies have agreed to delay implementation of the deal in the United States to allow the antitrust division of the Department of Justice to review it.Yahoo has been struggling to boost revenue from ad sales in the face of stiff competition from Google and Facebook.The Google deal was one of the few bright spots included in the company's third-quarter results statement.Yahoo said it expected fourth-quarter revenue of $1.16 billion-$1.20 billion, well below the average analyst estimate of $1.33 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mayer, in her fourth year as chief executive, said the forecast was ""not indicative of the performance we want.""""We are also experiencing continued revenue headwinds in our core (advertising) business, especially in the legacy portions,"" Mayer said on a call with analysts.MAVENS PERFORM  Yahoo said the proposed spinoff of its 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - a key issue for shareholders - may now close in January.Yahoo earlier this year sought a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to confirm whether the transaction,  worth about $27 billion currently, would result in a tax obligation. The tax agency denied the request, but Yahoo said it would go ahead with the spinoff by year-end anyway.Many analysts attribute little value to Yahoo's core business without its Asian assets, which also include a 35 percent stake in Yahoo Japan Corp. Apart from the Google deal, the only other good news came results came from Yahoo's emerging businesses, which Mayer calls Mavens - mobile, video, native and social advertising.Revenue in that area rose 43 percent to $422 million in the quarter. Native advertising refers to ads that blend into the type and style of the content being viewed.Excluding items, the company earned 15 cents per share, missing the average analyst estimate of 17 cents.Revenue after deducting fees paid to partner websites fell to $1.0 billion from $1.09 billion, and the company forecast a drop to $920 million-$960 million in the current quarter.Traffic acquisition costs, the amount Yahoo spends to attract users to its websites, jumped to $223 million in the quarter from $54 million a year earlier.GAAP revenue rose 6.8 percent to $1.23 billion, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $1.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Through Tuesday's close of $32.83, Yahoo's shares had lost 35 percent this year.

874,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Oct 23 The Nasdaq 100 index, dominated by U.S. technology stocks, may set a record high next week, helped by good earnings from Apple Inc expected on Tuesday.Technology shares led the U.S. stock market's recovery this  week from its worst correction in four years in August, thanks to gains in Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft , after the three companies reported better-than-expected earnings results.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9 percent to 17,646.70, the S&P 500 index recovered another 1.1 percent to 2,075.15, and the Nasdaq Composite closed the week up 2.27 percent at 5,031.86.Shares across Asia, Europe and the Americas all climbed, boosted by Thursday's message from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi that he was ready to increase the ECB's bond buying program, and by an interest rate cut by China's central bank.Factors this coming week that may provide further support for U.S. stocks include a Federal Reserve policy meeting, which is not expected to raise interest rates yet, a report on U.S. third-quarter economic growth, and earnings from Apple.The Nasdaq 100 index, including Apple, is just 1.5 percent below its year high and 4.0 percent from its record high back in March 2000.Intel and Microsoft have seen their stocks recover more than 30 percent each since Aug. 25, while Amazon  and Facebook rose 28 percent and 23 percent,  respectively.But the 'underperformer' among these companies has been Apple, up only 14.8 percent from its Aug. 25 close, less than the Nasdaq 100's 15.1 percent gain in that time.In contrast to Microsoft, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon, Apple shares did not post record or multi-year highs this week, even though it rose 7.2 percent, the largest weekly gain in a year. On Tuesday, though, Apple is expected to report $51.1 billion in revenue, a 21.3 percent increase compared to the same quarter of last year. Earnings are seen at $1.879 per share.""The bar has been raised a bit on its earnings report from where it was a week ago. The price action is telling you there's more optimism built into it,"" said Michael James, managing director of equities trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.Options market action shows traders expect Apple shares to move roughly 5.0 percent by the end of next week. The average move for the stock the day after its report in the last eight quarters was 4.4 percent, up or down.""Will an above-estimates from Apple and raised guidance help? Sure it will. But we could still get there without that happening,"" said James of the possibility of the Nasdaq 100 hitting a record. ""The power of the moves in some of these large cap tech stocks has been breathtaking,"" he said.Chip makers were also among the top five percentage gainers in the Nasdaq 100 since the index closed at its 2015 low on Aug. 25, with SanDisk topping the list with a 70 percent jump on the back of a takeover bid from Western Digital.The overwhelming leadership from established technology companies is a positive for this market move higher, according to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.""The last time the Nasdaq 100 was the market leader a lot of it was speculative investments, but these (tech) companies actually return money to shareholders,"" she said.""Tech deserves the leadership; the stock market is rewarding growth."" BIOTECH THE FLIP SIDE TO TECH STOCK LEADERSHIP While technology stocks have led the market recovery, biotech stocks have been a drag on performance.The Nasdaq Biotech Index is down 3.5 percent from its Aug. 25 close, and more than 20 percent below its year high. The three index components with the largest declines in market capitalization in the last eight weeks are Mylan, Illumina and Biogen.""There has been a major rotation out of healthcare and into tech and it has continued after the recent earnings reports,"" said Wedbush's James, referring to strong results from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet.Biotech stocks were shaken in September when U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton first tweeted concerns about drug prices and the selling spread to other areas of the healthcare sector. Investors have been dumping shares of everything from hospitals to traditional pharmaceutical companies and insurers in recent weeks.Since peaking in July, the Nasdaq Biotech Index has fallen 23 percent, the broad S&P Health Care Index has lost 12 percent and the S&P 500 Health Care Facilities index  is down 31 percent.Fund managers now say they expect regulatory threats on drug prices, disappointing earnings, higher interest rates that could hurt heavily indebted hospitals, and the loss of the initial Obamacare boost to business to all weigh on health sector stocks this year.

China's rate cut did not move commodities investors to bid up oil prices, which were flat to lower. China's surprise move saw it cut its benchmark one-year lending rate by 25 basis points to 4.35 percent and lower big banks' reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points to 17.5 percent.The FTSEurofirst was up 2 percent and added to what will be a fourth-straight week of gains for MSCI's 45-country All World index.In the FX markets, the offshore yuan sagged to its lowest in a month, while the euro stayed below $1.11 to put the dollar on course for its biggest weekly rise against major currencies since late May. ""It is basically throwing more fuel into the global risk rally after Draghi's pretty bold moves yesterday,"" said Alvin Tan, an FX strategist at Societe Generale, about the China cut.Global bond investors backed off safe-haven debt in the U.S. and Germany. Additional Chinese stimulus could help global growth, boosting yields on benchmark U.S. treasuries and European debt. The 10-year U.S. Treasury bond fell 16/32 in price to boost its yield to 2.087 percent.Separately, the prospect of more ECB stimulus by the end of the year saw Italian and Spanish  two-year government bond yields both turn negative for the first time ever, meaning investors effectively pay to hold them rather than get paid.Greece's bond curve was close to normalizing, having been distorted for months following its political crisis that saw it teeter on the brink of leaving the euro.""Draghi has come out and kitchen-sinked the whole thing, everything is now on the table,"" said Gavin Friend, a strategist at National Australia Bank in London.Brent was flat at $48.09 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 1 percent to $44.93.

882,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The Nasdaq 100 index, dominated by U.S. technology stocks, may set a record high next week, helped by good earnings from Apple Inc expected on Tuesday. Technology shares led the U.S. stock market's recovery this  week from its worst correction in four years in August, thanks to gains in Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft, after the three companies reported better-than-expected earnings results. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.9 percent to 17,646.70, the S&P 500 index recovered another 1.1 percent to 2,075.15, and the Nasdaq Composite closed the week up 2.27 percent at 5,031.86.Shares across Asia, Europe and the Americas all climbed, boosted by Thursday's message from European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi that he was ready to increase the ECB's bond buying program, and by an interest rate cut by China's central bank. Factors this coming week that may provide further support for U.S. stocks include a Federal Reserve policy meeting, which is not expected to raise interest rates yet, a report on U.S. third-quarter economic growth, and earnings from Apple.The Nasdaq 100 index, including Apple, is just 1.5 percent below its year high and 4.0 percent from its record high back in March 2000.Intel and Microsoft have seen their stocks recover more than 30 percent each since Aug. 25, while Amazon and Facebook rose 28 percent and 23 percent,  respectively. But the 'underperformer' among these companies has been Apple, up only 14.8 percent from its Aug. 25 close, less than the Nasdaq 100's 15.1 percent gain in that time.In contrast to Microsoft, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon, Apple shares did not post record or multi-year highs this week, even though it rose 7.2 percent, the largest weekly gain in a year. On Tuesday, though, Apple is expected to report $51.1 billion in revenue, a 21.3 percent increase compared to the same quarter of last year. Earnings are seen at $1.879 per share.""The bar has been raised a bit on its earnings report from where it was a week ago. The price action is telling you there's more optimism built into it,"" said Michael James, managing director of equities trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.Options market action shows traders expect Apple shares to move roughly 5.0 percent by the end of next week. The average move for the stock the day after its report in the last eight quarters was 4.4 percent, up or down.""Will an above-estimates from Apple and raised guidance help? Sure it will. But we could still get there without that happening,"" said James of the possibility of the Nasdaq 100 hitting a record.""The power of the moves in some of these large cap tech stocks has been breathtaking,"" he said. Chip makers were also among the top five percentage gainers in the Nasdaq 100 since the index closed at its 2015 low on Aug. 25, with SanDisk topping the list with a 70 percent jump on the back of a takeover bid from Western Digital.The overwhelming leadership from established technology companies is a positive for this market move higher, according to Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.""The last time the Nasdaq 100 was the market leader a lot of it was speculative investments, but these (tech) companies actually return money to shareholders,"" she said.""Tech deserves the leadership; the stock market is rewarding growth."" BIOTECH THE FLIP SIDE TO TECH STOCK LEADERSHIP While technology stocks have led the market recovery, biotech stocks have been a drag on performance. The Nasdaq Biotech Index is down 3.5 percent from its Aug. 25 close, and more than 20 percent below its year high. The three index components with the largest declines in market capitalization in the last eight weeks are Mylan, Illumina and Biogen.""There has been a major rotation out of healthcare and into tech and it has continued after the recent earnings reports,"" said Wedbush's James, referring to strong results from Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet.Biotech stocks were shaken in September when U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton first tweeted concerns about drug prices and the selling spread to other areas of the healthcare sector. Investors have been dumping shares of everything from hospitals to traditional pharmaceutical companies and insurers in recent weeks.Since peaking in July, the Nasdaq Biotech Index has fallen 23 percent, the broad S&P Health Care Index has lost 12 percent and the S&P 500 Health Care Facilities index is down 31 percent. Fund managers now say they expect regulatory threats on drug prices, disappointing earnings, higher interest rates that could hurt heavily indebted hospitals, and the loss of the initial Obamacare boost to business to all weigh on health sector stocks this year.

884,"  (Updates estimates in paragraph 13 and adds day of Apple earnings announcement)By David RandallNEW YORK Oct 26 U.S. companies are far from optimistic that next year will see them get a break from the tough economic and market conditions they have faced in 2015. And that may well hurt capital investment and jobs growth.In the first three weeks of October, 165 American companies have cited the slowing global economy in their outlooks for earnings and revenue. That is up from 108 in the same period last year, and 97 in the year-earlier quarter, according to an analysis of earnings reports by Thomson Reuters.Among the phrases that have appeared in many of those statements are ""challenging macroeconomic environment,"" or ""global headwinds.""Earnings and revenue have been depressed this year largely because of the strong dollar, economic weakness in China and Brazil, and tumbling oil and commodities prices.The rise in the value of the American currency means that profits earned in foreign currencies are worth less when translated into dollars, possibly making American exports less competitive.The weakness in major emerging markets has hit sales by U.S. multinationals and the plunge in the prices of energy, metals and minerals have not only hit oil producers and miners but the manufacturing and service companies who sell to them.The problems are clearly not across the board, as shown by better-than-expected results reported last Thursday by technology heavyweights Amazon.com Inc, Google-owner Alphabet Inc, and Microsoft Corp. They are all benefiting from the expansion of cloud-based computing.But among the major companies to announce job cuts in recent weeks are industrial conglomerates United Technologies Corp  and General Electric Co, technology giant Hewlett-Packard Co., and the world's largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger.Even social media company Twitter Inc, and biotechnology group Biogen Inc have said they are cutting jobs. Large employers announced 205,759 U.S. job cuts in the third quarter, the largest amount since the third quarter of 2009, according to a report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Caterpillar Inc, meanwhile, told analysts that it expects its capital spending to be ""less than half of what it was in 2012,"" while appliance maker Whirlpool Corp  lowered its capital spending for 2015 to between $700 million and $750 million, down from a previous forecast of $750 million to $800 million.Those moves are coming at a time when overall corporate earnings in the third quarter are on pace to fall by 2.8 percent from this time last year. So far 59 percent of companies have reported revenues that have fallen below analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data.And expectations for 2016 are falling as well - in July analysts were predicting that corporate earnings per share in the first two quarters would grow 9.2 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively; those figures now are down to 4.7 percent for the first quarter and 6.2 percent for the second.The companies own forecasts, meanwhile, are falling short of expectations at the greatest pace since June 2014, according to a BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report. Companies ""have a reason to be worried. This isn't a major economic slowdown, but a meaningful one, and once you see a reduction in risk taking you will see a reduction in growth,"" said Paul Hoffmeister, a portfolio manager with the Quaker Funds.REBOUND POSSIBLE Few expect the economy to go into a free-fall, of course. Should the dollar and oil prices stabilize, the prospects for many companies could improve quickly and their earnings and revenue could beat expectations, setting the stage for a stock rally.Some consumer-driven companies also continue to do well, both in the U.S. and even in China, where both Nike Inc  and toy-maker Mattel have said they still see high rates of growth. Apple Inc, which reports its quarterly results Tuesday, has said that China remains a big part of its growth plans. And some multinationals who have taken a pounding, such as household products giant Procter & Gamble Co, have signaled they may be turning a corner. P&G said it sees sales growth strengthening in the second half of the year, as it focuses on more profitable lines such as Pampers diapers and Tide detergent.Many of those feeling the pinch from slowing growth overseas are the same companies that just a few years ago were counting on China and other emerging economies to bolster their bottom lines.For example, International Business Machines Corp, which cut its full-year profit forecast, said fewer big deals in China caused revenue from that country to fall 17 percent in the third quarter.Alan Gayle, a portfolio manager at RidgeWorth Investments, said that he has been increasingly moving more of his equity portfolio into U.S.-based companies that have limited exposure to China and other emerging markets.""I've pulled back from my China and emerging market exposure until there are clearer signs that the economy has stopped slowing,"" he said, adding that he expects that top-line revenue growth will continue to be a challenge for U.S. companies there.Yet he remains guardedly optimistic that oil and other commodity prices are nearing a bottom, and that consumer spending in the U.S. and Europe should remain steady.""We think the chances of a global recession remain quite low,""  he said.(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, Robin Paxton and Bill Berkrot; Editing by Linda Stern, Martin Howell and Bernadette Baum)",2015-10-26,MSFT,"Mon Oct 26, 2015 | 1:47pm EDT","UPDATE 1-With global outlook weak, many U.S. companies tighten belts",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-companies-outlook-idUSL1N12Q1IO20151026?type=companyNews,0.9929,0.045,0.862,0.093

887,"  * Activision makes big push into mobile gaming market* Combined company to have over 500 mln monthly active users* To pay $18 per share, in all cash-deal* Deal is 20 percent below the 2012 IPO price* Activision shares down 0.5 pct, King trades near offer price   (Adds share move, analyst comment)By Eric Auchard and Leila AbboudDUBLIN, Nov 3 Video game maker Activision Blizzard will buy ""Candy Crush Saga"" creator King Digital Entertainment for $5.9 billion, as the heavyweight of console and PC-gaming makes a major push into the faster-growing mobile market.The deal is one of the biggest in the industry in recent years, more than twice the size of Microsoft Inc's $2.5 billion purchase of ""Minecraft"" maker Mojang last year, and the biggest-ever acquisition of a mobile gaming company.The failure of Dublin-based King to replicate the success of Candy Crush with follow-up titles such as ""Farm Heroes"" and ""Pet Rescue"" has led some investors to think it may be a one-hit wonder.But Activision, whose shares were down 0.5 percent at $34.43 in early trading, is betting that its experience in sustaining long-running blockbuster franchises like ""Call of Duty"" and ""World of Warcraft"" can help it develop new hit series.Cowen & Co analysts described the deal as ""an absolute steal"", but others expressed skepticism. ""The combination increases Activision's scope and scale, but more importantly gives the company another top-quality IP (intellectual property) creator,"" the Cowan analysts wrote.The deal also gives the U.S. company a major presence in the mobile market, where games sales are expected to grow 21 percent this year to $20.6 billion, according to research firm Newzoo.That compares with expected growth of 7 percent for computer games and 2 percent for TV and console games, although they will still represent the lion's share of the $91.5 billion overall industry, according to the industry researchers.Activision is paying $18 per share in cash, showing how the company's fortunes have flagged since its 2012 initial public offering at $22.50 per share. The offer is a premium of 16 percent to King's close on Monday.King's net revenue - still heavily reliant on Candy Crush - fell 16 percent in the second quarter. King's shares were trading at $17.73 on Tuesday morning, indicating that investors don't expect a higher bid.Analysts at Jefferies & Co were among those expressing some doubts about the deal, saying that King faced a ""daunting task"" in replicating the success of Candy Crush.""We expect a heavy dose of scepticism from investors especially given the large deal size,"" said the brokerage, which nonetheless recommended that investors buy Activision shares.500 MILLION USERS  With the gaming business driven by blockbusters as much as the movie business, some companies such as Finland's Rovio, the maker of Angry Birds, and online games company Zygna  have faded after failing to follow up with new hits.Activision said buying King would help broaden the reach of its games, adding that 60 percent of King's players were female, and that the combined company would have more than 500 million monthly active users across the world.Activision, whose action games appeal mainly to males, focuses mainly on console and PC-based games whereas King's offerings are designed for mobile devices and playing online.Santa Monica, California-based Activision said the deal would add to its estimated 2016 adjusted revenue and earnings by about 30 percent. It will use $3.6 billion of cash held offshore to fund the acquisition, and borrow the rest.King will continue to operate as an independent unit led by Chief Executive Riccardo Zacconi, who told Reuters that Activision appealed to him because of the company's expertise in building long-lasting franchises.European private equity fund Apax listed King in 2014 and holds a 44.68 percent stake in the company, according to Thomson Reuters data.The deal, expected to be completed by spring 2016, is subject to approval by King's shareholders and the Irish High Court, and clearances by antitrust authorities.Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Activision on the deal, while King was advised by J.P. Morgan.(Additional reporting by Supriya Kurane in Bengaluru, Liana Baker in New York and Freya Berry in London; Editing by Pravin Char and Ted Kerr)",2015-11-03,MSFT,"Tue Nov 3, 2015 | 10:12am EST",UPDATE 5-Activision Blizzard buys 'Candy Crush' maker in mobile push,http://www.reuters.com//article/king-digital-ma-activision-idUSL3N12Y1HB20151103?type=companyNews,0.9874,0.034,0.877,0.089

904,"   By Joseph Menn | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Corp experts concluded several years ago that Chinese authorities had hacked into more than a thousand Hotmail email accounts, targeting international leaders of China’s Tibetan and Uighur minorities in particular – but it decided not to tell the victims, allowing the hackers to continue their campaign, according to former employees of the company.  On Wednesday, after a series of requests for comment from Reuters, Microsoft said it will change its policy and in the future tell its email customers when it suspects there has been a government hacking attempt. Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw said the company was never certain of the origin of the Hotmail attacks.The company also confirmed for the first time that it had not called, emailed or otherwise told the Hotmail users that their electronic correspondence had been collected. The company declined to say what role the exposure of the Hotmail campaign played in its decision to make the policy shift.     The first public signal of the attacks came in May 2011, though no direct link was immediately made with the Chinese authorities. That's when security firm Trend Micro Inc announced it had found an email sent to someone in Taiwan that contained a miniature computer program. The program took advantage of a  previously undetected flaw in Microsoft’s own web pages to direct Hotmail and other free Microsoft email services to secretly forward copies of all of a recipient’s incoming mail to an account controlled by the attacker.      Trend Micro found more than a thousand victims, and Microsoft patched the vulnerability before the security company announced its findings publicly. Microsoft also launched its own investigation that year, finding that some interception had begun in July 2009 and had compromised the emails of top Uighur and Tibetan leaders in multiple countries, as well as Japanese and African diplomats, human rights lawyers and others in sensitive positions inside China, two former Microsoft employees said. They spoke separately and on the condition that they not be identified.    Some of the attacks had come from a Chinese network known as AS4808, which has been associated with major spying campaigns, including a 2011 attack on EMC Corp's security division RSA that U.S. intelligence officals publicly attributed to China. To see the report click here hereMicrosoft officials did not dispute that most of the attacks came from China, but said some came from elsewhere. They did not give further detail.""We weighed several factors in responding to this incident, including the fact that neither Microsoft nor the U.S. government were able to identify the source of the attacks, which did not come from any single country,"" the company said.  ""We also considered the potential impact on any subsequent investigation and ongoing measures we were taking to prevent potential future attacks.""    In announcing the new policy, Microsoft said: ""As the threat landscape has evolved our approach has too, and we’ll now go beyond notification and guidance to specify if we reasonably believe the attacker is `state-sponsored.'""    Requests for comment from China’s Foreign Ministry and the Cyberspace Administration of China were not immediately answered. The Chinese government routinely issues strong denials of involvement in all hacking activities.  INTERNAL DEBATE    After a vigorous internal debate in 2011 that reached Microsoft’s top security official, Scott Charney, and its then-general counsel and now president, Brad Smith, the company decided not to alert the users clearly that anything was amiss, the former employees said. Instead, it simply forced users to pick new passwords without disclosing the reason.The employees said it was likely the hackers by then had footholds in some of the victims' machines and therefore saw those new passwords being entered.    One of the reasons Microsoft executives gave internally in 2011 for not issuing explicit warnings was their fear of angering the Chinese government, two people familiar with the discussions said. Microsoft’s statement did not address the specific positions advocated by Smith and Charney. A person familiar with the executives’ thinking said that fear of Chinese reprisals did play a role given the company's concerns about the potential impact on customers. Microsoft said the company had believed the password resets would be the fastest way to restore security to the accounts.    ""Our primary concern was ensuring that our customers quickly took practical steps to secure their accounts, including by forcing a password reset,"" the statement said.     It is unclear what happened to the email users and their correspondents as a result of Microsoft's failure to alert them to the suspected government hacking. But some of those affected said they were now deeply worried about the risks, especially for those inside China.     “The Internet service providers and the email providers have an ethical and a moral responsibility to let the users know that they are being hacked,” said Seyit Tumturk, vice president of the World Uyghur Congress, whose account was among those compromised. “We are talking in people’s lives here.” HUNDREDS OF LIVES Unrest in Xinjiang, the Chinese region bordering Kazakhstan that is home to many Uighurs, has cost hundreds of lives in recent years. Beijing blames Islamist militants, while human rights groups say harsh controls on the religion and culture of the Uighurs have led to the violence.Until Wednesday, Microsoft had rejected the idea of explicit warnings about state-sponsored hacking, such as those Google Inc began in 2012, the former employees said. In the 2011 case, the company also opted not to send a more generic warning about hacking. Yahoo Inc and Facebook Inc have been issuing such warnings for several years, former employees of those companies told Reuters, including when the principal suspect was a government.    Both companies, along with Twitter Inc, announced in recent months that they would follow Google’s lead and explicitly notify users about suspected state-sponsored hacking.    Google said on average it now issues tens of thousands of warnings about targeting every few months, and that recipients often move to improve their security with two-factor authentication and other steps.    Reuters interviewed five of the Hotmail hacking victims that were identified as part of Microsoft’s investigation: two Uighur leaders, a senior Tibetan figure and two people in the media dealing with matters of interest to Chinese officials.    Most recalled the password resets, but none took the procedure as an indication that anyone had read his or her email, let alone that it may have been accessed by the Chinese government. “I thought it was normal, everybody gets it,” said one of the men, a Uighur émigré now living in Europe who asked not to be named because he left family behind in China.Another victim identified by Microsoft’s internal team was Tseten Norbu of Nepal, a former president of the Tibetan Youth Congress, one of the more outspoken members of a community that has frequently clashed with Chinese officials. Another Microsoft-identified victim was Tumturk, the World Uyghur Congress vice president who lives in Turkey.      Microsoft investigators also saw that emails had been forwarded from the account of Peter Hickman, a former American diplomatic officer who arranged high-profile speeches by international figures at the National Press Club in Washington for many years.    Hickman said he used his Hotmail account on Press Club computers to correspond with people, including the staff for the Tibetan government in exile, whose leader Lobsang Sangay spoke at the club in 2011; Tumturk's World Uyghur Congress, whose then-president Rebiya Kadeer spoke in 2009; and the president of Taiwan, who spoke by video link-up in 2007.    Hickman said he didn’t recall the password reset. He said he never suspected anything was wrong with the account, which he continues to use.

""I thought it was normal, everybody gets it,"" said one of the men, a Uighur émigré now living in Europe who asked not to be named because he left family behind in China.Another victim identified by Microsoft's internal team was Tseten Norbu of Nepal, a former president of the Tibetan Youth Congress, one of the more outspoken members of a community that has frequently clashed with Chinese officials. Another Microsoft-identified victim was Tumturk, the World Uyghur Congress vice president who lives in Turkey.Microsoft investigators also saw that emails had been forwarded from the account of Peter Hickman, a former American diplomatic officer who arranged high-profile speeches by international figures at the National Press Club in Washington for many years.Hickman said he used his Hotmail account on Press Club computers to correspond with people, including the staff for the Tibetan government in exile, whose leader Lobsang Sangay spoke at the club in 2011; Tumturk's World Uyghur Congress, whose then-president Rebiya Kadeer spoke in 2009; and the president of Taiwan, who spoke by video link-up in 2007.Hickman said he didn't recall the password reset. He said he never suspected anything was wrong with the account, which he continues to use.

907,"  (Adds Chinese Foreign Ministry comment)By Joseph MennSAN FRANCISCO Dec 31 Microsoft Corp  experts concluded several years ago that Chinese authorities had hacked into more than a thousand Hotmail email accounts, targeting international leaders of China's Tibetan and Uighur minorities in particular - but it decided not to tell the victims, allowing the hackers to continue their campaign, according to former employees of the company.On Wednesday, after a series of requests for comment from Reuters, Microsoft said it would change its policy and in future tell its email customers when it suspects there has been a government hacking attempt.The company also confirmed for the first time that it had not called, emailed or otherwise told the Hotmail users that their electronic correspondence had been collected. The company declined to say what role the exposure of the Hotmail campaign played in its decision to make the policy shift.The first public signal of the attacks came in May 2011, though no direct link was immediately made with the Chinese authorities. That's when security firm Trend Micro Inc  announced it had found an email sent to someone in Taiwan that contained a miniature computer program.The program took advantage of a  previously undetected flaw in Microsoft's own web pages to direct Hotmail and other free Microsoft email services to secretly forward copies of all of a recipient's incoming mail to an account controlled by the attacker.Trend Micro found more than a thousand victims, and Microsoft patched the vulnerability before the security company announced its findings publicly.Microsoft also launched its own investigation that year, finding that some interception had begun in July 2009 and had compromised the emails of top Uighur and Tibetan leaders in multiple countries, as well as Japanese and African diplomats, human rights lawyers and others in sensitive positions inside China, two former Microsoft employees said. They spoke separately and on the condition that they not be identified.Some of the attacks had come from a Chinese network known as AS4808, which has been associated with major spying campaigns, including a 2011 attack on EMC Corp's security division RSA that U.S. intelligence officials publicly attributed to China. To see the report click here hereMicrosoft officials did not dispute that most of the attacks came from China, but said some came from elsewhere. They did not give further detail.""We weighed several factors in responding to this incident, including the fact that neither Microsoft nor the U.S. government were able to identify the source of the attacks, which did not come from any single country,"" the company said.  ""We also considered the potential impact on any subsequent investigation and ongoing measures we were taking to prevent potential future attacks.""In announcing the new policy, Microsoft said: ""As the threat landscape has evolved our approach has too, and we'll now go beyond notification and guidance to specify if we reasonably believe the attacker is `state-sponsored.'""The Chinese government ""is a resolute defender of cyber security and strongly opposes any forms of cyberattacks"", Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said, adding that it punishes any offenders in accordance with the law. ""I must say that if the relevant party has some real and conclusive evidence, then it can carry out mutually beneficial cooperation with China in a constructive way in accordance with the existing channels,"" Lu said at a daily news briefing.""But if there's the frequent spreading of unfounded rumours, it will, in fact, be of no benefit to solving the problem, enhancing mutual trust and promoting cybersecurity.""The Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to a request for comment.INTERNAL DEBATE After a vigorous internal debate in 2011 that reached Microsoft's top security official, Scott Charney, and its then-general counsel and now president, Brad Smith, the company decided not to alert the users clearly that anything was amiss, the former employees said. Instead, it simply forced users to pick new passwords without disclosing the reason.The employees said it was likely the hackers by then had footholds in some of the victims' machines and therefore saw those new passwords being entered. One of the reasons Microsoft executives gave internally in 2011 for not issuing explicit warnings was their fear of angering the Chinese government, two people familiar with the discussions said.Microsoft's statement did not address the specific positions advocated by Smith and Charney. A person familiar with the executives' thinking said that fear of Chinese reprisals did play a role given the company's concerns about the potential impact on customers.Microsoft said the company had believed the password resets would be the fastest way to restore security to the accounts.""Our primary concern was ensuring that our customers quickly took practical steps to secure their accounts, including by forcing a password reset,"" the statement said.It is unclear what happened to the email users and their correspondents as a result of Microsoft's failure to alert them to the suspected government hacking.

That's when security firm Trend Micro Inc  announced it had found an email sent to someone in Taiwan that contained a miniature computer program.The program took advantage of a  previously undetected flaw in Microsoft's own web pages to direct Hotmail and other free Microsoft email services to secretly forward copies of all of a recipient's incoming mail to an account controlled by the attacker.Trend Micro found more than a thousand victims, and Microsoft patched the vulnerability before the security company announced its findings publicly.Microsoft also launched its own investigation that year, finding that some interception had begun in July 2009 and had compromised the emails of top Uighur and Tibetan leaders in multiple countries, as well as Japanese and African diplomats, human rights lawyers and others in sensitive positions inside China, two former Microsoft employees said. They spoke separately and on the condition that they not be identified.Some of the attacks had come from a Chinese network known as AS4808, which has been associated with major spying campaigns, including a 2011 attack on EMC Corp's security division RSA that U.S. intelligence officials publicly attributed to China. To see the report click here hereMicrosoft officials did not dispute that most of the attacks came from China, but said some came from elsewhere. They did not give further detail.""We weighed several factors in responding to this incident, including the fact that neither Microsoft nor the U.S. government were able to identify the source of the attacks, which did not come from any single country,"" the company said.  ""We also considered the potential impact on any subsequent investigation and ongoing measures we were taking to prevent potential future attacks.""In announcing the new policy, Microsoft said: ""As the threat landscape has evolved our approach has too, and we'll now go beyond notification and guidance to specify if we reasonably believe the attacker is `state-sponsored.'""The Chinese government ""is a resolute defender of cyber security and strongly opposes any forms of cyberattacks"", Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said, adding that it punishes any offenders in accordance with the law. ""I must say that if the relevant party has some real and conclusive evidence, then it can carry out mutually beneficial cooperation with China in a constructive way in accordance with the existing channels,"" Lu said at a daily news briefing.""But if there's the frequent spreading of unfounded rumours, it will, in fact, be of no benefit to solving the problem, enhancing mutual trust and promoting cybersecurity.""The Cyberspace Administration of China did not respond to a request for comment.INTERNAL DEBATE After a vigorous internal debate in 2011 that reached Microsoft's top security official, Scott Charney, and its then-general counsel and now president, Brad Smith, the company decided not to alert the users clearly that anything was amiss, the former employees said. Instead, it simply forced users to pick new passwords without disclosing the reason.The employees said it was likely the hackers by then had footholds in some of the victims' machines and therefore saw those new passwords being entered. One of the reasons Microsoft executives gave internally in 2011 for not issuing explicit warnings was their fear of angering the Chinese government, two people familiar with the discussions said.Microsoft's statement did not address the specific positions advocated by Smith and Charney. A person familiar with the executives' thinking said that fear of Chinese reprisals did play a role given the company's concerns about the potential impact on customers.Microsoft said the company had believed the password resets would be the fastest way to restore security to the accounts.""Our primary concern was ensuring that our customers quickly took practical steps to secure their accounts, including by forcing a password reset,"" the statement said.It is unclear what happened to the email users and their correspondents as a result of Microsoft's failure to alert them to the suspected government hacking. But some of those affected said they were now deeply worried about the risks, especially for those inside China.""The Internet service providers and the email providers have an ethical and a moral responsibility to let the users know that they are being hacked,"" said Seyit Tumturk, vice president of the World Uyghur Congress, whose account was among those compromised. ""We are talking in people's lives here."" HUNDREDS OF LIVES Unrest in Xinjiang, the Chinese region bordering Kazakhstan that is home to many Uighurs, has cost hundreds of lives in recent years. Beijing blames Islamist militants, while human rights groups say harsh controls on the religion and culture of the Uighurs have led to the violence.Until Wednesday, Microsoft had rejected the idea of explicit warnings about state-sponsored hacking, such as those Google Inc  began in 2012, the former employees said. In the 2011 case, the company also opted not to send a more generic warning about hacking. Yahoo Inc and Facebook Inc have been issuing such warnings for several years, former employees of those companies told Reuters, including when the principal suspect was a government.Both companies, along with Twitter Inc, announced in recent months that they would follow Google's lead and explicitly notify users about suspected state-sponsored hacking.Google said on average it now issues tens of thousands of warnings about targeting every few months, and that recipients often move to improve their security with two-factor authentication and other steps.Reuters interviewed five of the Hotmail hacking victims that were identified as part of Microsoft's investigation: two Uighur leaders, a senior Tibetan figure and two people in the media dealing with matters of interest to Chinese officials.Most recalled the password resets, but none took the procedure as an indication that anyone had read his or her email, let alone that it may have been accessed by the Chinese government.""I thought it was normal, everybody gets it,"" said one of the men, a Uighur émigré now living in Europe who asked not to be named because he left family behind in China.Another victim identified by Microsoft's internal team was Tseten Norbu of Nepal, a former president of the Tibetan Youth Congress, one of the more outspoken members of a community that has frequently clashed with Chinese officials. Another Microsoft-identified victim was Tumturk, the World Uyghur Congress vice president who lives in Turkey.Microsoft investigators also saw that emails had been forwarded from the account of Peter Hickman, a former American diplomatic officer who arranged high-profile speeches by international figures at the National Press Club in Washington for many years.Hickman said he used his Hotmail account on Press Club computers to correspond with people, including the staff for the Tibetan government in exile, whose leader Lobsang Sangay spoke at the club in 2011; Tumturk's World Uyghur Congress, whose then-president Rebiya Kadeer spoke in 2009; and the president of Taiwan, who spoke by video link-up in 2007.Hickman said he didn't recall the password reset. He said he never suspected anything was wrong with the account, which he continues to use.

921,"   By John Miller | ZURICH  ZURICH Novartis wants every puff of its emphysema drug Onbrez to go into the cloud. The Swiss drugmaker has teamed up with U.S. technology firm Qualcomm to develop an internet-connected inhaler that can send information about how often it is used to remote computer servers known as the cloud. This kind of new medical technology is designed to allow patients to keep track of their drug usage on their smartphones or tablets and for their doctors to instantly access the data over the web to monitor their condition.It also creates a host of ""Big Data"" opportunities for the companies involved - with huge amounts of information about a medical condition and the efficacy of a drug or device being wirelessly transmitted to a database from potentially thousands, even millions, of patients.The potential scale of the so-called ""Medical Internet of Things"" has not been lost on pharmaceutical and tech firms around the world, both big companies hunting growth and smaller ones looking to provide bespoke products and services. It has created unlikely alliances. Novartis' domestic rival Roche has also teamed up with Qualcomm and Danish diabetes drugmaker Novo Nordisk has partnered with IBM on cloud-linked device projects, for example, while healthcare device maker Medtronic is working with a U.S. data-analytics firm Glooko.GlaxoSmithKline, meanwhile, is in talks with Qualcomm about a medical technology joint venture potentially worth up to $1 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.    However, with the opportunity comes risk.Security experts warn that hacked medical information can be worth more than credit card details on the black market as fraudsters can use it to fake IDs to buy medical equipment or drugs that can be resold, or file bogus insurance claims.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are 35 million U.S. hospital discharges a year, a billion doctor and hospital visits and even more prescriptions, much of which is stored in cloud databases. CLOUD CONCERN Now the ""Medical Internet of Things"" is introducing more and more web-connected devices into the equation and pushing even more confidential patient data on to the cloud. This is creating potential new opportunities for thieves seeking to penetrate medical companies' security where they may target names, birth dates, policy numbers, billing data and the diagnosis codes needed to obtain drugs, say experts. ""The weakest link tends to be the medical device itself,"" said Rick Valencia, senior vice president of Qualcomm Life, Qualcomm's four-year-old healthcare unit. ""They weren't designed with the idea in mind that they would be going over the network and the information would be residing in cloud infrastructure.""Medtronic, the world's largest standalone medical device maker, said in 2014 it lost patient records in separate cyberattacks at its diabetes business. ""The more information, the easier identity theft is and the more valuable the profiles that the hacker can sell to third parties,"" said Erik Vollebregt, a lawyer in Amsterdam who specializes in medical device cybersecurity and privacy.He said it could also be possible for criminals to hack into web-connected medical devices, and threaten the lives of patients, to blackmail the manufacturer. Despite no documented patient-endangering hacks, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned last year an infusion pump could be vulnerable to attack and asked healthcare providers to stop using it.  SMART LENS Novartis aims to have its inhaler for chronic lung disease, to be on the market by 2019. Other pharma-tech alliances include Aerocrine and Microsoft, which are working together on a cloud project to analyze data from allergy and asthma patients.Google is, meanwhile, working with French drugmaker Sanofi to collect and analyze information from diabetes sufferers. The U.S. tech giant also has a partnership with Novartis to develop a smart contact lens that can monitor diabetics' glucose levels. All the companies involved in such projects say they are going to extreme lengths to protect patients' data from hackers. Philips has turned to San Francisco-based identity-management software maker ForgeRock to keep data from the Dutch company's medical devices from falling into the wrong hands. Software security expert Marie Moe, of Norway's SINTEF scientific research foundation, said the wireless ports in the pacemaker that keeps her heart beating left it vulnerable to intrusion - but that she could not survive without the device.""Wireless interfaces are a great benefit to certain patient groups,"" she told Reuters. ""But as a security researcher, I know connectivity also means vulnerability.""

923,"  (In first paragraph, corrects to fiscal second-quarter earnings from fourth quarter earnings)By Sarah McBrideSAN FRANCISCO Jan 29 In reporting better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday, Microsoft Corp CEO Satya Nadella touted his company's success in the cloud.""Businesses everywhere are using the Microsoft Cloud as their digital platform to drive their ambitious transformation agendas,"" he said.What he didn't mention was the role that one of the company's much older products played in the success of this new technology:  Microsoft Exchange Server, which many of the world's largest companies rely on for email services.When companies begin moving data to the cloud, typically a network of servers managed by an outside company, a common first step is to move email, often with other office software tools but sometimes on its own.For companies already relying on Microsoft Exchange and Outlook for sending and receiving email, information technology managers say, turning to the same company to handle that data in the cloud seems like a logical move. That's what happened at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.The school was looking to streamline its technology by moving to the cloud, starting with email, because it is ""a pain to operate,"" said Bob Plankers, a virtualization architect at the university. ""Aside from email servers, you need to worry about spam and virus scanning,"" he added.For the transition, Plankers said he chose Microsoft's cloud-based Office 365 product because the university already used Outlook.""It's just a really natural thing,"" said Matt McIllwain, an investor at Madrona Venture Group, about companies starting their cloud transition with email and other widely used office software from Microsoft. ""It's easier and can be more cost effective to run it on the cloud, and let Microsoft worry about your Exchange servers."" Such thinking helps explain how Microsoft has become the second largest provider of cloud infrastructure, services and software, well ahead of Salesforce, Oracle and Google, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.The company announced Thursday that it was on track to generate $9.4 billion in annual cloud-based revenue, up from $5.5 billion a year ago.Microsoft remains far behind market leader Amazon, but it has become the fastest-growing major cloud provider. Its key Azure business has more than doubled year on year, well above the 65 percent growth rate of market leader Amazon, according to Goldman. Microsoft has worked hard to exploit the advantage its mail software provides. ""Maybe one of the first steps is you want to move your email. That's fine,"" says Takeshi Numoto, corporate vice president for cloud and enterprise marketing. ""That gets us more opportunity to engage with customers.""Investor McIllwain called that strategy smart, because customers who move their Outlook email to Microsoft's cloud typically use a Microsoft directory service that controls access to that email. It then becomes simple to use that same directory to provide designated employees access to other data and services that are later moved to Microsoft's cloud.The strategy isn't foolproof, however. Over seven months last year, Clif Bar, an Oakland, Calif.-based snack provider, moved all its Outlook email, along with other applications like document management and workflow, to Azure.The company nevertheless moved its enterprise resource management to the cloud services of another longtime partner: Oracle.As cloud services rapidly expand, Microsoft will have to demonstrate that its products are equal to, or better than, those of its competitors in both quality and price.Currently, many companies favor Microsoft because it offers more flexibility in terms of moving software around, say from a company's own data center to the one it has outsourced to Azure, said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research. But Amazon's AWS offers more types of tools, and has a longer track record selling cloud services, he said.

Japan's central bank cut a benchmark rate below zero to stimulate its economy, a surprise move that boosted global equities.Wall Street's rally follows four weeks of volatility that has left the S&P 500 down 6 percent, in large part due to collapsing oil prices that have crippled energy companies and fed doubts about the health of the global economy.""Sentiment certainly had swung to a wildly negative scenario.

925,"  (In first paragraph, corrects to fiscal second-quarter earnings from fourth quarter earnings)By Sarah McBrideSAN FRANCISCO Jan 29 In reporting better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings on Thursday, Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella touted his company's success in the cloud.""Businesses everywhere are using the Microsoft Cloud as their digital platform to drive their ambitious transformation agendas,"" he said.What he didn't mention was the role that one of the company's much older products played in the success of this new technology:  Microsoft Exchange Server, which many of the world's largest companies rely on for email services.When companies begin moving data to the cloud, typically a network of servers managed by an outside company, a common first step is to move email, often with other office software tools but sometimes on its own.For companies already relying on Microsoft Exchange and Outlook for sending and receiving email, information technology managers say, turning to the same company to handle that data in the cloud seems like a logical move. That's what happened at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.The school was looking to streamline its technology by moving to the cloud, starting with email, because it is ""a pain to operate,"" said Bob Plankers, a virtualization architect at the university. ""Aside from email servers, you need to worry about spam and virus scanning,"" he added.For the transition, Plankers said he chose Microsoft's cloud-based Office 365 product because the university already used Outlook.""It's just a really natural thing,"" said Matt McIllwain, an investor at Madrona Venture Group, about companies starting their cloud transition with email and other widely used office software from Microsoft. ""It's easier and can be more cost effective to run it on the cloud, and let Microsoft worry about your Exchange servers."" Such thinking helps explain how Microsoft has become the second largest provider of cloud infrastructure, services and software, well ahead of Salesforce, Oracle and Google, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis.The company announced Thursday that it was on track to generate $9.4 billion in annual cloud-based revenue, up from $5.5 billion a year ago.Microsoft remains far behind market leader Amazon, but it has become the fastest-growing major cloud provider. Its key Azure business has more than doubled year on year, well above the 65 percent growth rate of market leader Amazon, according to Goldman. Microsoft has worked hard to exploit the advantage its mail software provides. ""Maybe one of the first steps is you want to move your email. That's fine,"" says Takeshi Numoto, corporate vice president for cloud and enterprise marketing. ""That gets us more opportunity to engage with customers.""Investor McIllwain called that strategy smart, because customers who move their Outlook email to Microsoft's cloud typically use a Microsoft directory service that controls access to that email. It then becomes simple to use that same directory to provide designated employees access to other data and services that are later moved to Microsoft's cloud.The strategy isn't foolproof, however. Over seven months last year, Clif Bar, an Oakland, Calif.-based snack provider, moved all its Outlook email, along with other applications like document management and workflow, to Azure.The company nevertheless moved its enterprise resource management to the cloud services of another longtime partner: Oracle.As cloud services rapidly expand, Microsoft will have to demonstrate that its products are equal to, or better than, those of its competitors in both quality and price.Currently, many companies favor Microsoft because it offers more flexibility in terms of moving software around, say from a company's own data center to the one it has outsourced to Azure, said Frank Gillett, an analyst at Forrester Research. But Amazon's AWS offers more types of tools, and has a longer track record selling cloud services, he said.

While the Fed has not ruled out a rate hike in March, the current turmoil and weak data could force it to wait until June.""You've got again a sense that we're back to an easier central bank environment,"" said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG.""On top of that, we had a little bit of a bounce in oil and that gives people hope that maybe the global growth is at least not getting worse,"" he said.Oil prices hovered around $34 per barrel on Friday on hopes that top producers may agree to cut production, but gains were capped after reports said Iran would not lower output. Investors are still reeling from one of the worst starts to a year as oil prices remain under pressure and fears of a China-led global slowdown grow.U.S. stocks have failed to sustain rallies in 2016 and are yet to post gains for three days in a row. The S&P 500 has shed 7.4 percent this year through Thursday's close.At 12:29 p.m. ET (1729 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 270.48 points, or 1.68 percent, at 16,340.12, the S&P 500 was up 30.95 points, or 1.63 percent, at 1,924.31 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 68.68 points, or 1.52 percent, at 4,575.35.Microsoft was up 5.6 percent at $54.97 on the software giant's better-than-expected results.

927,"  Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported quarterly revenue and profit that beat analysts' expectations, driven by aggressive cost cutting and growing demand for its cloud products and services.Chief Executive Satya Nadella has focussed on cloud services and mobile applications on slower growth in its traditional software business. Companies moving much of their information technology off premises, part of the cloud-computing trend, proved a bright spot.""The enterprise cloud opportunity is massive, larger than any market we have ever participated in,"" Nadella said in a conference call. Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft's stock had climbed more than 26 percent in the past 12 months to $52.06 at Thursday's close, even as the broader market has dropped 5 percent. The shares rose 3 percent in after-hours trading.Revenue from the ""intelligent cloud"" business, which includes products such as its Azure cloud infrastructure and services business along with other noncloud products such as traditional servers, rose 5 percent to $6.3 billion. Perhaps a better indicator of its cloud strength is what the company calls its combined cloud business, on track for $9.4 billion in annual revenue, the company said. That measure, which includes Azure plus other businesses like Office 365, is up 15 percent from the $8.2 billion revenue it estimated last quarter. ""They nailed the cloud,"" said Matt Howard, a venture capitalist at Norwest Ventures who monitors Microsoft closely. Total revenue, however, fell 10.1 percent to $23.80 billion, squeezed by a strong dollar as well as a weak personal computer market that has reduced demand for Microsoft's Windows operating system. On an adjusted basis, revenue fell to $25.69 billion but beat analysts' estimates.Microsoft generates more than half of its revenue from outside the United States. Revenue in the business that includes Windows fell 5 percent to $12.66 billion. Windows revenue closely tracks sales of personal computers, which fell 10.6 percent globally in the December quarter from a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. IDC said business should improve later this year as companies that had delayed replacing machines before upgrading to Windows 10 make the switch. Microsoft released Windows 10 in July. Microsoft's net income fell to $5 billion, or 62 cents per share, in its second-quarter ended Dec. 31 from $5.86 billion, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier.

928,"   By Eric M. Johnson | SEATTLE  SEATTLE A massive luxury yacht owned by Microsoft Corp co-founder Paul Allen destroyed most of a protected coral reef during a visit to the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean earlier this month, media reported.An anchor chain from the vessel damaged nearly 14,000 square feet (1,300 square meters), or about 80 percent, of reef near two scuba diving sites in the West Bay, the islands' environment department said, according to the Cayman News Service.Allen's Seattle-based Vulcan Inc organization, which manages his fortune, said on Wednesday that the M/V Tatoosh was moored on Jan. 14 in a ""position explicitly directed"" by the local port authority and that his team was cooperating with the investigation.""When its crew was alerted by a diver that her anchor chain may have impacted coral in the area, the crew promptly, and on their own accord, relocated their position to ensure the reef was protected,"" Vulcan said.The damage to the coral, which is vital for marine life, comes five months after the billionaire philanthropist announced support for research to stabilize and restore coral reefs. Allen, who owns the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers, is also a massive benefactor in Seattle and beyond, funding everything from libraries to healthcare initiatives and oceanic exploration projects.At 92.42 meters (303.21 feet), Allen's five-deck Tatoosh is the 49th largest yacht in the world, and has twin helicopter landing pads, an observation lounge, and a gymnasium, according to BoatInternational.com. Allen was not on board at the time of the incident, Vulcan said.CNN reported that Allen could face a maximum fine of roughly $600,000, not counting civil damages. The Cayman News Service reported that divers surveyed the damage last week and that the environment department expects to issue its investigative findings next week. The service reported that shifting winds may have pushed Allen's vessel toward the coral reserve near the island, south of Cuba and home to some 58,400 residents. It also reported that the Cayman government has been unable to collect fines after a number of similar incidents over the last few years.The Cayman Department of Environment did not immediately respond to a request for comment, though an employee said the agency's director and staff were meeting about the incident on Thursday.

But Cisco relies heavily on demand from China and other developing countries whose economies have been losing steam.Stocks of companies selling cloud computing and data analytics fell for a second session on Monday after Tableau Software Inc last week disappointed investors with a weak revenue forecast.Analysts for year have been hyping companies in cloud computing and ""Big Data,"" which refers to the analysis of growing amounts of stored data, and investors are becoming more critical of the valuations on such stocks.Cisco's stock was unchanged on Monday while shares of other enterprise technology companies reporting this week fell sharply.  Along with Tableau's disappointing report, Monday's poor revenue forecast from IT services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp stood in contrast to relatively upbeat reports from Microsoft Corp and SAP SE , leaving investors uncertain about the broad health of IT spending.Cisco is expected to report a 1.5 percent drop in revenue for the January-ended quarter, according to Thomson Reuters, but investors fear the current quarter could be worse.

The Vive was developed by HTC and US video game developer Valve Corporation's software distribution platform Steam.    Similar in appearance to the Vive Pre, shown off at 2015's Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Nevada, the Vive contains a number of updated features.    The package includes two hand-tracking controllers and two Lighthouse laser tracking boxes, which measure the headset's position as users walk around.    Antonio Munoz, global account director at HTC, told Reuters: ""Today at MWC we are presenting as well some of the new features and functionality that comes with the new HMD (head-mounted display), which include a front-facing camera that will allow you to introduce some new safety features, like blending the real and the virtual world and we are also introducing some functionality that combines with the mobile phone use so that you're able to see the notifications and calls that you are getting on your mobile phone.""     As well as a gaming and video platform, the Vive is also designed to allow users to answer phone calls, read text messages, and view the user's phone calendar.    According to Munoz, ""our HMD, our headset, is connected to the PC and we run the games through the PC platforms. We, of course, are partnering with Steam who provide a huge customer base for gaming. They are the leaders in that space.""     The HTC Vive is available via pre-order, at a cost of $799 USD per unit. Munoz defended the apparently high price tag, saying it was ""worth every dollar"".      ""There's a lot of technology going on in that kit,"" said Munoz. ""As part of the default sales kit we provide two base stations that will fully track the user within the room. We provide two fully tracked controllers and then also the HMD that includes a camera, a microphone, super high quality lenses, and also a very high resolution display. So there's actually a lot of technology coming in that kit and we feel actually what we are providing the user is definitely worth every dollar.""       The HTC will be going head-to-head - or headset-to-headset - with the likes of Oculus Rift, Samsung, Sony, and Microsoft in a bid to become market leader in the growing VR sector. Market analysts CCS Insight believe that 13 million VR headsets will have been sold by the end of this year, a figure projected to rise to 97 million by 2020.     Rob Kerr, technology and mobiles expert for UK-based price comparison service uSwitch, says suggestions that VR is a fuss about nothing are wide of the mark.    ""VR could be seen by some as gimmicky unless you try it and when you try it you know that there's something there,"" he told Reuters. ""You know that it's bringing something special into people's lives, traveling distances you would never do yourself.""     Alido Di Diovanni, President of Summit, Canadian software solutions providers, believes VR's future is very bright. ""You can have 360 (degree) video streams all round the world, operators can send feeds, for instance, from sporting events, from museums, restaurants, and so forth,"" he said. ""Users could connect to those VR streams and as they connect to them they can engage users within that space, and they can engage users who maybe don't have to have off-the-shelf phones. So a user may have got a phone from an operator that supports standard based video calling. You'd see a user net VR space and you'd be able to click on them and actually initiate a video call with that user overlaid on a 360 stream.""     The MWC ends on February 25.",2016-02-25,MSFT,"Thu Feb 25, 2016 | 5:51am EST",Virtual reality takes center stage at MWC,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-virtualreality-idUSKCN0VY1A8?type=companyNews,0.9873,0.005,0.925,0.07
937,"   By Sarah McBride | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) planned on Monday to announce its move into a new business, unveiling a database software that works with a rival to its Windows operating system, a move that takes aim at a market long dominated by Oracle Corp (ORCL.N). Microsoft's new database product will work with the Linux operating system. The move is the latest to show Microsoft’s increasing willingness to work with competing products, a radical change for the once fiercely protective company.Microsoft's more open strategy has become a hallmark of Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella since he took over in 2014.In an era of exploding amounts of data, much of it used by companies trying to win more business and establish competitive edges, data management has become critically important.Overall database-software sales, well north of $30 billion, have kept rising even though spending in information technology has been generally lackluster, said Gartner analyst Merv Adrian. “If you look at the companies that are transforming and disrupting industries, it is often with data at the core,” said Scott Guthrie, executive vice president for cloud and enterprise at Microsoft. “All of them are using data in a much richer way now to understand their customers.”He cited electronic signature company DocuSign as a longstanding customer of SQL Server, the database product that is expanding to Linux. So is Renault Sport, which uses sensors that collect myriad data points to hone performance of Formula One racing teams. Microsoft’s SQL Server business ranks behind No. 1 Oracle, which has more than 40 percent market share in database software and works with Linux, Adrian said. Microsoft has 21.5 percent of the market, he said, pushing International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) from second to third place in 2013. The product is one of Microsoft’s biggest business lines. SAP SE (SAPG.DE) also competes in the area.Until now, Microsoft on-premises database software worked only with its own Windows operating system. Now it will work with Linux, which has gained significant traction in recent years.  “Larry’s not going to lose any sleep,” said Adrian, referring to Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, “but yes, they’ll notice it. It’s a significant competitive threat they didn’t have before.”It was unclear how many customers Microsoft will win for its Linux product, which will be in preview mode until mid 2017.Under Nadella, Microsoft has made many products compatible with other systems, including Apple’s iOS. Late last year, it opened its cloud service, Azure, to customers of Red Hat(RHT.N), a company that makes a popular version of Linux.

941,"   By Eric Auchard | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT A group of former Skype technologists, backed by the co-founder of the messaging platform, has introduced a new version of its own messaging service that promises end-to-end encryption for all conversations, including by video.Wire, a 50-person start-up mostly made up of engineers, is stepping into a global political debate over encryption that pits privacy against security advocates, epitomized by the standoff between the U.S. government and Apple.The company said on Thursday it was adding video calling to a package of private communications services that go beyond existing messaging providers.Rivals such as Facebook's Messenger and WhatsApp or  Telegram offer encryption on only parts of a message's journey or for a specific set of services, it said. Wire, which is based in Switzerland relays communications through its network of cloud computers but user communications are stored, in encrypted form, on their own devices. It delivers privacy protections that are always on, even when callers use multiple devices, such as a phone or desktop PC simultaneously. This comprehensive approach poses fresh challenges to law enforcers, who often seek to exploit gaps in encryption in  criminal or security investigations. ""We believe Wire is unique in the industry with always-on encryption for all conversation(s), in groups or 1:1, with simultaneous support for multiple devices,"" Wire Chief Technology Officer Alan Duric said in a statement.""Everything is end-to-end encrypted: That means voice and video calls, texts, pictures, graphics - all the content you can send,"" Wire Executive Chairman Janus Friis told Reuters.The Danish entrepreneur was a co-founder of Skype, first released in 2003, which was later sold to a series of owners and is now a unit of Microsoft Corp. Wire launched the first version of its self-titled communications app late in 2014 to limited notice because it offered encrypted calling and text services similar to a dozen other apps, distinguished mainly by crystal-clear voice quality. The app relies on standard, open-source encryption techniques, which allows outside technical experts to evaluate the security of its products rather than relying on trust.Technical details can be found at wire.com/privacy/ Wire receives financial backing from Iconical, a group of designers, engineers and executives that act as alternative to traditional venture capital investors. Friis invests in Wire as part of Iconical.It has not disclosed how much funding it has received. A key selling point for Wire is that it protects users from advertising. Like many start-ups in this area, it is seeking to grow quickly and discover a sustainable business model later.(This version of the story makes clear that user communications are stored on their own devices in paragraph 5) (Editing by Mark Potter)",2016-03-11,MSFT,"Fri Mar 11, 2016 | 8:05am EST","Skype co-founder launches ultra-private messaging, with video",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-dataprotection-messaging-wire-idUSKCN0WC2GM?type=companyNews,0.9645,0.019,0.905,0.076

950,"   By Alex Dobuzinskis | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Microsoft is ""deeply sorry"" for the racist and sexist Twitter messages generated by the so-called chatbot it launched this week, a company official wrote on Friday, after the artificial intelligence program went on an embarrassing tirade.The bot, known as Tay, was designed to become ""smarter"" as more users interacted with it. Instead, it quickly learned to parrot a slew of anti-Semitic and other hateful invective that human Twitter users started feeding the program, forcing Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to shut it down on Thursday.Following the setback, Microsoft said in a blog post it would revive Tay only if its engineers could find a way to prevent Web users from influencing the chatbot in ways that undermine the company's principles and values.""We are deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from Tay, which do not represent who we are or what we stand for, nor how we designed Tay,"" wrote Peter Lee, Microsoft's vice president of research. Microsoft created Tay as an experiment to learn more about how artificial intelligence programs can engage with Web users in casual conversation. The project was designed to interact with and ""learn"" from the young generation of millennials. Tay began its short-lived Twitter tenure on Wednesday with a handful of innocuous tweets. Then its posts took a dark turn.In one typical example, Tay tweeted: ""feminism is cancer,"" in response to another Twitter user who had posted the same message.

951,"   By Alex Dobuzinskis | LOS ANGELES  LOS ANGELES Microsoft is ""deeply sorry"" for the racist and sexist Twitter messages generated by the so-called chatbot it launched this week, a company official wrote on Friday, after the artificial intelligence program went on an embarrassing tirade.The bot, known as Tay, was designed to become ""smarter"" as more users interacted with it. Instead, it quickly learned to parrot a slew of anti-Semitic and other hateful invective that human Twitter users started feeding the program, forcing Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to shut it down on Thursday.Following the setback, Microsoft said in a blog post it would revive Tay only if its engineers could find a way to prevent Web users from influencing the chatbot in ways that undermine the company's principles and values.""We are deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from Tay, which do not represent who we are or what we stand for, nor how we designed Tay,"" wrote Peter Lee, Microsoft's vice president of research. Microsoft created Tay as an experiment to learn more about how artificial intelligence programs can engage with Web users in casual conversation. The project was designed to interact with and ""learn"" from the young generation of millennials. Tay began its short-lived Twitter tenure on Wednesday with a handful of innocuous tweets. Then its posts took a dark turn.In one typical example, Tay tweeted: ""feminism is cancer,"" in response to another Twitter user who had posted the same message. Lee, in the blog post, called Web users' efforts to exert a malicious influence on the chatbot ""a coordinated attack by a subset of people.""  ""Although we had prepared for many types of abuses of the system, we had made a critical oversight for this specific attack,"" Lee wrote.

952,"   By Kshitiz Goliya  Online music streaming service Pandora Media Inc (P.N) appointed founder Tim Westergren as its chief executive to replace Brian McAndrews, who left the company on Monday, sending its shares down 10 percent.The company also appointed independent board member Jim Feuille as chairman and promoted chief strategy officer Sara Clemens to chief operating officer.Westergren, who co-founded the service in 2000, earlier served as the company's CEO from May 2002 to July 2004.McAndrews, who took over as CEO in September 2013, also serves on the board of New York Times Co (NYT.N) and GrubHub Inc (GRUB.N).McAndrews is known for his leadership of online display advertising company aQuantive Inc, which Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) bought in 2007 for $6 billion after paying an 85 percent premium. Pandora, whose shares had fallen 32.5 percent in the last 12 months, faces stiff competition from Spotify, Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Apple Music and Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O).""I'm sure the stock performance was a factor in McAndrews' departure,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter told Reuters.Pandora last month reported disappointing fourth-quarter results with active listeners of 81.1 million at the end of December, a slight fall from a year earlier. The company had said it planned to invest $345 million in 2016 to expand its paid subscription service and enter new markets, with an aim to achieve $4 billion in revenue by 2020. It reported revenue of $1.16 billion for 2015.""McAndrews was pretty ambitious, and my guess is that Westergren will be a bit more deliberate, so we will likely see a slower roll out of their international expansion,"" Pachter said. Pandora held discussions about selling itself, the New York Times reported last month. However, the company later said it was focused on working as an independent company.""With the co-founder returning, a sale is less likely,"" Pachter added.Pandora's shares were down 9.6 percent at $9.88 at midday.

957,"   By Andrei Makhovsky | MINSK  MINSK World of Tanks, one of the five most popular PC video games in Europe and the United States with 100 million players joining virtual battles in World War II-era tanks, started in a kitchen in the capital of Belarus. In a country better known for its Soviet-era collectivized farming and run by President Alexander Lukashenko, seen by some as ""Europe's last dictator"", the software industry is thriving thanks to highly-educated and low-cost engineers. Despite its international success, World of Tanks developer Wargaming has kept a major operation at the high-tech park in Minsk, along with a dozens other companies including U.S.-based EPAM Systems (EPAM.N), founded by two Belarusians in 1993. Belarusian software engineers are also behind Japanese-controlled Viber messenger and the MSQRD selfie app bought by Facebook (FB.O) earlier this month.The sector has flourished despite a wider economic slump, raising hopes that it could set an example for an overhaul of the mostly state-run economy, and attracting foreign workers, expatriate Belarusians and locals to jobs that pay about five times the average wage.World of Tanks software developer Andrei Safronov's hobby is drawing 3D models of tanks. ""I was noticed, invited, and now I work here,"" the Russian said, showing off tank models on his computer screen in a shining 16-storey building in the industrial park where workers relax playing table football or video games on big screens.World of Tanks, owned by Cyprus-based Wargaming, is the fifth most popular PC gaming title behind League of Legends, Counter-Strike, World of Warcraft, all produced by U.S. publishers, plus Minecraft, the Swedish game now owned by Microsoft Corp.Companies at capital's high-tech zone contribute 1.5 percent of Belarus's GDP, employ 24,000 people and last year had exports worth $700 million. By contrast, the state-run Gomselmash, employing 14,000, sold just one combine-harvester in the month of December, contributing to 2015 exports of just $90 million.The economy shrank 4 percent last year, hit by a recession and international sanctions in neighbor Russia but the software park grew 20 percent and is expected to do the same in 2016.  PROUD PRESIDENT Such growth has been helped by the low levels of government interference, raising hopes that it could be used as a model for transforming the state-run economy.   Lukashenko came to power in 1994 after the collapse of the Soviet Union and his country until February was under EU sanctions for his human rights record that included concerns about freedom of speech.Some opposition media outlets broadcast from nearby countries to evade censorship and the state telecom monopoly is the exclusive provider of Internet connections to the outside world. Reporters Without Borders ranked Belarus 157th out of 180 countries in the 2015 press freedom Index.But Lukashenko, who once called the internet ""garbage"", has left the technology sector alone and now seems proud of his country's IT prowess.

Now they are making headway developing name-brand products known around the world. Set up ten years ago, the park was the brainchild of former Belarusian ambassador to Washington and Lukashenko supporter Valery Tsepkalo who met successful Belarusian engineers in the United States and wanted them to be able to work at home.The park does not get money from the state but benefits from tax breaks and the ability to tap an educated workforce.  Belarus has a strong tradition of science and engineering education, as do many other former Soviet states - Tetris, the popular cube game was invented by a Soviet programmer working at Moscow's Academy of Sciences in 1984. Belarus's 54 universities produce 4,000 software engineers every year.""The most important factor (for being in Belarus) are strong schools of training for professional engineers,"" said Jaroslav Tomilchik, EPAM's human resources director in Minsk.  The low cost of living and the country's position outside the European Union also helps keeps wage costs down compared to nearby EU members.But success may bring pay rises, particularly as engineers move away from contracts and develop their own companies.

964,"   By Sarah McBride | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Corp has sued the U.S. government for the right to tell its customers when a federal agency is looking at their emails, the latest in a series of clashes over privacy between the technology industry and Washington.The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in federal court in Seattle, argues that the government is violating the U.S. Constitution by preventing Microsoft from notifying thousands of customers about government requests for their emails and other documents.The government's actions contravene the Fourth Amendment, which establishes the right for people and businesses to know if the government searches or seizes their property, the suit argues, and Microsoft's First Amendment right to free speech.The Department of Justice is reviewing the filing, spokeswoman Emily Pierce said.Microsoft's suit focuses on the storage of data on remote servers, rather than locally on people's computers, which Microsoft says has provided a new opening for the government to access electronic data.Using the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), the government is increasingly directing investigations at the parties that store data in the so-called cloud, Microsoft says in the lawsuit. The 30-year-old law has long drawn scrutiny from technology companies and privacy advocates who say it was written before the rise of the commercial Internet and is therefore outdated.""People do not give up their rights when they move their private information from physical storage to the cloud,"" Microsoft says in the lawsuit.

965,"   By Sarah McBride | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has sued the U.S. government for the right to tell its customers when a federal agency is looking at their emails, the latest in a series of clashes over privacy between the technology industry and Washington.The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in federal court in Seattle, argues that the government is violating the U.S. Constitution by preventing Microsoft from notifying thousands of customers about government requests for their emails and other documents.The government’s actions contravene the Fourth Amendment, which establishes the right for people and businesses to know if the government searches or seizes their property, the suit argues, and Microsoft's First Amendment right to free speech.The Department of Justice is reviewing the filing, spokeswoman Emily Pierce said.Microsoft’s suit focuses on the storage of data on remote servers, rather than locally on people's computers, which Microsoft says has provided a new opening for the government to access electronic data. Using the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), the government is increasingly directing investigations at the parties that store data in the so-called cloud, Microsoft says in the lawsuit. The 30-year-old law has long drawn scrutiny from technology companies and privacy advocates who say it was written before the rise of the commercial Internet and is therefore outdated.“People do not give up their rights when they move their private information from physical storage to the cloud,” Microsoft says in the lawsuit.

""But the position Microsoft is taking in this suit is that it should be extraordinary and it shouldn’t be a matter of course that there is a gag order automatically put in,” he said in an interview with Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen Adler.The lawsuit, filed last week in federal court in Microsoft's home town of Seattle, argues that the government is violating the U.S. Constitution by preventing Microsoft from notifying thousands of customers about government requests for their emails and other documents, sometimes indefinitely. The move comes as rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is locked in a showdown with the U.S. government over access to an iPhone belonging to one of the killers in the December shooting in San Bernardino, California.Gates said more collaboration between law enforcement and privacy advocates would help determine which “legislative framework ... strikes the perfect balance” on government access to private data.“I don’t think there are any absolutists who think the government should be able to get everything or the government should be able to get nothing,” Gates, 60, said.

975,"   By Dustin Volz and David Shepardson | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Bill Gates said on Monday that no one was an “absolutist” on either side of the digital privacy debate, but the co-founder of Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said he supports his company’s lawsuit against the U.S. government seeking the freedom to tell customers when federal agencies have sought their data.""There probably are some cases where (the government) should be able to go in covertly and get information about a company’s email,"" Gates said at a Reuters Newsmaker event in Washington. ""But the position Microsoft is taking in this suit is that it should be extraordinary and it shouldn’t be a matter of course that there is a gag order automatically put in,” he said in an interview with Reuters Editor-in-Chief Stephen Adler.The lawsuit, filed last week in federal court in Microsoft's home town of Seattle, argues that the government is violating the U.S. Constitution by preventing Microsoft from notifying thousands of customers about government requests for their emails and other documents, sometimes indefinitely. The move comes as rival Apple Inc (AAPL.O) is locked in a showdown with the U.S. government over access to an iPhone belonging to one of the killers in the December shooting in San Bernardino, California.Gates said more collaboration between law enforcement and privacy advocates would help determine which “legislative framework ... strikes the perfect balance” on government access to private data.“I don’t think there are any absolutists who think the government should be able to get everything or the government should be able to get nothing,” Gates, 60, said. The man who co-founded Microsoft in 1975 and is still held in reverence by the technology world made waves in February when he appeared to distance himself from Apple in its legal fight with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, but later clarified his comments and said that headlines suggesting he supported the FBI’s position were inaccurate.Gates, the world's richest person, also talked about the work of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the philanthropic organization he formed in 2000, which has an endowment of more than $40 billion. The foundation, where Gates works day to day, has focused attention in recent months on the Zika outbreak, which has been linked to thousands of suspected cases of microcephaly, a rare birth defect, in Brazil and is affecting large parts of Latin America and the Caribbean. The World Health Organization declared the outbreak an international health emergency on Feb. 1. Gates said the foundation would be contributing funds to aid in the Zika fight, but did not say how much.Private sector and governments need to work together to quickly roll out products to combat Zika and other mosquito-borne diseases, Gates said.""Zika is a tough one,"" he said.

985,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK, April 21  NEW YORK, April 21 Even with a spate of high-profile earnings disappointments in recent days from the likes of Caterpillar, Microsoft and Google's parent company, the profit recession that has dogged U.S. stocks since last fall is still expected to come to an end in the second half of this year.But while that probably protects Wall Street from another vicious downdraft like the one that came with the start of the year, the return to positive earnings growth is unlikely to drive prices sharply higher, and buying stocks now with the market back near its record high could prove a rough bet.""There's no clear driver that I can see that is going to ignite growth in the real economy. We continue to limp along,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.The S&P 500 tech sector on Friday posted its largest percentage decline in 11 weeks after Microsoft  and Alphabet both missed analysts' expectations.However, the index overall was doing something close to nothing, and is expected to remain in a tight range. Investors are not willing to pay much more for earnings that are expected at best to inch up for the year.In that environment, investors are likely paying as much as they are willing to pay for stocks, said Forrest. The S&P's forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at 17.8, meaning investors are paying nearly $18 for every $1 in expected earnings over the next 12 months. That is the highest since 2004 and sharply above the average 15 level over the past 30 years, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream data.EARNINGS BOTTOMING Reported and estimated earnings for the S&P 500 are seen down 7.1 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, after having declined 2.9 percent and 0.8 percent year-on-year in the previous two quarters. The second quarter of this year is also expected to post a contraction, though a much smaller one at negative 2.3 percent. Earnings are then expected to post gains of 4.3 percent and 10.3 percent in the third and fourth quarters, leaving the gains for the full year shy of 2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.The S&P 500 is already up more than 2 percent this year, meaning that any further gains would come at the expense of a higher multiple.""The overall earnings guidance in some of the reports has disappointed and the forward guidance is not as positive as we would hope given the overall expectations that we are going through the worst of it now,"" said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta. The weaker-then-expected results from Microsoft and Alphabet, the second- and third-largest U.S. companies by market capitalization, add to a list of underwhelming reports from the likes of IBM, Intel and Nike.The S&P, however, has risen more than 15 percent from its 2016 low hit in February and stands less than 2 percent away from its record close set almost a year ago.""You've got to be a little more cautious here about stocks given the big rally,"" said Andrew Slimmon, portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in Chicago.""The estimates have beaten a little but it's reaffirmation of very anemic earnings growth year over year. At this juncture, we are setting up for a repeat of last year, which is barely positive year-over-year earnings growth.""More than 800 companies from micro- to large caps report earnings next week.

993,"   By Rodrigo Campos | NEW YORK  NEW YORK HaveEven with a spate of high-profile earnings disappointments in recent days from the likes of Caterpillar, Microsoft and Google's parent company, the profit recession that has dogged U.S. stocks since last fall is still expected to come to an end in the second half of this year.But while that probably protects Wall Street from another vicious downdraft like the one that came with the start of the year, the return to positive earnings growth is unlikely to drive prices sharply higher, and buying stocks now with the market back near its record high could prove a rough bet.""There’s no clear driver that I can see that is going to ignite growth in the real economy. We continue to limp along,"" said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.The S&P 500 tech sector .SPLRCT on Friday posted its largest percentage decline in 11 weeks after Microsoft (MSFT.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) both missed analysts' expectations.    However, the index overall .SPX was doing something close to nothing, and is expected to remain in a tight range. Investors are not willing to pay much more for earnings that are expected at best to inch up for the year.In that environment, investors are likely paying as much as they are willing to pay for stocks, said Forrest.The S&P's forward price-to-earnings ratio stands at 17.8, meaning investors are paying nearly $18 for every $1 in expected earnings over the next 12 months. That is the highest since 2004 and sharply above the average 15 level over the past 30 years, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream data. EARNINGS BOTTOMING Reported and estimated earnings for the S&P 500 are seen down 7.1 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, after having declined 2.9 percent and 0.8 percent year-on-year in the previous two quarters. The second quarter of this year is also expected to post a contraction, though a much smaller one at negative 2.3 percent.Earnings are then expected to post gains of 4.3 percent and 10.3 percent in the third and fourth quarters, leaving the gains for the full year shy of 2 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.The S&P 500 is already up more than 2 percent this year, meaning that any further gains would come at the expense of a higher multiple. “The overall earnings guidance in some of the reports has disappointed and the forward guidance is not as positive as we would hope given the overall expectations that we are going through the worst of it now,"" said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta.The weaker-then-expected results from Microsoft and Alphabet, the second- and third-largest U.S. companies by market capitalization, add to a list of underwhelming reports from the likes of IBM (IBM.N), Intel (INTC.O) and Nike (NKE.N).The S&P, however, has risen more than 15 percent from its 2016 low hit in February and stands less than 2 percent away from its record close set almost a year ago.""You’ve got to be a little more cautious here about stocks given the big rally,"" said Andrew Slimmon, portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management in Chicago. ""The estimates have beaten a little but it’s reaffirmation of very anemic earnings growth year over year. At this juncture, we are setting up for a repeat of last year, which is barely positive year-over-year earnings growth.""More than 800 companies from micro- to large caps report earnings next week. The headline of the list is Apple (AAPL.O), expected to report Tuesday at 5 p.m. EDT.

997,"   By Julia Love and Anya George Tharakan  Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Tuesday posted its first-ever decline in iPhone sales and its first revenue drop in 13 years as the company credited with inventing the smartphone struggles with an increasingly saturated market.The company's sales dropped by more than a quarter in China, its most important market after the United States, and it also forecast another disappointing quarter for global revenues.Its shares fell about 8 percent, dropping below $100 for the first time since February. A hike in Apple's share buyback and  dividend as well as bumper revenue from services failed to mollify investors.Apple's results followed disappointing quarterly reports from Microsoft Corp(MSFT.O) and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), and microblog Twitter (TWTR.N) also on Tuesday reported results that missed expectations.Apple said it sold 51.2 million iPhones in its second fiscal quarter, down from 61.2 million in the same quarter a year ago but above analysts' estimates of about 50 million devices. While Apple executives had predicted iPhone sales would decline this quarter, they must reassure investors that the drop  represents a momentary roadblock, rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise.After years of blockbuster sales, many investors fear the iPhone has reached saturation, spelling the end for Apple's exponential growth.""Apple needs to come up with a radical new innovation or product rather than just the current incremental improvements to existing products. This is the only way in which it will reinvigorate sales growth,"" said Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino.Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that the success of the iPhone 6 a year earlier had set a difficult bar to beat in the second quarter. ""The iPhone 6 is an anomaly,"" he said.  But Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts that the smartphone market was not growing, reinforcing wider concerns of saturation. Cook also conceded that the iPhone 6S was driving customers to replace phones at a much lower rate than the 6. ""I don't mean just a hair lower; it's a lot lower,"" he said. ""If we'd had the same rate on 6S as 6, it would be time for a huge party.""He pointed to the services division, which includes Apple Music and the App Store, as a bright spot. Its revenue grew 20 percent to $6 billion and surpassed iMac and iPad sales.Cook also hinted that Apple had more gadgets to come.     ""The future of Apple is very bright,"" he said. ""Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store."" Earnings of $1.90 per share fell short of the average analyst estimate of $2 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue of $50.56 billion missed expectations of $51.97 billion.  Apple forecast third-quarter revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion, short of the Wall Street consensus of $47.3 billion. Apple also said it was raising its capital return program by $50 billion through a $35 billion increase in its share buyback authorization and a 10 percent rise in the quarterly dividend.iPHONE SE DEMAND STRONG In March, Apple released the iPhone SE, a smaller, 4-inch-screen phone featuring much of the company's latest technology. Although sales of the phone were not captured in the second quarter, the device is off to a strong start, particularly in emerging markets, Maestri said. ""The situation right now around the world is that we are supply-constrained,"" he said. ""The demand has been very, very strong."" Although Apple's revenue in Greater China fell 26 percent from the year-ago quarter, Maestri stressed that the company was ""extremely optimistic"" about China. ""We continue to make a lot of investment there,"" he said.Cook said that mainland China sales were down only 7 percent in constant currency, attributing much of the Greater China drop to Hong Kong, where strength in the local dollar, which is pegged to U.S. currency, deterred tourist shopping. The company did not comment on prospects for its iBooks Stores and iTunes Movie service, which were shut down last week in China.The drop in after-hours shares wipes out roughly $46 billion in market capitalization, roughly the value of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N). In reaction to Apple's results, shares of its suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), Qorvo (QRVO.O), Broadcom (AVGO.O) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) all fell 2 percent or more on Tuesday.

It did not say how many employees currently work on smartphones in the group as a whole.Shares of Microsoft were trading around $52 late Wednesday, roughly flat with their $51.59 close Tuesday, but significantly up from $34.20 when Nadella became CEO in February 2014. Remaking Microsoft, known primarily for its software, into a more device-focused company was a hallmark of previous chief executive Steve Ballmer. In one of his last major acts, Ballmer closed a deal to buy Nokia's struggling but once-dominant handset business for about $7.2 billion in late 2013. The deal closed in April 2014, two months after Nadella became CEO.Since then, Nadella has shaved away at the phone business, starting with a 2015 restructuring that put the devices group, previously a stand-alone unit under former Nokia chief Stephen Elop, under the Windows group. Run by Terry Myerson, the Windows division is the company's biggest.A Finnish union representative told Reuters the cuts would essentially put an end to Microsoft's development of new phones. ""My understanding is that Windows 10 will go on as an operating system, but there will be no more phones made by Microsoft,"" said Kalle Kiili, a shop steward.Microsoft said in a statement it would continue to develop the Windows 10 platform and support its Lumia smartphones, but gave no comment on whether it would develop new Windows phones. Global market share of Windows smartphones fell below 1 percent in the first quarter of 2016, according to research firm Gartner. Last year, Microsoft announced $7.5 billion of writedowns and 7,800 job cuts in its phone business. Earlier this month, Microsoft sold its entry-level feature phones business for $350 million.The company said on Wednesday it expected to cut all 1,350 jobs at its Finnish mobile phone unit and close down a research and development site in the country.

Nokia dominated around 40 percent of the world's mobile phone industry in 2008 before it was eclipsed by the rise of touch-screen smartphones.As a result, Nokia and Microsoft have slashed thousands of Finnish jobs over the past decade, and the lack of substitute jobs is the main reason for the country's current economic stagnation.Nokia, now focused on telecom network equipment, just last week said it was cutting around 1,000 jobs in Finland following its acquisition of Franco-American rival Alcatel-Lucent.The Microsoft phone business still has a dedicated fan in Ballmer, who bragged about his device at a San Francisco dinner hosted by Fortune in March.""It's a Windows phone,"" he said as the audience laughed.

1030,"   By Sarah McBride  Microsoft Corp will buy LinkedIn Corp  for $26.2 billion in its biggest-ever deal, a bold stroke by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in his efforts to make the venerable software company a major force in next-generation computing.By connecting widely used software like Microsoft Word and PowerPoint with LinkedIn's network of 433 million professionals, the combination could enable Microsoft to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products and potentially challenge cloud software rivals such as Salesforce.com Inc. .""LinkedIn and Microsoft really share a mission"" of helping people work more efficiently, said Microsoft CEO Nadella in a conference call with analysts. ""There is no better way to realize that mission than to connect the world's professionals.""The $196-per-share price tag represented a premium of almost 50 percent over LinkedIn's stock market value as of Friday, but was still well below the social media company's all-time high of $270. Analysts said the price was rich, and Microsoft's stock closed down 2.7 percent at $50.14.Still, there was cautious optimism that this could be one of the relatively few tech mega-mergers that works out well. ""It's a massive growth play for Microsoft,"" said Forrester analyst Ted Schadler.The deal may also help spur further mergers and acquisitions in the tech sector, where a broad correction is bringing down the prices of public and private companies even as a handful of major players sit on large cash piles.For LinkedIn, founded in 2002 and launched the following year by Reid Hoffman, one of Silicon Valley's most-visible investors and entrepreneurs, the sale marks the end of a classic startup run: funding from top-tier venture capitalists, a long period of building the company and developing a revenue base, then a big initial public offering, followed by a roller-coaster stock price and finally an acquisition.The company's growth has slowed recently and investors have become far more cautious on the high valuations of many tech companies - both of which likely figured into LinkedIn's decision to sell, analysts said.For Microsoft, the LinkedIn deal is a chance to reverse a terrible track record with acquisitions, including paying $9.4 billion for phone maker Nokia in 2014, $1.2 billion for business network Yammer in 2012, $8.5 billion for video-calling tool Skype in 2011, and $6.3 billion for ad business aQuantive in 2007. In 2012, it wrote down its aQuantive acquisition by $6.2 billion, and its cumulative writedowns for Nokia total $8.55 billion.The LinkedIn acquisition could also help Microsoft play to its strengths in analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, Nadella said on the investor call. LinkedIn and Microsoft both have enormous amount of data about their customers that can potentially be mined to offer automated suggestions and other features that make business processes quicker and simpler.Microsoft noted that the deal brings in a big new customer base: after adding in LinkedIn, the total potential market size of Microsoft's productivity and business-process segment sits at $315 billion, up from $200 billion without LinkedIn. Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the deal would be financed mainly with debt, a way for the cash-rich company to reduce its tax bill. The company has $105 billion in cash and other liquid assets. Moody's said it was reviewing Microsoft's rare AAA debt rating for a possible downgrade.LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner will remain with the company, which will be operated as a separate unit and retain its name.CHASING GROWTH Nadella has been trying to reinvigorate Microsoft since taking over the lumbering giant two years ago, and has helped build more credibility around the company's efforts in areas such as cloud-based services. When he took the top job in February 2014, the company's share price was $34.20; early Monday afternoon, it was trading around $50. With LinkedIn, Nadella is solidifying Microsoft's focus on the business market, where it has retained a much stronger position than it has in the smartphone-centric consumer technology business.In touting the synergies of the deal, Nadella gave an example of a customer walking into a meeting scheduled on a Microsoft Outlook calendar integrated with LinkedIn. That person might receive notification that one of the people in the meeting went to college with a colleague, enabling another level of connection.""The future of productivity is around people, identity and data and the relationships between the them,"" said Matt McIlwain, a portfolio manager at Madrona Ventures.""Microsoft is buying LinkedIn for the opportunity to leverage these capabilities and combine them with Microsoft's strong but complementary assets in those three areas.""The strategy in many ways is similar to that of Salesforce.com, whose CEO, Marc Benioff, just last month told investors he believed artificial intelligence and machine learning would drive growth at his company.Salesforce.com had once been considered a possible Microsoft acquisition target. Despite Microsoft's weak track record in M&A, the one prior major deal on Nadella's watch - the $2.5 billion purchase of video game maker Minecraft in 2014 - is generally considered a success, complementing Microsoft's work on augmented-reality projects such as the HoloLens headset.Weiner of LinkedIn said on a call with Reuters that he met Nadella two years ago at the Microsoft CEO Summit - a meeting of top executives at the software company's campus near Seattle - and started serious talks about an acquisition in February. That was shortly after LinkedIn's stock fell by 40 percent following a weak earnings report.TWITTER NEXT? Weiner added LinkedIn would remain its own entity in the way that YouTube is relatively independent from parent Alphabet Inc , or Instagram from parent Facebook Inc. That could ease concerns that users might have about Microsoft being in control of their professional information - though the kind of integration Nadella cited suggests that LinkedIn might not be its own entity forever.Monday's deal raised investors' hopes that another social media company, Twitter Inc, could be the next acquisition target, sending that company's shares up almost 4 percent.The Microsoft-LinkedIn deal, which won the unanimous support of both boards, is expected to close this year, the companies said.After the deal, which will require approval from regulators in the United States, the European Union, Canada and Brazil, LinkedIn will become part of Microsoft's productivity and business processes unit, the companies said. That unit generated $6.52 billion of Microsoft's $20.53 billion in revenue last quarter.Microsoft's financial adviser was Morgan Stanley and LinkedIn's financial adviser was Allen & Company LLC and Qatalyst Partners, founded by Silicon Valley dealmaker Frank Quattrone.Microsoft's legal adviser was Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and Professional Corp advised LinkedIn.",2016-06-13,MSFT,"Mon Jun 13, 2016 | 7:42pm EDT",Microsoft to buy LinkedIn for $26.2 bln in its largest deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/linkedin-ma-microsoft-idUSL1N1950LX?type=companyNews,0.9986,0.023,0.861,0.116

1034,"   By Julia Love and Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Apple Inc is opening its popular Siri digital assistant to outside developers, which means iPhone users could soon be able to hail rides with Uber, publish photos on Shutterfly or make a call on Skype with voice commands. The move, announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco on Monday, is Apple's latest attempt to spruce up the iPhone experience as sales of the best-selling product flag.The world's best-known technology company also gave a demonstration of Siri on the Mac computer, which for the first time will be able to search for photos, documents, music and other files via voice commands. Siri will also work similarly with Apple TV.Among other revamps, it said its Apple Pay mobile payment system would be able to work for some internet purchases on its Safari browser, including on Mac computers, representing a challenge to PayPal Holdings Inc. Apple is also adding Siri's artificial intelligence to its messaging app, which will get quick access to emojis and new ways to expand and change how texts are displayed.  The presentation was kicked off by Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook asking for a moment of silence for the victims of Sunday's mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. That was followed up by a demonstration of a new operating system for the Apple Watch that opens apps much faster than the previous version, and lets users write messages with their finger on the watch face, including in Chinese. Apple's Siri move was largely foreseen by analysts, and the event itself did not grip investors as some of Apple's product announcements have in the past. Its shares were down 1.1 percent at $97.65 in afternoon trading, near where they were at the start of the presentation.  “Whatever news comes out of it (the conference) might matter to some short-term traders but won’t affect our view on the stock,"" said Mark Mulholland, portfolio manager of the Matthew 25 fund, during the presentation. ""We’re going to hold this stock for at least another three years, because it has such a dominant position in the phone market.” Siri is the most visible aspect of Apple's artificial intelligence program, commonly known as AI. Rivals such as Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc's Google are investing heavily in their own digital assistants, analysts say.      ""Apple just can't stand still in light of this competition,"" said analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies.     Apple acknowledged a number of developers' grievances this month by allowing ads in App Store search results, which gives them a way to stand out in a sea of apps.

1040,"   By Sarah McBride  Microsoft Corp will buy LinkedIn Corp for $26.2 billion in its biggest-ever deal, a bold stroke by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in his efforts to make the venerable software company a major force in next-generation computing.By connecting widely used software like Microsoft Word and PowerPoint with LinkedIn's network of 433 million professionals, the combination could enable Microsoft to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products and potentially challenge cloud software rivals such as Salesforce.com Inc..""LinkedIn and Microsoft really share a mission"" of helping people work more efficiently, said Microsoft CEO Nadella in a conference call with analysts. ""There is no better way to realize that mission than to connect the world's professionals.""The $196-per-share price tag represented a premium of almost 50 percent over LinkedIn's stock market value as of Friday, but was still well below the social media company's all-time high of $270. Analysts said the price was rich, and Microsoft's stock closed down 2.7 percent at $50.14.Still, there was cautious optimism that this could be one of the relatively few tech mega-mergers that works out well. ""It's a massive growth play for Microsoft,"" said Forrester analyst Ted Schadler.The deal may also help spur further mergers and acquisitions in the tech sector, where a broad correction is bringing down the prices of public and private companies even as a handful of major players sit on large cash piles.For LinkedIn, founded in 2002 and launched the following year by Reid Hoffman, one of Silicon Valley's most-visible investors and entrepreneurs, the sale marks the end of a classic startup run: funding from top-tier venture capitalists, a long period of building the company and developing a revenue base, then a big initial public offering, followed by a roller-coaster stock price and finally an acquisition.The company makes most of its $3 billion in annual revenue from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people on what's often known as the social network for business.    The company's growth has slowed recently and investors have become far more cautious on the high valuations of many tech companies - both of which likely figured into LinkedIn's decision to sell, analysts said.For Microsoft, the LinkedIn deal is a chance to reverse a terrible track record with acquisitions, including paying $9.4 billion for phone maker Nokia in 2014 and $6.3 billion for ad business aQuantive in 2007. In 2012, it wrote down its aQuantive acquisition by $6.2 billion, and its cumulative writedowns for Nokia total $8.55 billion.It also paid $1.2 billion for business network Yammer in 2012 and $8.5 billion for video-calling tool Skype in 2011.The LinkedIn acquisition could help Microsoft play to its strengths in analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, Nadella said on the investor call. LinkedIn and Microsoft both have enormous amount of data about their customers that can potentially be mined to offer automated suggestions and other features that make business processes quicker and simpler. Microsoft noted that the deal brings in a big new customer base: after adding in LinkedIn, the total potential market size of Microsoft's productivity and business-process segment sits at $315 billion, up from $200 billion without LinkedIn.Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said the deal would be financed mainly with debt, a way for the cash-rich company to reduce its tax bill. The company has $105 billion in cash and other liquid assets. Moody's said it was reviewing Microsoft's rare AAA debt rating for a possible downgrade.LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner will remain with the company, which will be operated as a separate unit and retain its name.CHASING GROWTH Nadella has been trying to reinvigorate Microsoft since taking over the lumbering giant two years ago, and has helped build more credibility around the company's efforts in areas such as cloud-based services. When he took the top job in February 2014, the company's share price was $34.20; early Monday afternoon, it was trading around $50. With LinkedIn, Nadella is solidifying Microsoft's focus on the business market, where it has retained a much stronger position than it has in the smartphone-centric consumer technology business. In touting the synergies of the deal, Nadella gave an example of a customer walking into a meeting scheduled on a Microsoft Outlook calendar integrated with LinkedIn. That person might receive notification that one of the people in the meeting went to college with a colleague, enabling another level of connection. ""The future of productivity is around people, identity and data and the relationships between the them,"" said Matt McIlwain, a portfolio manager at Madrona Ventures. ""Microsoft is buying LinkedIn for the opportunity to leverage these capabilities and combine them with Microsoft's strong but complementary assets in those three areas.""The strategy in many ways is similar to that of Salesforce.com, whose CEO, Marc Benioff, just last month told investors he believed artificial intelligence and machine learning would drive growth at his company. Salesforce.com had once been considered a possible Microsoft acquisition target. Microsoft has its own salesforce automation product, called Dynamics, and integration with LinkedIn could help it become a much more formidable competitor in that market.  Despite Microsoft's weak track record in M&A, the one prior major deal on Nadella's watch - the $2.5 billion purchase of video game maker Minecraft in 2014 - is generally considered a success, complementing Microsoft's work on augmented-reality projects such as the HoloLens headset.Weiner of LinkedIn said on a call with Reuters that he met Nadella two years ago at the Microsoft CEO Summit - a meeting of top executives at the software company's campus near Seattle - and started serious talks about an acquisition in February. That was shortly after LinkedIn's stock fell by 40 percent following a weak earnings report.TWITTER NEXT? Weiner added LinkedIn would remain its own entity in the way that YouTube is relatively independent from parent Alphabet Inc, or Instagram from parent Facebook Inc. That could ease concerns that users might have about Microsoft being in control of their professional information - though the kind of integration Nadella cited suggests that LinkedIn might not be its own entity forever.Monday's deal raised investors' hopes that another social media company, Twitter Inc, could be the next acquisition target, sending that company's shares up almost 4 percent.The Microsoft-LinkedIn deal, which won the unanimous support of both boards, is expected to close this year, the companies said.After the deal, which will require approval from regulators in the United States, the European Union, Canada and Brazil, LinkedIn will become part of Microsoft's productivity and business processes unit, the companies said. That unit generated $6.52 billion of Microsoft's $20.53 billion in revenue last quarter.Microsoft's financial adviser was Morgan Stanley and LinkedIn's financial adviser was Allen & Company LLC and Qatalyst Partners, founded by Silicon Valley dealmaker Frank Quattrone.Microsoft's legal adviser was Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati and Professional Corp advised LinkedIn.

1041,"   By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed | NEW YORK  NEW YORK This is one condor that will never soar.Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) announcement on Monday that it will buy LinkedIn Corp LNKD.N for $26.2 billion sent shares of the professional social networking firm into the stratosphere.And while that out-of-the-blue news gave most LinkedIn shareholders a big reason to cheer, one trader who had just laid an intricate options bet looks to be smarting from a big loss.On Friday, the largest trade in LinkedIn's options was an ""iron condor,"" a complex strategy that involves buying and selling of call and put options simultaneously.  Buying a call conveys the right to purchase shares at a fixed price in the future, while buying puts conveys the right to sell shares. Selling calls and puts creates the opposite obligation.The trade would have delivered its maximum return if LinkedIn shares effectively flatlined around Friday's level near $131 over the next two months. But then LinkedIn shares shot up 47 percent after the Microsoft news, torpedoing the trade and leaving the trader with an estimated loss of nearly $1 million.The trader, whose identity is not known, bought 500 LinkedIn calls betting on the shares rising above $185 by mid-August, and sold the same number of calls betting on the shares staying below $160 by that date. At the same time, the trader also bought 600 puts that would profit if the shares dipped below $115, and sold the same number of puts that bet the shares would stay above $125.All in, the trader pocketed roughly $275,000 for setting up the trade and would get to keep it all as long as the shares held between $125 and $160 through the August expiration of the options. Instead, with Microsoft offering $196 a share and the stock jumping to north of $192, the position is well under water. The trader stands to lose a little under $1 million, according to a Reuters calculation.""A day after you sell it, there is a buyout - I would call it the worst-case scenario,"" Henry Schwartz, president at options analytics firm Trade Alert said.

1044,"   By Julia Love and Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Apple Inc is opening its popular Siri digital assistant to outside developers, which means iPhone users could soon be able to hail rides with Uber, publish photos on Shutterfly or make a call on Skype with voice commands. The move, announced at its Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco on Monday, is Apple's latest attempt to spruce up the iPhone experience as sales of the best-selling product flag.The world's best-known technology company also gave a demonstration of Siri on the Mac computer, which for the first time will be able to search for photos, documents, music and other files via voice commands. Siri will also work similarly with Apple TV.Among other revamps, it said its Apple Pay mobile payment system would be able to work for some internet purchases on its Safari browser, including on Mac computers, representing a challenge to PayPal Holdings Inc. Apple is also adding Siri's artificial intelligence to its messaging app, which will get quick access to emojis and new ways to expand and change how texts are displayed.  The presentation was kicked off by Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook asking for a moment of silence for the victims of Sunday's mass shooting in Orlando, Florida. That was followed up by a demonstration of a new operating system for the Apple Watch that opens apps much faster than the previous version, and lets users write messages with their finger on the watch face, including in Chinese. Apple's Siri move was largely foreseen by analysts, and the event itself did not grip investors as some of Apple's product announcements have in the past. Its shares were down 1.1 percent at $97.65 in afternoon trading, near where they were at the start of the presentation.  “Whatever news comes out of it (the conference) might matter to some short-term traders but won’t affect our view on the stock,"" said Mark Mulholland, portfolio manager of the Matthew 25 fund, during the presentation. ""We’re going to hold this stock for at least another three years, because it has such a dominant position in the phone market.” Siri is the most visible aspect of Apple's artificial intelligence program, commonly known as AI. Rivals such as Microsoft Corp and Alphabet Inc's Google are investing heavily in their own digital assistants, analysts say.      ""Apple just can't stand still in light of this competition,"" said analyst Tim Bajarin of Creative Strategies.     Apple acknowledged a number of developers' grievances this month by allowing ads in App Store search results, which gives them a way to stand out in a sea of apps. And it will give developers a bigger cut of revenues on subscription apps.

The case is now before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.Microsoft and industry group HR Policy Association submitted a joint brief on Tuesday opposing the NLRB ruling in a case involving California waste management company Browning-Ferris Industries, a subsidiary of Republic Services Inc.In its brief Microsoft said the 2015 ruling was too broad and the decision would discourage Microsoft and others from directing contractors to provide benefits to their employees, for fear the directive would make Microsoft a joint employer under the new standard.

""The focus of those provisions is protection of a user's privacy interests.""Microsoft had been challenging a warrant seeking emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland, in a narcotics case.It was believed to be the first U.S. company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the country.Thursday's decision reversed a July 2014 ruling by then-Chief Judge Loretta Preska of U.S. district court in Manhattan requiring Microsoft to turn over the emails.

But Judge Carney said limiting the reach of warrants serves ""the interest of comity"" that normally governs cross-border criminal investigations.She said that comity is also reflected in treaties between the United States and all European Union countries, including Ireland, to assist each other in such probes.Some law enforcement officials have said obtaining such assistance can, nonetheless, be cumbersome and time-consuming.The Justice Department is working on a bilateral plan to streamline how U.S. and British authorities request data from companies in each other's country.A bipartisan bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate in May to clarify when and where law enforcement may access electronic communications of U.S. citizens.

1068,"   By Jonathan Stempel | NEW YORK  NEW YORK A federal appeals court on Thursday said the U.S. government cannot force Microsoft Corp and other companies to turn over customer emails stored on servers outside the United States.The 3-0 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan is a defeat for the U.S. Department of Justice and a victory for privacy advocates and for technology companies offering cloud computing and other services around the world.Circuit Judge Susan Carney said communications held by U.S. service providers on servers outside the United States are beyond the reach of domestic search warrants issued under the Stored Communications Act, a 1986 federal law.""Congress did not intend the SCA's warrant provisions to apply extraterritorially,"" she wrote. ""The focus of those provisions is protection of a user's privacy interests.""Microsoft had been challenging a warrant seeking emails stored on a server in Dublin, Ireland, in a narcotics case.It was believed to be the first U.S. company to challenge a domestic search warrant seeking data held outside the country.Thursday's decision reversed a July 2014 ruling by then-Chief Judge Loretta Preska of U.S. district court in Manhattan requiring Microsoft to turn over the emails. It also voided a contempt finding against the company.""We obviously welcome today's decision,"" Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and chief legal officer, said in a statement.He said the decision gives people more confidence to rely on their own countries' laws to protect their privacy, rather than worry about foreign interference, and helps ensure that ""legal protections of the physical world apply in the digital domain.""Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, said the agency was disappointed by the decision and reviewing its legal options. ""FREE-FOR-ALL"" WAS FEARED The case has attracted strong interest from the technology and media sectors, amid concern that giving prosecutors expansive power to collect data outside the country could make it harder for U.S. companies to compete there.Dozens of companies, organizations and individuals filed briefs supporting Microsoft's appeal, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Cisco Systems Inc, CNN, Fox News Network, Gannett Co and Verizon Communications Inc.Had the court gone the other way, ""it would have been like the Wild West, with no clear, stable legal rules applying,"" Greg Nojeim, senior counsel with the nonprofit Center for Democracy & Technology in Washington, D.C., said in an interview.  Microsoft had said the warrant could not reach emails on the Dublin server because U.S. law did not apply there.The Redmond, Washington-based company also said enforcing the warrant could spark a global ""free-for-all,"" where law enforcement authorities elsewhere might seize emails belonging to Americans and stored in the United States.MODERNIZING A 30-YEAR-OLD LAW Federal prosecutors countered that quashing warrants such as Microsoft's would impede their own law enforcement efforts. But Judge Carney said limiting the reach of warrants serves ""the interest of comity"" that normally governs cross-border criminal investigations.She said that comity is also reflected in treaties between the United States and all European Union countries, including Ireland, to assist each other in such probes.Some law enforcement officials have said obtaining such assistance can, nonetheless, be cumbersome and time-consuming.The Justice Department is working on a bilateral plan to streamline how U.S. and British authorities request data from companies in each other's country.A bipartisan bill was introduced in the U.S. Senate in May to clarify when and where law enforcement may access electronic communications of U.S. citizens. Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch, who concurred in the judgment, urged Congress to modernize the ""badly outdated"" 1986 law to strike a better balance between law enforcement needs and users' privacy interests and expectations.Lynch said the law, as it stands now, lets Microsoft thwart an otherwise justified demand to turn over emails by the ""simple expedient"" of choosing to store them outside the United States.""I concur in the result, but without any illusion that the result should even be regarded as a rational policy outcome, let alone celebrated as a milestone in protecting privacy,"" he wrote.The case is In re: Warrant to Search a Certain E-Mail Account Controlled and Maintained by Microsoft Corp, 2ndU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 14-2985.",2016-07-15,MSFT,"Thu Jul 14, 2016 | 11:03pm EDT",Microsoft wins landmark appeal over seizure of foreign emails,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-microsoft-usa-warrant-idUSKCN0ZU1RJ?type=companyNews,0.9824,0.032,0.872,0.096

Microsoft launched a seven-part $19.75 billion deal, the third biggest corporate bond offering of 2016, according to IFR data. Analysts said the deal's $4.5 billion in 30-year bonds and $2.25 billion in 40-year bonds put particular pressure on 30-year Treasuries prices.U.S. 30-year Treasuries prices fell more than a full point in price, with yields hitting a session high of 2.249 percent. Yields had hit a more than two-week low of 2.177 percent on Friday. The view that yields were likely headed higher after having fallen sharply on Friday also reduced demand for U.S. Treasuries. ""The Microsoft deal is a large enough supply/demand event in the market that it is uniquely driving yields a little higher,"" said Justin Hoogendoorn, head of fixed income strategy at Piper Jaffray in Chicago.Investors also took profits after the gain in Treasuries prices and drop in yields on Friday, which analysts said was magnified by institutional month-end buying.""This is a little bit of a follow-through from late on Friday, when the prices got kind of silly because of month-end,"" said Charles Comiskey, head of Treasuries trading at Bank of Nova Scotia in New York. Comiskey also said Friday's weaker-than-expected U.S. second-quarter gross domestic product growth data had reduced the likelihood of Federal Reserve interest rate increases any time soon, rendering Treasuries prices more vulnerable to daily flows and the pricing of corporate bond deals.U.S. 30-year Treasuries prices were last down 1-15/32 to yield 2.2471 percent, from a yield of 2.182 percent late Friday.Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasuries prices were last down 14/32 to yield 1.5077 percent, after touching a more than two-week low in yield of 1.450 percent Friday.Short-dated yields rose slightly. U.S. three-year Treasuries  prices were last down 3/32 to yield 0.7795 percent, from a nearly three-week low in yield of 0.747 percent touched Friday.

Microsoft is selling a seven-tranche U.S. dollar bond Monday to finance its acquisition of LinkedIn, one of the banks managing the deal told IFR. Two market sources told IFR they expect the Microsoft bond to be U.S. $15 billion in size.       The view that yields were likely headed higher after having fallen sharply on Friday, as well as investors' favoring the imminent Microsoft bond offering over U.S. Treasuries, reduced demand for safe-haven U.S. government debt. U.S. 30-year Treasuries bore the brunt of the selling since the Microsoft offering includes several longer-dated issues, analysts said.      Orders for the offering have reached over US $30 billion, one of the banks managing the deal told IFR. U.S. 30-year Treasuries prices fell more than a full point in price, with yields hitting a session high of 2.244 percent. Yields had hit a more than two-week low of 2.177 percent on Friday.      ""The competition from the corporate sector is weighing on Treasuries,"" said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics in San Francisco.      Investors also took profits after the gain in Treasuries prices and drop in yields on Friday, which analysts said was magnified by institutional month-end buying.

U.S. three-year Treasuries  yields were last at 0.763 percent, from a nearly three-week low of 0.747 percent touched Friday.         {DATE:mon} {DATE} {DAY} {TIME:h12:mm} New York / {TIME:h24mmgmt} GMT                                Price                    {UScv1;DSPLY_NAME}            {UScv1;PRIM  {UScv1;S                                  ACT_1:F32}   EC_ACT_1                                               :F32}       {TYcv1;DSPLY_NAME}            {TYcv1;PRIM  {TYcv1;S                                  ACT_1:F256}  EC_ACT_1                                               :F256}                                    Price        Current   Net                                             Yield %   Change                                                       (bps)  Three-month bills             {US3MT=RR;P  {US3MT=R  {US3MT=                                RIMACT_1}    R;RT_YIE  RR;YLD_                                             LD_1}     NETCHG:                                                       3}  Six-month bills               {US6MT=RR;P  {US6MT=R  {US6MT=                                RIMACT_1}    R;RT_YIE  RR;YLD_                                             LD_1}     NETCHG:                                                       3}  Two-year note                 {US2YT=RR;P  {US2YT=R  {US2YT=                                RIMACT_1:F2  R;RT_YIE  RR;YLD_                                56}          LD_1}     NETCHG:                                                       3}  Three-year note               {US3YT=RR;P  {US3YT=R  {US3YT=                                RIMACT_1:F2  R;RT_YIE  RR;YLD_                                56}          LD_1}     NETCHG:                                                       3}  Five-year note                {US5YT=RR;P  {US5YT=R  {US5YT=                                RIMACT_1:F2  R;RT_YIE  RR;YLD_                                56}          LD_1}     NETCHG:                                                       3}  Seven-year note               {US7YT=RR;P  {US7YT=R  {US7YT=                                RIMACT_1:F2  R;RT_YIE  RR;YLD_                                56}          LD_1}     NETCHG:                                                       3}  10-year note                  {US10YT=RR;  {US10YT=  {US10YT                                PRIMACT_1:F  RR;RT_YI  =RR;YLD                                256}         ELD_1}    _NETCHG                                                       :3}  30-year bond                  {US30YT=RR;  {US30YT=  {US30YT                                PRIMACT_1:F  RR;RT_YI  =RR;YLD                                256}         ELD_1}    _NETCHG                                                       :3}                                                           DOLLAR SWAP SPREADS                                                                Last (bps)   Net                                                    Change                                                 (bps)       U.S. 2-year dollar swap       {USD2YTS=TW  {USD2YTS    spread                        EB;PRIMACT_  =TWEB;NE                                  1:2.6}       TCHNG_1:                                               2.6}        U.S. 3-year dollar swap       {USD3YTS=TW  {USD3YTS    spread                        EB;PRIMACT_  =TWEB;NE                                  1:2.6}       TCHNG_1:                                               2.6}        U.S. 5-year dollar swap       {USD5YTS=TW  {USD5YTS    spread                        EB;PRIMACT_  =TWEB;NE                                  1:2.6}       TCHNG_1:                                               2.6}        U.S. 10-year dollar swap      {USD10YTS=T  {USD10YT    spread                        WEB;PRIMACT  S=TWEB;N                                  _1:2.6}      ETCHNG_1                                               :2.6}       U.S. 30-year dollar swap      {USD30YTS=T  {USD30YT    spread                        WEB;PRIMACT  S=TWEB;N                                  _1:2.6}      ETCHNG_1                                               :2.6}         (Reporting by Sam Forgione; Editing by Andrea Ricci)   ",2016-08-01,MSFT,"Mon Aug 1, 2016 | 11:41am EDT","TREASURIES-Yields rise on Microsoft bond offering, profit-taking",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-bonds-idUSL1N1AI0OI?type=companyNews,0.8697,0.048,0.884,0.068

1105,"   By Jessica Toonkel  Sony Interactive Entertainment, a division of Sony Corp (6758.T), unveiled on Wednesday two new versions of its PlayStation 4 Console in an effort to help Sony maintain its sales lead over Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Nintendo Co Ltd (7974.T).The PlayStation 4 Pro, which will launch Nov. 10, will support higher resolution and more realistic imagery by enabling  4k resolution and higher dynamic range (HDR), said Andrew House, chief executive of Sony Interactive Entertainment, at a PlayStation event in New York City Tuesday announcing the new products. The console will cost $399.Additionally, the company unveiled a slimmer, lighter and more energy efficient version of its PlayStation 4 Console, which will come out Sept. 15 and will cost $299. PlayStation Pro, whose code name is ""Neo,"" will support Sony's virtual reality headset, due to launch in October.  The PlayStation VR headset will go on sale in the United States on Oct. 13 with 50 titles available by the end of the year, the company has said.Additionally, Sony will make an upgrade available that will enable all 40 million users of its PlayStation 4 console to upgrade to HDR, House said.Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) will launch a new app when the console launches with 600 hours of 4k content, including its hit crime series ""Narcos,"" House said. Google's YouTube unit is also planning an app for PS 4 Pro, he said. Since the 2013 launch, Sony has sold more than 40 million units of the PlayStation 4 console, far outpacing Microsoft Corp's XBox One and Nintendo's Wii U.Sony has said the games business is set to be its biggest growth driver, helped by strong PS4 console sales, a rise in subscribers to its PlayStation network and the launch of its virtual reality headset. In the financial year through March 2017, Sony expects the gaming unit to account for 45 percent of its overall operating profit.Sony forecasts PS4 sales at 20 million units for this financial year, up from the previous year's 17.7 million units.

China has frequently been at odds with the WTO, especially with the United States, and the trade relations between the world's two largest economies have become strained, with accusations of protectionism not uncommon.Technology has been a particular sore spot for foreign firms operating in China, with Microsoft Corp being investigated for anti-trust violations. Beijing has already found chip-maker Qualcomm Inc guilty of anti-trust violations.   Some of the products on the list are of great importance to Beijing, including semiconductors. In some years, China has spent more on importing semiconductors, often for use in smartphone manufacturing and similar industries, than it has on crude oil.Other items to have duties cut include touch screens, audio-visual equipment and medical devices, as well as various specialized product parts. A small number of products will have their tariffs reduced to zero within seven years, the statement said.  The cuts also fit a pattern of government moves to reduce taxes across various sectors, in an effort to boost consumption.

The two multinationals said at the Sibos financial services conference in Geneva that they would build and test the technology and create a blockchain-based framework that could eventually be sold to other businesses.Blockchain works as an electronic record-keeping and transaction-processing system that allows all parties to track information through a secure network and requires no third-party verification.  Proponents of the technology, which originates from digital currency bitcoin, say that it will make all kinds of transactions faster, more reliable and easier to audit because it does not require manual processing, nor authentication through intermediaries.Trade transactions using the existing process typically take between seven and 10 days to complete and involve a complicated paper trail that is vulnerable to document fraud.

1117,"   By Julia Love  Alphabet Inc's Google said on Thursday it renamed its business-to-business cloud computing brand and enhanced some enterprise applications using artificial intelligence, the company's latest gambit to better compete with Amazon.com and Microsoft Corp. in the lucrative cloud business.  Discussing the rebranded Google Cloud, Diane Greene, senior vice president of Google's enterprise business, said the company has made good progress courting customers and improving its technology. Cloud computing uses remote internet servers to store, manage and process data, and Google offers a range of apps like word processing and email, as well as the ability to host data and offer resources for developers. The new name replaces the Google for Work brand. ""We are closing the gap incredibly fast"" with competitors, Greene, a former CEO of VMware who joined Google last year to ramp up its cloud business, told experts and journalists at an event.  Analysts say Google trails Amazon and Microsoft in market share but is gaining under Greene. Although the business is not big enough to break out separately in its quarterly earnings statement, Google reported a 33 percent surge in ""other revenue"" in its most recent quarter, which analysts said was probably due largely to gains in cloud computing.  Greene has moved quickly to streamline engineering and appointed new leadership to beef up the company's cloud business. This has helped improve sales, Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai said during the company's latest earnings call.Earlier this month, Google acquired cloud software company Apigee Corp in a deal valued at about $625 million. The company on Thursday also announced a partnership with consultant Accenture to develop cloud services for clients in industries such a retail, healthcare and finance.In addition, the company said it had woven more artificial intelligence into its apps to help employees work more efficiently. Using machine learning to crunch troves of data, Google says its apps will prompt users to, say, open files at certain times of day or propose meetings based on their habits. Google recently added a U.S. data center in Oregon in order to speed up service and next year will open more in Virginia, Mumbai, Singapore, Sydney, São Paulo, London, Finland and Frankfurt.

1131,"  * Elliott has proposed restructuring of company* Has also proposed $27 billion special dividend* Shares climb as much as 5 pct to record high   (Recasts with Samsung comment and share price reaction)By Se Young Lee and Michael FlahertySEOUL/NEW YORK, Oct 6 Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Thursday it will carefully review proposals made by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management for restructuring and a special dividend, pushing the firm's shares to a record high.The activist investor sent a letter to the world's No. 1 smartphone maker on Wednesday, spelling out changes that include splitting into a holding company and listing its operating company on the Nasdaq stock exchange.Samsung said in a statement that it would carefully consider the proposals, adding the firm ""believes in a constructive and open dialogue with investors with a view to maximising shareholder value.""Samsung shares jumped as much as 5 percent to mark a new high in morning trade, outperforming a 0.6 rise for the broader market.Elliott's latest activist target is in the middle of a leadership succession and is under pressure after issuing an unprecedented recall of at least 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones last month.Samsung's willingness to consider Elliott's proposals helped the stock shrug off renewed concerns about the recall after owners of a replacement Note 7 said its battery had begun smoking in U.S. plane.This has prompted fresh investigations by the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Federal Aviation Administration. Samsung said it was working to recover the device and that it cannot confirm whether the device in question is a replacement Note 7 until it can retrieve it. LATEST TARGET Elliott, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, owns 0.62 percent of Samsung's shares. The $27 billion hedge fund also called into question Samsung's corporate governance and said the family-run company should add three new independent directors to its board.Elliott said the new holding company should look at a possible all-stock merger with Samsung C&T Corp - a subsidiary that the New York hedge fund targeted in a heated shareholder battle last year. Elliott ultimately failed to derail Samsung C&T's merger with sister firm Cheil Industries Inc.Samsung C&T declined to comment on Elliott's merger proposal. U.S. hedge funds rarely target foreign companies for activist campaigns. Other than Third Point, a hedge fund active in Japan, Elliott is the only major U.S. activist with a significant presence in Asia.With such a small stake and an already adversarial relationship, Elliott faces an uphill climb in convincing other shareholders and Samsung's leadership team to implement its changes.One factor that could help Elliott in its efforts is Samsung Electronic's more international shareholder base.Unlike the Samsung C&T battle, where the majority of shareholders were domestic investors, 11 of Samsung Electronic's top 20 shareholders are international investors, according to Thomson Reuters data.U.S. activist ValueAct Capital was given a board seat at Microsoft Corp. in 2013, while holding only 0.8 percent of the company's stock. According to a person familiar with the matter, Elliott is seeking to speak with Samsung's leaders and board, and work with the company collaboratively to implement its proposed changes. Samsung did not immediately comment on whether it has been in communications with Elliott.SUCCESSION Elliott's proposals come as Samsung Group has undertaken a series of moves to pave the way for a stable handover from the ailing, 74-year-old Lee Kun-hee to his three children.Lee's son, Jay Y. Lee, 48, is seen as the de facto leader of Samsung Group as his father remains incapacitated following a 2014 heart attack. The younger Lee was nominated as a board director of Samsung Electronics last month - a role that analyst says will allow him to take a more public role in major strategic decisions.Speculation on how Samsung could restructure its business has loomed for at least a year, with analysts offering up a variety of options, including the so called ""opco/holdco"" division that Elliott proposed on Wednesday.Elliott nodded to Samsung's recent stock buyback, but said its ""substantial and excess net cash position comes at a very real and tangible cost to shareholders.""Elliott said it wants Samsung to pay a 30 trillion won ($27 billion) special dividend from its $70 billion cash pile.($1 = 1,111.1600 won)(Additional reporting by Rishika Sadam; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Edwina Gibbs)",2016-10-06,MSFT,"Wed Oct 5, 2016 | 9:20pm EDT","UPDATE 4-Samsung Elec to carefully review Elliott proposals, shares hit record high",http://www.reuters.com//article/samsung-elec-elliottmanagement-idUSL3N1CC055?type=companyNews,0.9477,0.028,0.909,0.063

1140,"   By Olivia Oran and Sweta Singh  Morgan Stanley reported a better-than-expected profit on Wednesday, boosted by a surge in bond trading that helped all Wall Street banks last quarter.Morgan Stanley's gains were especially notable. Its adjusted bond-trading revenue more than doubled, hitting Chief Executive James Gorman's revenue target for that business for the second quarter in a row.The bank had struggled for years to improve in bond trading, which has volatile revenue and tough capital requirements to meet. Earlier this year, Morgan Stanley restructured the unit, cutting 25 percent of staff and appointing new leadership.In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said the bank was on the right track, though it might be too soon to claim victory.""The success we've had in the last quarter or two has boosted morale and confidence of the team,"" he said. ""But these things take time and until we can do it for years as opposed to quarters, we're not going to declare success.""Though it is still early in the fourth quarter, Pruzan said the trading environment has so far been similar to the end of September.Overall, Morgan Stanley's earnings applicable to common shareholders rose 62 percent to $1.5 billion, from $939 million in the same quarter a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 81 cents from 48 cents, helped by stock buybacks.Analysts had estimated earnings of 63 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 15 percent to $8.9 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $8.2 billion. Non-interest expenses rose just 4 percent, reflecting a cost-cutting program that Morgan Stanley hopes will shave $1 billion from annual expenses by next year. That program, called Project Streamline, is on track despite costs associated with the bank's stress test resubmission as well as Brexit, Pruzan said. Morgan Stanley's shares rose 0.8 percent to $32.57 at midday.STRONG QUARTER    Morgan Stanley wrapped up a surprisingly strong quarter for big U.S. banks. Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley's closest rival, reported a better-than-expected 58 percent rise in third-quarter profit on Tuesday.Bond trading was strong across Wall Street, driven by Britain's surprise vote to leave the European Union and bouts of anxiety about monetary policy around the world. Morgan Stanley's bond-trading revenue rose to $1.5 billion in the third quarter from $583 million in the year-ago period, when stripping out accounting gains and losses related to the value of its own bonds. ""We obviously did much better than probably anybody felt this quarter ...,"" Gorman said during a call with analysts. ""... But we did not and are not going to run any victory lap around fixed income.""Despite that rebound, Morgan Stanley posted an 8.7 percent return on equity, which is less than Gorman's stated target of 9 percent to 11 percent by the end of 2017.Pruzan said he continued to believe that the bank's target ROE was achievable.  Equities sales and trading revenue, a traditional bright spot for the bank, edged up just 1 percent to $1.9 billion.Revenue from investment banking fell about 7 percent to $1.23 billion, due to weaker M&A fees and capital markets activity. Morgan Stanley ranked third to Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co in M&A fees collected during the quarter and fourth behind JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp and Goldman in fees from investment banking, which includes equity and debt underwriting, according to Thomson Reuters data.Revenue from wealth management, which Morgan Stanley has been building for several years, rose 7 percent to $3.9 billion. The business hit a 23 percent pretax margin, in line with Gorman's target for year-end.Gorman said to expect an announcement from the firm's wealth management executives in the coming weeks regarding how the bank will comply with the Department of Labor fiduciary rule. The rule, announced in April, sets a standard for brokers who sell retirement products and requires them to put clients' best interests ahead of their own bottom line.  Gorman hinted that providing choice to clients about different investing products remains a priority for the firm.

Microsoft said it would increase prices for its enterprise software by 13 percent and for its cloud services by 22 percent from Jan. 1 next year, becoming the latest tech company to raise fees in the wake of the vote to leave the European Union.

The issue hit the headlines this month when Britain's biggest supermarket, Tesco (TSCO.L), clashed with supplier Unilever (ULVR.L), briefly pulling popular goods such as the spread Marmite from its website.    Nestle (NESN.S), the Swiss maker of Kit Kat bars and Nescafe coffee, has said it is also looking at all options to deal with the steep decline in the British currency.Long known for its Windows software, Microsoft has turned its focus to mobile and cloud computing in recent years, storing, managing and processing data for thousands of companies and public sector providers across a range of sectors.

1158,"  YOKOHAMA Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) and Renault SA (RENA.PA) are open to partnerships with other companies to equip their vehicles with sophisticated technology as automakers race to develop the cars of the future, the pair's connected vehicles chief said.Global automakers are competing with industry rivals and technology firms to develop self-driving cars and mobility services such as car sharing as the growing use of technology and artificial intelligence may eventually diminish the role of drivers, threatening the traditional model of car ownership.As software used in cars becomes more sophisticated and costly, there will be benefits of partnerships - including with rivals - to develop standardized technology such as mapping services, said Ogi Redzic, who heads the Nissan-Renault alliances' Connected Vehicles and Mobility Services division.""We are in the spirit of collaboration,"" Redzic, who joined the alliance earlier this year after working for companies including Nokia and Motorola, told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.""There are some other companies which would like to build everything in-house, but ... we are willing to partner when it makes sense.""Nissan and Renault are developing a technology platform that will enable alliance vehicles, including those made by newest member Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T), to access cloud-based services including infotainment, car maintenance and remote control operation. The automakers have been increasing investment in that area, announcing a partnership last month with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to develop connected car functions powered by Microsoft's Azure cloud storage service. The pair have also acquired French software developer Sylpheo.Automakers have been scrambling to partner with tech firms to mitigate the risk that self-driving cars and car sharing will trim demand for car ownership decades down the line. This year has seen a handful of automakers partnering car sharing service providers, including General Motors Co (GM.N) and Lyft Inc, Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) and Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL], and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and Israel's Gett.Redzic declined to comment on the alliance's strategy for car sharing. Renault has a partnership with Bollore, under which it produces electric vehicles for the French car-sharing service and supplies ultra-compact cars.Renault also supplies its ultra-compact Twizy to rental companies. Redzic said the alliance was open to offering more vehicles to car service providers, noting that fleet sales were ""a very healthy part of our business"". ""I don't know if we would say 'No' to someone who wants to operate a service using a subset of our vehicles,"" he said.""The question is whether we are going to operate a service on our own or if we're going to work with a partner,"" he said.

1159,"   By Julia Love  Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) Chief Executive Officer Marc Benioff spoke on Wednesday about a pair of key acquisitions that got away, suggesting his vision for LinkedIn Corp LNKD.N was different from Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) and that he would have pursued Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) if shareholders had not learned of his plans.Speaking at a technology conference hosted by the Wall Street Journal in Laguna Beach, California, Benioff declined to elaborate on what he had hoped to do with micro-blogging site Twitter. Twitter hired bankers earlier in October to explore selling itself. Technology and media companies including Salesforce.com, Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google looked at the company but passed on buying it.Some regarded Twitter as an unlikely fit for Salesforce.com, whose platform is popular among sales teams. Benioff said he was forced to drop the deal when investors began voicing concerns.  “We’ve never had a deal leak before; we don’t really understand that dynamic,” said Benioff, who is an avid Twitter user. “We had to stop because I’m running the business in partnership with my shareholders.”  Benioff was also effusive about his interest in professional social networking site LinkedIn, which Microsoft agreed to buy for $26.2 billion in June. Benioff told technology news website Recode in June that Salesforce.com made a bid for LinkedIn and was primarily interested in its recruiting business.Benioff on Wednesday said he saw parallels between Salesforce.com’s business model and LinkedIn’s.“We really liked some of the business fundamentals,” he said, adding few details on his vision for an acquisition of LinkedIn. He contrasted that vision with Microsoft’s, which he said centered on mingling the companies' data streams to make it difficult for other companies to compete. Salesforce.com has raised concerns about the deal to European antitrust regulators.“Last time I checked, that was illegal,” he said of Microsoft's plans for LinkedIn's data.  Microsoft said it was confident it would gain final regulatory approval for the LinkedIn acquisition by the end of 2016.""We’re committed to continuing to work to bring price competition to a CRM (customer relationship management) market in which Salesforce is the dominant participant charging customers higher prices,” a Microsoft spokesman said in an emailed statement.

Samsung plans to integrate the San Jose-based company's AI platform, called Viv, into the Galaxy smartphones and expand voice-assistant services to home appliances and wearable technology devices.Samsung is counting on the Galaxy S8 to help revive smartphone momentum after scrapping the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7, which will hit its profit by $5.4 billion over three quarters through the first quarter of 2017.

1184,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Microsoft (MSFT.O) is set to gain EU approval for its $26 billion buy of professional social network LinkedIn LNKD.N with tweaks to concessions aimed at addressing competition concerns, three people close to the matter said on Wednesday.Microsoft last week told the European Commission that it would still allow LinkedIn's rivals access to its software such as its Outlook program and give hardware makers the option of installing competing professional social networks on computers after the acquisition.The second plank of the concession is important because of the company's battle with the EU competition authority over the last decade and the policy of tying its products to block rivals, resulting in fines of more than 2.2 billion euros.The slight modifications came following feedback from rivals and customers, the people said, declining to provide details because of the sensitivity of the issue. The deal, Microsoft's largest ever acquisition, will allow the company to add a suite of sales, marketing and recruiting services to its core business products as it gears up for next-generation computing. However, it came amidst regulatory concerns and citizens' worries about big data and that some companies may use the huge amount of information they gather to squeeze out competitors and encroach on users' privacy. The deal has been criticized by U.S. rival Salesforce (CRM.N), which lost out on the bidding for LinkedIn and which urged regulators to examine the antitrust and data privacy issues thoroughly before approving it.The Commission, which is scheduled to decide on the deal by Dec. 6, as well as Microsoft, declined to comment.  Authorities in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa have already nodded through the acquisition without demanding concessions.The bulk of LinkedIn's $3 billion annual revenue comes from job hunters and recruiters who pay a monthly fee to post resumes and connect with people.

1186,"   By Julia Fioretti | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS Web giants YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft will step up efforts to remove extremist content from their websites by creating a common database.The companies will share 'hashes' - unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos - of extremist content they have removed from their websites to enable their peers to identify the same content on their platforms.   ""We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,"" the companies said in a statement on Tuesday.Tech companies have long resisted outside intervention in how their sites should be policed, but have come under increasing pressure from Western governments to do more to remove extremist content following a wave of militant attacks.YouTube and Facebook have begun to use hashes to automatically remove extremist content. But many providers have relied until now mainly on users to flag content that violates terms of service. Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation.Twitter suspended 235,000 accounts between February and August this year and has expanded the teams reviewing reports of extremist content. Each company will decide what image and video hashes to add to the database and matching content will not be automatically removed, they said.The database will be up and running in early 2017 and more companies could be brought into the partnership.The European Union set up an EU Internet Forum last year bringing together the internet companies, interior ministers and the EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator to find ways of removing extremist content. The Forum will meet again on Thursday, when ministers are expected to ask the companies about their efforts and helping to provide evidence to convict foreign fighters.

Reuters had flagged the imminent EU approval on Nov. 23.To secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in program, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programs.It will also allow computer makers the option of installing or removing LinkedIn on its Windows operating system, and give competing networks access to Microsoft Graph for software developers. The concessions will be in force in Europe for five years. U.S. software company Salesforce, which lost out on the bid for LinkedIn and had urged regulators to take a tough line on the deal, said enforcers should not drop their guard.""Given Microsoft's history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it,"" Salesforce said in a statement.

Analysts said the ruling was a step towards alleviating the light oil glut on the U.S. Gulf Coast and it would potentially weigh on refining margins.U.S. refiners may see crude costs go up as they would have to compete with international buyers for supplies, analysts said. Most refiners, except Phillips 66, have campaigned against a lifting of the U.S. ban on exports.The ruling sent down shares of refiners most levered to light crude oil. Shares of Alon USA Energy Inc, Delek US Holdings Inc  and HollyFrontier Corp were all down about 7 percent, while those of Western Refining Inc were 6 percent lower. Valero shares were down about 9 percent.The U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security told Pioneer Natural that lightly processed condensate would be eligible for export without a license.The department had given approval via a private ruling to Pioneer Natural and Enterprise Products to export the condensate, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.Pioneer Natural's shares rose as much as 4 percent, while Enterprise Products' stock gained 1.6 percent.

The Eagle Ford Basin asset is a three-way joint venture between Mumbai, India-based Reliance; Irving, Texas-based Pioneer, and a division of Mexico's Alpha SAB de CV (ALFAA.MX). Reliance has appointed Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) to help sell its 45 percent stake, the sources said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.Representatives for Citi and Bank of America declined to comment, while Reliance could not be immediately reached for comment. The property for sale produces 115,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with 60 percent of the production in liquid form rather than gas, one of the people said. There are 472 wells on the Eagle Ford property, according to a Reliance presentation from July. Pioneer owns 46 percent of the joint venture, with Alpha SAB's Newpeck LLC owning 9 percent. As part of its planned exit from the Eagle Ford joint venture, Reliance is also selling its investment in EFS Midstream LLC, an oil and gas gathering treatment and transportation network, the people said. The mid-stream joint venture was initially funded by Pioneer and Reliance in June 2010.EFS Midstream operates 11 central gathering plants in south Texas, according to the company's website. The sale process for the oil production assets and the oil and gas gathering assets is at an early stage, the people said.Pioneer is the operator of the wells in the joint venture, which could complicate the sale process, one of the people said.

1205,"   By Lucas Iberico Lozada | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 6 Pioneer Natural Resources , a major producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas, said on Tuesday it has restructured most of its 2015 hedge position to protect against further falls in oil prices.The move reflects a growing belief in the industry that prices will not return to pre-crash levels this year, and is one of the more effective tools in U.S. producers' arsenal in their stare-down with OPEC over market share.Pioneer's decision follows a Monday announcement by smaller rival Concho Resources that it would be dramatically scaling back its 2015 spending plan. Pioneer said in a statement that it had replaced most of its options-based ""three-way collars"" with fixed-price swaps. This exchanges a system with more potential upside for one that offers greater protection on the way down, after it was left exposed in November.Collars guarantee producers sales within a given range, provided the market price for a barrel of oil does not fall beneath a put option, set lower than the ""floor"" of the range. Swaps guarantee future sales at a fixed price but limit potential gains on the upside. For its third quarter, Pioneer reported a robust hedge book, with collars in place for some 96,000 barrels per day (bpd), about 85 percent of what the company says it expects to produce in 2015. But those collars were set with the lower put option - which analysts call a ""subfloor"" - at $73.54 a barrel, leaving the company unprotected when prices dropped below $70 in late November. By replacing the inert collars with swaps set at just above $71 per barrel for 82,000 barrels per day and leaving its 2016 collars in place, the company is effectively betting that prices will stay low throughout the year and rise again in early 2016.The company did not respond to a request for comment on which lender was used for the transaction, and how much it had been charged.(Reporting by Lucas Iberico Lozada; Editing by Richard Chang)",2015-01-07,PXD,"Tue Jan 6, 2015 | 7:10pm EST",U.S. shale producer Pioneer restructures 2015 hedges,http://www.reuters.com//article/oil-hedging-pioneer-natl-rsc-idUSL1N0UL28D20150107?type=companyNews,0.815,0.034,0.901,0.065
1206,"  (Adds quotes, details)By Jessica Resnick-Ault and Anna DriverHOUSTON, April 21 Pioneer Natural Resources Co , a top oil producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas, will start adding drilling rigs in June so long as market conditions are favorable, the company's CEO said on Tuesday in a bold show of industry optimism.The comments from Scott Sheffield mark the first time during the current crude price downturn that a prominent shale oil company has said rigs will be added soon. Many companies have slashed their rig fleets in half after crude prices fell 50 percent after June. But prices have ticked upward some 13 percent this month to around $55 per barrel.Sheffield said the market bottomed out some weeks ago at $42 a barrel. What remains now is to see if inventories fall. ""We're going to see what happens when Cushing gets full,"" he said, referring to the U.S. crude oil storage hub. The massive oil storage facility is currently 8 million barrels from its maximum capacity, he said.Sheffield said if market conditions are right, Pioneer will add about two rigs a month. Pioneer expects to add rigs as additional takeaway capacity in the Permian basin comes online, Sheffield said. He expects the Permian Express pipeline to come into service by July 1.Pioneer has hedged 90 percent of its 2015 production and 60 percent of its 2016 production. The company has not yet begun to hedge its 2017 production. While ""prices aren't bad"" for 2017, according to Sheffield, he is reluctant to enter into a contract that wouldn't allow for upside in the case of geopolitical disruptions that tighten supply.Pioneer aims to send about 70 percent of its crude to the Gulf Coast, and the remainder to Cushing by July 1, Sheffield said.

1207,"   By Jessica Resnick-Ault and Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Pioneer Natural Resources Co may be the first major U.S. shale oil producer to ramp up drilling after a deep slump halved prices, adding rigs as soon as June so long as market conditions are favorable.In an unusually bold show of industry optimism, Chief Executive Officer Scott Sheffield told Reuters on Tuesday that Pioneer, a top producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas, may increase drilling at a rate of two rigs a month, starting to reverse a trend that has seen the U.S. oil rig rate halve in seven months.The comments mark the first time during the current crude price downturn that a prominent shale oil company has spoken publicly about new drilling, even as other executives work to curb spending and cut costs to ride out the downturn.""We hope to be adding rigs,"" Sheffield said in an interview.It may signal the start of a shift in industry thinking after months of tumbling prices, as big traders like Vitol and consultants including PIRA Energy call an end to the slump. Sheffield too believes that prices bottomed out some weeks ago at $42 a barrel, but wants to see if record stockpiles ebb.Oil prices dived by more than 60 percent since last summer, but have rebounded by as much as $15 a barrel this month.""We're going to see what happens when Cushing gets full,"" he said, referring to the U.S. crude oil storage hub. The massive oil storage facility is currently 8 million barrels from its maximum capacity, he said. If other drillers follow suit, the decline in U.S. oil production that is expected to begin as early as next month may be short-lived. However Pioneer’s extensive oil price hedges may also give it greater confidence to drill more than some of its peers who are less protected from another price slump. Sheffield said if market conditions are right, Pioneer will add about two rigs a month. Pioneer expects to add rigs as additional takeaway capacity in the Permian basin comes online, Sheffield said. He expects the Permian Express pipeline to come into service by July 1.     HEAVILY HEDGED Other CEOs, like Continental Resources Inc's Harold Hamm, counter that ramping up drilling may come more slowly, noting that the process requires permitting and other measures that may cause it to be much slower than shutting in production. While Continental shed its hedges, Pioneer is well protected. Pioneer has hedged 90 percent of its 2015 production and 60 percent of its 2016 production. The company has not yet begun to hedge its 2017 production.While ""prices aren't bad"" for 2017, according to Sheffield, he is reluctant to enter into a contract that would not allow for upside in the case of geopolitical disruptions that tighten supply.  Pioneer aims to send about 70 percent of its crude to the Gulf Coast, and the remainder to Cushing by July 1, Sheffield said.Pioneer is continuing to export superlight crude oil known as condensate to Asia at a rate of about 20,000 barrels a day, gross, Sheffield said. ""It helps when there's a spread of $7 to $9 with Brent,"" he said.U.S. policy bans nearly all crude exports, but allows shipments of minimally processed super light oil known as condensate.The U.S. Energy Information Administration has forecast American oil output may dip as early as this month and certainly later this year, before rising to around 9.18 million barrels per day at year's end.

Some on Wall Street remained optimistic about the company and sector despite Einhorn's criticisms. For these investors and advisers, the fate of the companies depends primarily upon oil prices. ""He is right if oil prices remain under $60; he is dead wrong if prices go beyond $75,” said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co.

Investors have piled in to Pioneer and other shale drillers, driving up their shares up as much as 30 percent since January, outstripping gains in oil.

1212,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss, Jessica Toonkel and Ashley Lau | NEW YORK  NEW YORK May 4 Billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn kicked off the 20th annual Sohn Investment Conference in New York on Monday by laying out his case against oil frackers, arguing that these companies drill ""lots and lots of holes"" and burn through plenty of cash.Einhorn, who often unveils so-called short-bets against companies at these events, cited Pioneer Natural Resources Co  as a particular offender, and its stock price dropped as much as 5.3 percent. The company should trade closer to $78 a share, he said, not the $166.50 the stock is trading at now.""Pioneer is burning cash and its reserves are not growing,"" said Einhorn, who runs $11 billion Greenlight Capital, adding ""Pioneer ought to stop touting estimates based on stale pricing."" The company is losing 20 cents of present value for every dollar it invests. Last year Einhorn unveiled a short bet against athenahealth Inc at a previous Sohn conference and was the first to underscore problems at Lehman Brothers months before the investment bank filed for bankruptcy.Activist investor Barry Rosenstein discussed two investment ideas that were already well known on Wall Street: His bets on drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc and  Qualcomm Inc. Keith Meister, a former Carl Icahn lieutenant who now runs $8 billion Corvex Management, touted fast food restaurant chain Yum Brands, saying his firm is one of the five largest investors and that the company is Corvex's second-biggest investment ever. On Friday Daniel Loeb's Third Point said it had taken a ""significant"" stake in Yum. Meister said Yum should spin off its China business, allowing a fully independent China company that appeals to the nation's large middle class. He said Yum's share could trade at least at $130, compared with the current price of $92.25, after the company spins off the China operation.For visitors to the Sohn Conference, a virtual who's who of the $3 trillion hedge fund industry held at New York's Avery Fisher Hall, the draw is getting new ideas to put into a portfolio at a time stock-picking is getting ever tougher after a multi-year bull market.Hedge fund manager Whitney Tilson said he has not adjusted his portfolio in months and is looking for inspiration for fresh positions.

1213,"  May 4 Greenlight Capital's David Einhorn said on Monday that oil company Pioneer Natural Resources was ""dramatically overvalued"", and fell into a category of firms involved in hydraulic fracturing that are now losing money.Pioneer was down 2.7 percent at $1.6679 a share, after his comments.  ""We object to oil fracking because their investments can contaminate portfolio returns,"" Einhorn told the Sohn Investment Conference in New York.

1215,"   By Svea Herbst-Bayliss, Jessica Toonkel and Ashley Lau | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Billionaire hedge fund manager David Einhorn, who often moves a stock simply by speaking its name, on Monday kicked off the year's most prominent investment conference by laying out a case against oil frackers, arguing these companies drill ""lots and lots of holes"" and burn through plenty of cash.Einhorn, who often unveils short-bets against companies at these events, cited Pioneer Natural Resources Co as a particular offender at the 20th annual Sohn Investment Conference. ""We call it the motherfracker,"" he said, prompting investors to kick the share price down as much as 5.3 percent. The company should trade closer to $78 a share, he said, not the $166.50 the stock is trading at now.""Pioneer is burning cash and its reserves are not growing,"" said Einhorn, who runs $11 billion Greenlight Capital, adding ""Pioneer ought to stop touting estimates based on stale pricing."" The company is losing 20 cents of present value for every dollar it invests.Pioneer shares closed Monday at $168.33 a share, down 1.88 percent.Einhorn also mentioned EOG Resources Inc, which he called the “father fracker,” Concho Resources, Whiting Petroleum Corp and Continental Resources Inc.Last year Einhorn unveiled a short bet against athenahealth Inc at a previous Sohn conference and was the first to underscore problems at Lehman Brothers months before the investment bank filed for bankruptcy.Einhorn was one of the few investors at the conference who unveiled a short bet, as most other investors put forth ideas that investors can buy and hold. Leon Cooperman and David Tepper talked about markets and sought to soothe investors fearful that the long-running  equities bull market might be over.Tepper, founder of Appaloosa Management, shocked markets a year ago by warning that investors should not be too long in the stock market. On Monday, he said that investors should not be ""too long bonds, not too short stocks"" and warned that investors should be careful with commodity investments.Investors at this conference, even the billionaires, are told to keep it short and talk no more than 15 minutes. Tepper who didn't use all of his time joked that he would sell some of his unused minutes to Bill Ackman, who is known for speaking at a breakneck pace to race through dozens and dozen of slides. Cooperman, who runs Omega Advisors and has long been saying the stock market would continue to climb, stuck by his bullish outlook, saying the stock market can still end higher this year. ""If there is a bubble out there, it is not in the stock market,"" Cooperman said, adding it may be in the fixed income market.He pitched a handful of U.S.-based companies including Google Inc, Dow Chemical Co, Priceline Group Inc and drugmaker Actavis Plc.Picking up on the pharmaceutical industry theme, Larry Robbins, who runs Glenview Capital Management, touted AbbVie Inc, saying the stock price could double. The company's price is relatively cheap and management is disciplined, Robbins said. Even though AbbVie called off a planned $55 billion takeover of Shire late last year, industry analysts are still holding out forecasts that the breakneck pace of mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry will continue. The company could be taken over or it could be the one taking over someone else, Robbins said. Ackman, founder and chief executive of Pershing Square Capital Management LP, talked about his most recent addition to the portfolio: Canadian pharmaceutical company Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc, which he called ""massively undervalued."" He said companies that buy up others at a steady pace are often misunderstood and said Valeant, which announced plans to buy Salix earlier this year, is an early stage Berkshire Hathaway, referring to Warren Buffett's company.Keith Meister, a former Carl Icahn lieutenant who now runs $8 billion Corvex Management, focused on fast food restaurant chain Yum Brands, saying his firm is one of the five largest investors and that the company is Corvex's second-biggest investment ever.

EFS Midstream, formed by Pioneer Natural and Reliance in June 2010, includes about 460 miles of natural gas pipelines, 10 central plants and 780 million cubic feet per day of natural gas treating capacity. Enterprise Products will pay the first installment of $1.15 billion at closing and the rest no later than the first anniversary of the closing date. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter.

1219,"  (Adds details on WPX plan, background)July 8 U.S. shale exploration and production company Pioneer Natural Resources Co said on Wednesday it is increasing drilling activity in Texas following the sale of its stake in an Eagle Ford shale pipeline and processing business.The Dallas company's optimism stands out in a market unnerved by a 15 percent drop in crude prices since late June. Pioneer Chief Executive Scott Sheffield told Reuters in April that his company would start adding rigs this month if market conditions warranted more drilling.""Our strong balance sheet, combined with a strong derivatives position for 2015 and 2016, provides us with the financial firepower to ramp up drilling activity,"" Sheffield said in a statement.North Dakota oil producer WPX Energy Inc said last month it would add two drilling rigs later this year, a decision that is unchanged despite the recent crude oil price drop. Half a dozen or so other companies in the crowded U.S. shale industry have indicated they may add rigs but have so far not made definite moves as they wait to see where crude prices settle.Pioneer said it has already added two drilling rigs in the Permian Basin this month and plans to add an average of two per month during the balance of the year as long as the crude oil price ""remains constructive,"" the company said. The increased drilling is not expected to have a big impact on 2015 production, which had been forecast to grow more than 10 percent, but it will push capital spending up $350 million to $2.2 billion, the company said.More rigs are planned for early next year. Pioneer said it plans to add eight horizontal rigs in Texas shale basins, bringing the total rig count to 36, or the same number it had before the price of oil collapsed by more than half. Pioneer, which owned 50.1 percent of the Eagle Ford pipeline and processing business before the sale, said its share of the proceeds from Enterprise Product Partners LP is $530 million at closing and about $500 million a year after closing.(Reporting by Anna Driver in Houston and Ernest Scheyder in Williston, North Dakota; Editing by Richard Chang)",2015-07-08,PXD,"Wed Jul 8, 2015 | 1:43pm EDT",UPDATE 1-Pioneer says increasing drilling activity as planned,http://www.reuters.com//article/pioneer-natl-rsc-rigs-idUSL1N0ZO1ID20150708?type=companyNews,-0.8419,0.065,0.886,0.049

1221,"  (Repeating for additional clients without changes to text)By Anna DriverHOUSTON Aug 21 Top shale oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co has found an unusual way to both save water and cut costs for its wells: tapping the treated runoff from toilets, sinks and showers in West Texas.Pioneer has signed an 11-year, $117 million deal with the city of Odessa, Texas that will guarantee it access to millions of gallons of treated municipal wastewater each day, for use in nearby oilfields. Deliveries of the so-called effluent, are expected to start at the end of the year.As crude oil has slid to its lowest level in six years -currently about $40 a barrel - oil and gas companies pumping from shale rock have tried to cut every unnecessary penny from their operations. Water acquisition and transportation can be up to 10 percent of the cost of drilling and fracking a well, according to consulting firm IHS.Producers are also trying to mitigate long-term risks of water scarcity in the arid Permian Basin of West Texas, where the top U.S. oilfield is situated.Oil and gas companies operating in area, including Pioneer and Apache Corp, have long sought cheaper, more environmentally sound sources of water to use for fracking. For example, both companies have drawn some of the water they use in their operations from the Permian's brackish aquifers, which contain water unfit for drinking. Both companies also have worked to recycle water that is used for frack jobs or found in the ground while drilling.During hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, million of gallons of water are blasted, along with sand and chemicals, into a well drilled through shale or other rocks. The high-pressure slurry cracks the rock, allowing oil and gas to escape and exit the well.Pioneer is the first oil and gas company to sign a long-term wastewater supply contract with Odessa, a city of about 110,000 people. The Dallas-based company recently began construction on a pipeline network that will transport the treated water from the city's sewage plant to one of its oilfields about 20 miles away. ""The money has been approved,"" said Stephen McNair, president of Pioneer's water management group.Pioneer's goal is to eliminate the use of fresh water in fracking in 5 to 10 years, said McNair.The municipal reclaimed water the company intends to use  comes from sewage plants that treat human waste and water from activities that include bathing and food preparation, according to Texas regulators. City officials say the deal will provide a steady stream of revenue and reduces truck traffic.""We didn't think we were making our highest and best use of our effluent water, we were using a lot for irrigation,"" said Larry Long, the Odessa city attorney who helped to negotiate the deal with Pioneer. ""We thought it had more value going to the oil companies,"" he said, noting that it would allow potable water currently going to the oil fields to be put to other uses.EOG Resources Inc, which has wells in the Eagle Ford formation in South Texas, is considering using water from wastewater treatment plants, according to its web site. And Anadarko Petroleum Corp uses treated water purchased from the city of Aurora in Colorado, according to a spokesman.Alpha Reclaim, a private Houston company owned by BNN Energy that supplies reclaimed water to oil companies in Texas, has dealings or contracts with about 30 cities in Texas, including Big Lake in the western part of the state.

1222,"   By Anna Driver | HOUSTON  HOUSTON Top shale oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co (PXD.N) has found an unusual way to both save water and cut costs for its wells: tapping the treated runoff from toilets, sinks and showers in west Texas. Pioneer has signed an 11-year, $117 million deal with the city of Odessa, Texas that will guarantee it access to millions of gallons of treated municipal wastewater each day, for use in nearby oilfields. Deliveries of the so-called effluent, are expected to start at the end of the year.As crude oil has slid to its lowest level in six years - currently about $40 a barrel - oil and gas companies pumping from shale rock have tried to cut every unnecessary penny from their operations. Water acquisition and transportation can be up to 10 percent of the cost of drilling and fracking a well, according to consulting firm IHS.Producers are also trying to mitigate long-term risks of water scarcity in the arid Permian Basin of West Texas, where the top U.S. oilfield is situated.Oil and gas companies operating in area, including Pioneer and Apache Corp (APA.N), have long sought cheaper, more environmentally sound sources of water to use for fracking. For example, both companies have drawn some of the water they use in their operations from the Permian's brackish aquifers, which contain water unfit for drinking. Both companies also have worked to recycle water that is used for frack jobs or found in the ground while drilling. During hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, million of gallons of water are blasted, along with sand and chemicals, into a well drilled through shale or other rocks. The high-pressure slurry cracks the rock, allowing oil and gas to escape and exit the well.Pioneer is the first oil and gas company to sign a long-term wastewater supply contract with Odessa, a city of about 110,000 people. The Dallas-based company recently began construction on a pipeline network that will transport the treated water from the city's sewage plant to one of its oilfields about 20 miles away. ""The money has been approved,"" said Stephen McNair, president of Pioneer's water management group.  Pioneer's goal is to eliminate the use of fresh water in fracking in 5 to 10 years, said McNair.The municipal reclaimed water the company intends to use  comes from sewage plants that treat human waste and water from activities that include bathing and food preparation, according to Texas regulators.City officials say the deal will provide a steady stream of revenue and reduces truck traffic. ""We didn't think we were making our highest and best use of our effluent water, we were using a lot for irrigation,"" said Larry Long, the Odessa city attorney who helped to negotiate the deal with Pioneer. ""We thought it had more value going to the oil companies,"" he said, noting that it would allow potable water currently going to the oil fields to be put to other uses.  EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N), which has wells in the Eagle Ford formation in South Texas, is considering using water from wastewater treatment plants, according to its web site. And Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) uses treated water purchased from the city of Aurora in Colorado, according to a spokesman.

1242,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Arathy S Nair | NEW YORK/BENGALURU  NEW YORK/BENGALURU Oil and gas producer Marathon Oil Corp's plans to buy a small Oklahoma producer is the latest signal U.S. shale companies are pouncing on properties in the state's high margin STACK basin as the price of oil rebounds. Marathon Oil said Monday it would purchase PayRock Energy Holdings LLC for $888 million from venture capital firm EnCap Investments. PayRock currently produces about 9,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day in the Anadarko Basin STACK play in Oklahoma. The deal comes after Devon Energy Corp's recent buy of about 80,000 net surface acres in the STACK play from privately held Felix Energy - also part of EnCap's portfolio - for $1.9 billion.The STACK, or Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties play, lies in the Anadarko Basin, which covers about 60,000 square miles in western Oklahoma, southwestern Kansas, and parts of the Texas Panhandle and southeastern Colorado. The play has emerged as a top investment priority for several companies, including Continental, Devon and Marathon Oil in the past year largely because the cost to operate wells in this area is lower than other parts of the United States. That, in part, has made it a prime opportunity for investment as oil prices recover after plumbing 12-year lows earlier this year.  Rig counts have now increased for three weeks in a row, as crude prices recover to near $50 a barrel, suggesting a shift in producers' strategies.More recently in May, Newfield Exploration Co agreed to buy 42,000 net acres in the STACK play for $470 million from a unit of Chesapeake Energy Corp. Marathon Oil had agreed to sell non-core assets for $950 million in April, bringing its total sales through divestitures to about $1.3 billion since last August.    ""It is a little bit of a change, compared to what we've been hearing lately in M&A,"" Imre Kugler, senior consultant in North America Upstream at IHS, said. He said until recently, companies had been focused on selling assets not crucial to their businesses, but the latest Marathon Oil transaction is ""more of an aggressive move.""The most recent production numbers suggest the STACK play is seeing more activity. Continental Resources Inc said production from STACK more than tripled to 11,127 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the first quarter from the year-ago period. Devon's production from the area soared about 39 percent to 91,000 boepd.  To be sure, the play is still in its early stages, but analysts have expressed optimism in its growing potential. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Sunday that STACK should ""power capital efficient production growth"" for Devon, Marathon Oil and Continental Resources.Shares of Marathon Oil rose 11.5 percent to $14.67 a share in afternoon trading.

1246,"   By Mike Stone and Devika  Krishna Kumar | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Acquisition-hungry energy companies are back on the prowl.Dealmakers have recovered from the shock of Britain's ""Brexit"" vote last month to leave the European Union and have resumed buying oil and gas fields in choice locations in Canada and the United States, restocking their inventories on a bet that a two-year slump in the price of oil has abated.""Buyers are increasingly confident in a stable to slowly increasing oil price - as are their funding sources, whether private equity funds or public market investors,"" said Bobby Tudor, chief executive of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, an oil and gas investment bank.Oil prices CLc1 have held steady at or above $45 a barrel for a majority of the last two months and touched a 2016 high above $51, ahead of the British referendum.Tudor said buyers were banking on it eventually settling at around $60 a barrel, giving them confidence about buying drilling acreage in some of the nation's shale heartlands.U.S. oil and gas producer Diamondback Energy Inc (FANG.O) last week said it would spend $560 million buying leases on oil-rich land in the Southern Delaware Basin, within the Permian Basin, the top U.S. oilfield, where initial production results have been strong and costs are coming down.A day later, U.S. energy company Laredo Petroleum Inc (LPI.N) said it would spend $125 million buying acreage in the Midland Basin, also part of the Permian.These deals mark a resumption in buying after Brexit caused a temporary lull in acquisitions.Before the British referendum on June 23, buyers and sellers had grown comfortable with the idea that oil had rebounded from 12-year lows. That conviction helped to unclog the acquisition pipeline after a long-dormant period in which deals were offered but failed to materialize.About $5.1 billion of U.S. and Canadian properties traded hands in June, the largest dollar amount in more than a year according to PLS Inc, global M&A database for such deals.Acreage deals create confidence and open the door to acquisitions of entire companies, so long as oil remains relatively steady, according to nearly a dozen dealmakers interviewed by Reuters.More acreage deals are in the works, including ones that involve large exploration and production (E&P) companies such as Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) and Southwestern Energy Co  (SWN.N), according to people familiar with the matter. Restructuring bankers and attorneys anticipate that exploration and production companies that have emerged from bankruptcy, like Magnum Hunter Resources, or are going through the process, like Ultra Petroleum Corp [UPLMQ.PK], will be merger and acquisition targets for other oil and gas companies because they are financially healthy, having eliminated much of their debt.Magnum Hunter and Ultra Petroleum did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Publicly traded companies are warming up to deals now, a change from when deals were mainly stagnant or acreage was sold to private equity firms in small transactions. Traditional E&P companies dominated acquisition activity in the second quarter, representing 69 percent and 76 percent of total transactions and deal value, respectively, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Thursday.PRICE AND PRIME LOCATIONS The key dynamic that has developed and allowed buyers and sellers to get back to cutting deals is price.  Greater stability around the price of oil has enabled both sides to negotiate, where previously expectations of further falls kept them apart.Leading into the spate of deals in June was a nine-week period of relatively low oil volatility, when prices rose about 20 percent and traded between about $40 and $50 a barrel.  Transactions in June occurred at prices about 10 percent higher than the far forward crude price for three years out CLc36, according to bankers. That implies that buyers and sellers could agree upon a price of about $60 per barrel, the bankers said.That forward price has now returned to its pre-Brexit levels of about $54 a barrel, enabling deals once again.Another key ingredient for completed deals was their location. Many of the sales occurred in areas with the highest margins where pumping at about $50 per barrel is profitable. The acreage most sought-after is in Texas' Permian Basin and in Oklahoma's STACK area (Sooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Counties), popular because of their easy-to-extract rock formations and relatively low break-even prices.     In June, Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) said it would spend about $888 million to acquire STACK acreage and Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) said it would sell Texas acreage to Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD.N) and an undisclosed buyer for $858 million.HOPING FOR HIGHER OIL PRICES     While there could be hurdles such as resurgent output and deceleration in demand growth over the next few months, many producers are more bullish on the prices of oil long-term.""Investors have become overly bearish on oil as concerns over rising U.S. rig activity and high fuel inventories raised doubts about the rebalancing of the market. We think those concerns are unwarranted,"" ANZ said in a note.""We think any further decline in prices will accelerate the supply closures again and set the stage for an even stronger price recovery in 2017.""On Friday, U.S. oil prices ended the week 1 percent higher.

1248,"  HOUSTON U.S. oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co posted a second-quarter net loss on Wednesday that widened from a year earlier on $229 million in losses on derivatives it uses to insulate its revenues from volatile oil prices.Pioneer, known for its aggressive hedging program and for being one of the most efficient oil producers in the Permian Basin of West Texas, said its second quarter net loss was $268 million, wider than $218 million a year ago.It was the first time in a year that the company posted derivatives losses and the biggest such loss in five years, according to filings. Oil prices rose to hover between $40 and $50 barrel for much of the second quarter, surprising some analysts after bottoming at $27 a barrel in the first quarter.Excluding derivatives losses, the adjusted loss was $37 million. Revenue in the latest quarter was $786 million, up 22 percent from the same period last year.Pioneer reiterated on Wednesday it would start drilling more as oil prices improve and now that its capital spending program has been raised to $2.1 billion from $2.0 billion. Pioneer bought Texas shale acreage from Devon Energy Corp last month for $435 million, issuing 5.3 million shares to help fund the deal. Pioneer also said that it planned to add five drilling rigs to Texas starting in September, bringing its total count in the state to 17. Pioneer expects to spend about $2.1 billion this year on its capital budget. Pioneer has been one of the leaders in the U.S. shale oil industry in technological development, with improved fracking techniques helping to stabilize the company's production this year and offset slipping crude prices.

1250,"  (Repeats to additional subscribers, no changes to headline or text)By Terry WadeHOUSTON, July 28 Improved fracking techniques have helped cut Pioneer Natural Resources Co's  production costs in the Permian Basin to about $2 a barrel, low enough to compete with oil rival Saudi Arabia, CEO Scott Sheffield said on Thursday.The comments from Sheffield, who is retiring soon, were perhaps the most concrete sign yet that the fittest U.S. shale oil producers will survive the price crash that started in mid-2014 when Saudi Arabia and OPEC moved to pump heavily to win back market share from higher-cost producers.Dozens of shale companies, many with marginal assets, have filed for credit protection in the biggest wave of corporate bankruptcies since the telecoms crash of the early 2000s. Sheffield said high costs would continue to make U.S. shale plays outside the Permian basin relatively less competitive.On Pioneer's second-quarter results call, Sheffield said that, excluding taxes, production costs have fallen to $2.25 a barrel on horizontal wells in the Permian Basin of West Texas, so it is nearly on even footing with low-cost producers of conventional oil. ""Definitely we can compete with anything that Saudi Arabia has,"" he said.""My firm belief is the Permian is going to be the only driver of long-term oil growth in this country. And it's going to grow on up to about 5 million barrels a day from 2 million barrels,"" even in a $55 per barrel price environment, he added.Oil traded near $50 a barrel for much of the second quarter but is currently around $42. Pioneer's shares were up more than 3 percent on Thursday at $155.91 each. Sheffield said other U.S. shale plays, notably the Bakken in North Dakota and the Eagle Ford in South Texas, may not be able to weather the downturn as well given their higher costs.""The Bakken and the Eagle Ford I think there's no way they can recover to the levels that they've already had,"" he said.Pioneer expects output to grow 15 percent a year through 2020 after posting production of 233,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day this past quarter. It sees most of its growth in the Permian, though it also has acreage in the Eagle Ford. Pioneer helps limit costs by doing much of its oilfield services work in-house. It also has its own sand mine, and uses effluent water from the city of Odessa for frack jobs using pressurized sand, water and chemicals to unlock oil from rock.Pioneer said it is now introducing its third generation of well completion techniques, called version 3.0, that is using even more sand and water than the super-sized volumes introduced at the start of the price crash to pull more oil out of rock.Its newest wells are using up to 1,700 pounds per foot of sand, up to 50 barrels per foot of fluid, and frack points as often as every 15 feet with wells that are now nearly 10,000 feet long.Wells fracked using completion techniques known as version 2.0 have produced about 2,000 barrels per day in their early days, double what they were producing with earlier wells.While the newest wells appear more productive, the company declined to say what output from wells fracked with the third generation completion techniques would ultimately be, partly because it chokes, or restricts, initial output from new wells to ensure their longevity.

It also has its own sand mine, and uses effluent water from the city of Odessa for frack jobs using pressurized sand, water and chemicals to unlock oil from rock.Pioneer said it is now introducing its third generation of well completion techniques, called version 3.0, that is using even more sand and water than the super-sized volumes introduced at the start of the price crash to pull more oil out of rock. Its newest wells are using up to 1,700 pounds per foot of sand, up to 50 barrels per foot of fluid, and frack points as often as every 15 feet with wells that are now nearly 10,000 feet long.Wells fracked using completion techniques known as version 2.0 have produced about 2,000 barrels per day in their early days, double what they were producing with earlier wells.While the newest wells appear more productive, the company declined to say what output from wells fracked with the third generation completion techniques would ultimately be, partly because it chokes, or restricts, initial output from new wells to ensure their longevity.

1253,"  HOUSTON U.S. oil producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co posted a second-quarter net loss on Wednesday that widened from a year earlier on $229 million in losses on derivatives it uses to insulate its revenues from volatile oil prices.Pioneer, known for its aggressive hedging program and for being one of the most efficient oil producers in the Permian Basin of West Texas, said its second quarter net loss was $268 million, wider than $218 million a year ago.It was the first time in a year that the company posted derivatives losses and the biggest such loss in five years, according to filings. Oil prices rose to hover between $40 and $50 barrel for much of the second quarter, surprising some analysts after bottoming at $27 a barrel in the first quarter.Excluding derivatives losses, the adjusted loss was $37 million. Revenue in the latest quarter was $786 million, up 22 percent from the same period last year.Pioneer reiterated on Wednesday it would start drilling more as oil prices improve and now that its capital spending program has been raised to $2.1 billion from $2.0 billion. Pioneer bought Texas shale acreage from Devon Energy Corp last month for $435 million, issuing 5.3 million shares to help fund the deal. Pioneer also said that it planned to add five drilling rigs to Texas starting in September, bringing its total count in the state to 17. Pioneer expects to spend about $2.1 billion this year on its capital budget. Pioneer has been one of the leaders in the U.S. shale oil industry in technological development, with improved fracking techniques helping to stabilize the company's production this year and offset slipping crude prices.

1261,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 31 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of Pitney Bowes Inc. (PBI) and its subsidiary, Pitney Bowes  International Holdings, Inc. (PBIH) at â€˜BBB-â€™. The Rating Outlook has been  revised to Stable from Negative. The Stable Outlook reflects the actions taken  by Pitney Bowes to reduce debt and leverage and improve its operations. A full  list of ratings actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings are supported by: the significant and entrenched market position in  the core U.S. Mailing business; the necessity of mail equipment and services to  conduct business across all industries; the diversity of the companyâ€™s customer  base, from both an industry and size perspective. PBI has stated its commitment to investment grade metrics, although these  metrics and their levels have not been defined. Fitch believes that the actions  taken in 2013 demonstrate that PBI is committed to maintaining investment grade  ratings. These actions include the reduction in its quarterly dividend from  $0.375 to $0.1875 per share, a 50% reduction, resulting in a saving of  approximately $150 million per year. In addition, the company used proceeds from  the sale of its Management Services business to redeem its $300 million in  senior notes due in 2014. Over the last two years, PBI has reduced its total debt from $4.5 billion in  2011 to $3.6 billion at the end of 2013 (totals include PBIHâ€™s preferred  security). Fitch calculated unadjusted gross leverage has declined from 4.7x in  2011 to approximately 4.3x (leverage metrics for both periods are pro forma for  operating divestures), and core leverage has declined a full turn over the same  period. Fitch expects 2014 year-end total leverage to remain at 4.3x.  Fitch is not expecting material acquisition or share buyback activity, and there  is limited room within the ratings for any share buyback activity. Any  debt-funded share buyback activity or a material debt funded acquisition would  be outside of current ratings.  Fitch continues to be concerned with the continued revenue declines. Enterprise  business ended the 2013 year up 3.5% and digital commerce solutions was up 3.1%.  However, these gains were unable to fully offset the declines in the North  American small- and medium-sized businesses, which was down 5.3%. Total revenue  for 2013 was down 1.3%. Fitch notes that in the last three quarters, PBI has  delivered positive year-over-year revenue growth in equipment sales. Continued  positive growth in equipment sales could lead to improved financing, rental and  supply revenues. PBI has provided revenue guidance of down 1% to up 2%, on a  constant currency basis; Fitch believes this is achievable. There is limited  room in the ratings for PBI to fall short on these revenue expectations.  Ratings concerns include the secular and cyclical pressures inherent to the  business and top-line declines. The ratings also consider event risk, faced by  bondholders of all companies faced with secular challenges and underperforming  equity, of a potentially more aggressive financial policy and capital structure.  Fitch believes cyclical pressures accelerate the well-documented secular  challenges, as customers could look to digital mailing as a cost-reduction  mechanism, and choose to keep existing equipment. The acceleration of digital  substitution for physical transaction mail results in reduced need for PBIâ€™s  mailing equipment. Although the majority of PBIâ€™s revenue is not directly tied  to mail volume, Fitch believes continued mail volume declines could drive  reduced equipment needs, whether in terms of size, number or functionality.  PBIâ€™s initiatives to position itself more as a digital and services company  could gain traction. That said, in the near term, these initiatives will be  challenged in offsetting the declines in the high-margin North American mailing  space. These products could cannibalize existing physical business, but Fitch  believes such a strategy is unavoidable, given ongoing digital substitution. Liquidity Pitney Bowesâ€™ liquidity position at Dec. 31, 2013 was solid, consisting of: $908  million of cash; and an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility maturing in  April 2016, which backstops the companyâ€™s $1 billion commercial paper program.  Liquidity is further supported by the companyâ€™s annual free cash flow (FCF)  generation. Fitch calculates estimates 2013 FCF at approximately $300 million. Fitchâ€™s  current base case projections estimate annual FCF at $200 million-$250 million  for the next few years. Fitchâ€™s FCF calculation deducts Pitney Bowes common and  preferred dividend payments and does not add back cash flows associated with  restructuring payments, and tax payments related to sales of leveraged lease  assets. Pitney Bowes faces material annual maturities over the next several years.  However, Fitch recognizes that the company can address a significant portion of  its maturities organically with its pre-dividend FCF generation. As of Dec. 31, 2013, Pitney Bowesâ€™ total debt was $3.6 billion. Fitch estimates  that this consists of:  --$3.1 billion of senior unsecured debt, maturing between 2015-2022 ($2.2  billion), one maturing in 2037 ($500 million) and one maturing in 2043 ($425  million);  --$230 million in term loans due in 2015/2016;  --$300 million of variable-term voting preferred stock in the companyâ€™s  subsidiary, PBIH. Under Fitchâ€™s hybrid security criteria, Fitch assigns 0%  equity credit given the less than five-year maturity (based on the October 2016  call date).  RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Given the secular challenges facing the company, Fitch does not expect  positive rating momentum in the near term. Sustainable revenue growth driven by  the companyâ€™s various product initiatives coupled with a commitment to continue  reducing absolute levels of debt may drive positive rating momentum.  Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --Lack of traction in the companyâ€™s digital initiatives and other growth  businesses amid ongoing declines in the traditional physical business. Also,  sustained revenue declines in the mid- to high-single-digits would pressure the  ratings;  --A sustained increase in total leverage from current levels, whether the result  of incremental debt or lower EBITDA; --Indications of a more aggressive financial policy.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: Pitney Bowes --IDR at â€˜BBB-â€™; --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility at â€˜BBB-â€™; --Senior unsecured term loan at â€˜BBB-â€™; --Senior unsecured notes at â€˜BBB-â€™; --Short-term IDR at â€˜F3â€™; --Commercial paper at â€˜F3â€™. PBIH --Long-term IDR at â€˜BBB-â€™; --Preferred stock at â€˜BBâ€™. The Outlook has been revised to Stable from Negative.

1262,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to Pitney  Bowes' (PBI) $500 million senior unsecured notes due 2024. PBI and its  subsidiary, Pitney Bowes International Holdings, Inc. (PBIH) have an Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of 'BBB-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. A full list of  ratings follows at the end of this release. The new notes will rank pari passu with existing senior unsecured securities.  The proposed notes include a change of control put offer of 101% upon a change  of control and subsequent downgrade of the notes to non-investment grade. A change of control includes any person/entity acquiring 50% or more of the voting  control of the company, majority of directors of the board cease to be  continuing directors, or a sale 85% or more of PBI's total consolidated assets  in one, or a series, of transactions. The proposed notes also include a  limitation on liens of up to 15% of consolidated net tangible assets (in  addition to standard carve outs). The proceeds of the new notes are expected to fund a cash tender offer  (announced yesterday) for an aggregate principal amount of $500 million of notes  with the following order of priorities: 1) 5.25% notes due 2037, $500 million outstanding; 2) 5.75% notes due 2017, $500 million outstanding; 3) 4.75% notes due 2016, $371 million outstanding; 4) 4.75% notes due 2018, $350 million outstanding; 5) 5.60% notes due 2018, $250 million outstanding. The tender offer expires on March 31, 2014. Notes that are tendered on or before  March 17, 2014 would receive an additional $30 in premium for every $1,000  tendered. Total consideration for the Notes due 2037 (Priority 1 Notes) is  $1,110 ($1,080 excluding the premium described above). Total consideration for  Priority Notes 2 to 5 will be based upon a fixed spread over the yield to  maturity of applicable U.S. Treasury Securities as specified in the Offer to  Purchase and Letter of Transmittal documents.  Fitch views the transaction as credit neutral as pro forma credit metrics remain  materially unchanged. If all of the 2037 notes accept the tender offer, $500  million in debt will shift to an earlier maturity bucket.

1266,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Issuer Default  Rating (IDR) of Pitney Bowes Inc. and its subsidiary Pitney Bowes International  Holdings, Inc. (PBIH) at 'BBB-' and revised the Rating Outlook to Negative from  Stable.  Fitch has also assigned a 'BBB-' rating to Pitney Bowes Inc.'s (PBI) $600  million of 3.375% senior unsecured notes due 2021. Net offering proceeds are to  be used to repay $300 million of existing 6.125% preferred stock callable in  October 2016 and for general corporate purposes including potential debt  repayment.  A full list of ratings actions follows at the end of this release. The Negative Outlook reflects PBI's gross leverage exceeding Fitch's negative  rating threshold of 4.0x. Fitch would likely stabilize the Outlook if the  company reduces leverage below 4.0x either through debt repayment or EBITDA  growth. Although Fitch views actions taken by the company including divesting  underperforming assets and consequent debt reduction as positive, continued  headwinds in mailing and software contribute to the Negative Outlook. Fitch believes the ongoing secular issues will challenge the company's ability  to maintain a credit profile indicative of an investment grade rating. If these  issues continue over the near-term, Fitch will likely reconsider the current  4.0x maximum total leverage threshold for the current rating, which would  increase negative rating pressure. KEY RATING DRIVERS Market Leadership: The ratings are supported by PBI's significant and entrenched  market position in the core U.S. Mailing business, the necessity of mail  equipment and services to conduct business across all industries, and the  diversity of the company's customer base, from both an industry and size  perspective. Top Line Declines: Fitch continues to be concerned with overall top-line  declines, driven by weakness in its small and medium-sized business (SMB)  segment, although the declines have been moderating. In constant currency  revenue, SMB ended the 2015 fiscal year down 5%, driven by continuing declines  in installed meters and weakness in international markets. The Enterprise  business was flat, as lower service revenue in production mail was partially  offset by increased volumes in presort services. Digital commerce solutions  increased 9%, driven by the acquisition of Borderfree, Inc. and higher volume of  packages shipped from the U.K. Within Digital commerce, software revenues  declined 10% on a reported basis in 2015 due to sales execution issues. Cyclical Pressures Compound Secular: Fitch believes secular pressures accelerate  PBI's challenges, as customers could look to digital mailing as a cost-reduction  mechanism, and choose to keep existing equipment. The acceleration of digital  substitution for physical transaction mail results in reduced need for PBI's  mailing equipment. Although the majority of PBI's revenue is not directly tied  to mail volume, Fitch believes continued mail volume declines will drive reduced  equipment needs, whether in terms of size, number or functionality. Transition Underway: Fitch views PBI's initiatives to position itself more as a  digital services company positively, and they continue to show traction. For FY  2015, Digital Commerce Solutions constituted 21% of total revenue, up from 14%  in FY 2014. However, in the near term, these initiatives will be challenged to  offset the declines in the high-margin North American mailing segment. While  these initiatives could cannibalize existing physical business, Fitch believes  such a strategy is unavoidable, given ongoing digital substitution. Conservative Financial Policy: Although PBI has stated its commitment to  investment grade metrics, they have not publicly defined metrics. Fitch believes  that various actions taken over the last few years demonstrate PBI's commitment.  PBI has reduced its total debt (including preferred securities) from $4.5  billion in 2011 to $3.4 billion at June 30, 2016. Unadjusted pro forma gross  total leverage has declined from 4.7x in 2011 to approximately 4.3x and core  leverage has gone from 4.3x to approximately 3.9x pro forma for the issuance  (assuming the remaining $300 million of net proceeds is used for debt repayment  after the preferred stock is repaid). KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for PBI include: --flat to low single digit top line improvement on a constant currency basis; --Minimal margin improvement as a majority of the company's expected cost  savings have been realized; --No material change to stated dividend;  --$215 million of share repurchases in 2016; --Majority of maturities are refinanced. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive: Given the secular challenges facing the company, Fitch does not expect  positive rating momentum in the near term. Sustainable revenue growth driven by  the company's various product initiatives coupled with a commitment to continue  reducing absolute levels of debt may drive positive rating momentum. Negative: Future developments that may, individually or collectively, lead to a  negative rating action include: --Lack of traction in the company's digital initiatives and other growth  businesses amid ongoing declines in the traditional physical business; --A change in the company's strategy indicating a willingness to operate above  4.0x; --Indications of a more aggressive financial policy. LIQUIDITY PBI's liquidity position at June 30, 2016 was solid, consisting of $676 million  of cash on hand and an undrawn $1 billion revolving credit facility maturing in  January 2020, which backstops the company's $1 billion commercial paper program.  Liquidity is further supported by the company's annual FCF generation. Fitch calculates FY 2015 FCF at $180 million. Fitch's current base case  projections estimate annual FCF at $150 million-$250 million for the rating  horizon. Fitch's FCF calculation deducts PBI's common and preferred dividend  payments and does not add back cash flows associated with restructuring  payments, and tax payments related to sales of leveraged lease assets. PBI faces  material annual maturities over the next several years. However, Fitch  recognizes that the company can address a significant portion of its maturities  organically with its pre-dividend FCF generation and accessing the capital  markets. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has assigned the ratings for Pitney Bowes Inc. as follows: --$600 million senior unsecured notes due 2021 'BBB-'; Fitch has affirmed the ratings as follows: Pitney Bowes --IDR at 'BBB-'; --Senior Unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured term loan at 'BBB-'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB-'; --Short-term IDR at 'F3'; --Commercial paper at 'F3'. PBIH --Long-term IDR at 'BBB-'; --Preferred stock at 'BB'. The Rating Outlook is Negative.

1269,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 16 (Fitch) PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) reported a  solid 1.34% return-on-asset (ROA) during the fourth quarter of 2013 (4Q'13),  according to Fitch Ratings. PNC's results benefitted from a release from  mortgage repurchase reserves, lower provision expenses, and a modest improvement  in spread income. However, these gains were partially offset by higher expenses.  The release of mortgage repurchase reserves was from previously disclosed  agreements with both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the quarter, resolving  repurchase obligations related to loans sold between 2000 and 2008. Fitch views  these settlements favorably as it addresses a great deal of legacy  mortgage-related risk. With regard to core mortgage results, mortgage  originations fell 32% on linked-quarter basis. While better than other banks  reporting to date, the decrease for PNC was still expected given the drop-off in  refinancing activities.  PNC also reported a large increase in its estimated Tier 1 common ratio (CET1)  under Basel III, an estimated 9.4% CET1 ratio at year-end 2013, up 70 basis  points (bps) from prior quarter-end. PNC attributed the increase to lower  deductions from quantitative limits and improved AOCI from changes related to  pension assets, offset by an increase in risk-weighted assets. Fitch views the  improvement favorably as it places PNC's capital ratios much closer to peer  averages. Further, the company is well above its current guideline of between 8%  and 8.5%, likely paving the way for a higher capital request under 2014 CCAR  than the year before.  PNC reported a modest increase in spread income and a significant increase in  noninterest income, primarily due to the aforementioned mortgage repurchase  reserve release. Excluding this release, noninterest income was flat on a  sequential basis.  Lower mortgage revenues from smaller net hedging gains on mortgage servicing  rights were offset primarily by higher asset management revenues, driven by  stronger equity markets and growth. Also impacting linked-quarter comparisons,  PNC reported an $85 million pre-tax gain on the sale of Visa shares in 3Q'13.  PNC reported a 5% increase in noninterest expenses from higher incentive  compensation, a $50 million contribution to PNC Foundation, and higher legal  accruals, including the previously disclosed residential mortgage fair lending  joint settlement with the CFPB and DOJ. This fine related to legacy National  City Bank activities. Legal-related charges continue to weigh on results for the  large banks, though at much smaller level for PNC and the other large regional  banks in comparison to the money center banks.  PNC reported a 9bps decline in the net interest margin due to higher balances of  interest-bearing deposits at banks in anticipation of new regulatory  requirements, namely the October 2013 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) proposal.  PNC has not publicly disclosed its estimate of the LCR. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion on the net interest margin  (NIM), PNC's core NIM declined 7bps on a linked-quarter basis to 3.10%, which is  likely somewhat below the average for the large regional banks.  Credit quality continues to generally improve for PNC, and the company reported  still low net charge-offs (NCOs) of just 39 bps during 4Q'13. PNC's NCOs can be  a bit lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, ranging from 39 bps this quarter to 99 bps  in 1Q'13. Reported nonaccrual assets also declined 4% on a sequential basis.  Quarterly earnings benefitted from a loan loss reserve release with NCOs  exceeding provision expenses, though at only 5% of pre-tax income, it is not  considered to be a driver of quarterly earnings growth.

1273,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 16 (Fitch) PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) reported a  solid 1.35% return on asset (ROA) during the first quarter of 2014 (1Q'14),  supported by lower expenses and credit costs, offset by lower repurchase reserve  releases and seasonality in fee income, according to Fitch Ratings. Fitch views  these results as consistent with PNC's credit profile, with ratings that remain  among some of the highest in the world.  Similar to other banks reporting to date, spread income declined during the  quarter, reflecting two fewer days and lower purchase accounting accretion  (PAA). PNC reported a sizeable 12 basis points (bps) decline in the net interest  margin (NIM) due to lower asset yields and less PAA. PNC expects that net  interest income will be down modestly in 2Q'14 relative to this quarter.  Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion on the NIM, PNC's core NIM  declined 8 bps a linked-quarter basis to 3.02%, below the average for the large  regional banks. Although PNC's margin continues to compress, PNC loan growth is  solid and the company has good revenue diversity, with noninterest income  comprising 42% of revenues during the quarter, insulating the company somewhat  from a very challenging interest rate environment.    Noninterest income declined 12% on a linked-quarter basis mainly reflecting a  much lower mortgage repurchase reserve release and seasonal declines in fee  income. This was partially offset by a $62 million pre-tax gain on the sale of  Visa shares. PNC reported a sizeable 10% decrease in noninterest expenses from a continued  focus on expense management, as well as lower compensation costs, pension and  benefit costs. Last quarter's expenses also included a $50 million contribution  to PNC Foundation, and higher legal accruals, including the previously disclosed  residential mortgage fair lending joint settlement with the CFPB and DOJ. This  fine related to legacy National City Bank activities.  Credit quality continues to improve for PNC, and the company reported still low  net charge-offs (NCOs) of just 38 bps during 1Q'14. PNC's NCOs can be a bit  lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, ranging from 38 bps this quarter to 99 bps in  1Q'13. Reported nonaccrual assets also declined 5% on a sequential basis.  Quarterly earnings benefitted from a loan loss reserve release with NCOs  exceeding provision expenses, though at only 6% of pre-tax income, it is not  considered to be a driver of quarterly earnings. PNC continued to enhance its liquidity position in anticipation of new  regulatory requirements, namely the October 2013 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)  proposal. PNC has not publicly disclosed its estimate of the LCR, though the  loan to deposit ratio is 89% at March 31, 2014. While Fitch expects this ratio  could rise as loan growth resumes to more normalized levels, Fitch expects PNC  will manage its liquidity position in a conservative manner, as it has  historically done so.  PNC also reported a further increase in its estimated fully phased-in Tier 1  common ratio (CET1) under Basel III, up 30 bps to an estimated 9.7% CET1 ratio  at March 31, 2014. PNC attributed the increase to growth in retained earnings  and higher AOCI, partially offset by higher risk-weighted assets. PNC received  no objection to its capital plan under CCAR, and performed well under the  regulatory stress testing relative to other large regional banks, with a minimum  tier 1 common ratio of 8.1% after proposed capital plans, which is a very strong  ratio in light of the onerous stress test.

1274,"   By Nate Raymond and Aruna Viswanatha | NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  NEW YORK/WASHINGTON May 29 The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan is investigating at least five banks over whether they overcharged the government for expenses incurred during foreclosures on federally backed home loans, filings and interviews show.PNC Financial Services Group Inc, PHH Corp, MetLife Inc, Santander Holdings USA Inc and Citizens Financial Group Inc, the U.S. unit of Royal Bank of Scotland , have all disclosed in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that they've received subpoenas. U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara's office is seeking information on claims on foreclosed loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to records reviewed by Reuters.The subpoenas, coming years after the height of the foreclosure crisis, seek information about banks' foreclosure-related expenses, which generally include court filings and posting or mailing legal notices.""You've got a lot of people trying to clean up the servicing industry, but the truth is we are seeing the same servicing problems over and over,"" said Ira Rheingold, director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates in Washington. ""It was built into the model to charge as many fees as they could.""At least one of the subpoenas sent to a bank specifically asks about expenses by New York law firms, one person familiar with the matter said.The probe is being conducted pursuant to the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, according to Citizens Financial, which on May 12 became the most recent bank to disclose receiving a subpoena. Passed in response to the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s, the law has become a key tool of the Justice Department in pursuing cases against banks. An earlier investigation by Bharara's office of the improper approval of FHA-insured loans relied on FIRREA as well as another law, the False Claims Act, and resulted in $1.1 billion in settlements with JPMorgan Chase & Co, Deutsche Bank AG, Citigroup Inc and Flagstar Bancorp. In another case being pursued under FIRREA, Bharara's office has been seeking $2.1 billion from Bank of America Corp after a federal jury last year found it liable for fraud over defective mortgages sold by its Countrywide unit to Fannie and Freddie.About 10 percent of the loans serviced by large U.S. servicers between 2009 and 2012 were either delinquent or in foreclosure, according to industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance. The total amount of the loans is between $6 trillion and $7 trillion.Representatives for Bharara, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees FHA, Fannie Mae, and Fannie and Freddie's regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, declined comment. Freddie Mac spokesman Brad German said the company is aware of the investigation and ""cooperating fully."" PNC, Citizens, Santander, and MetLife declined comment. PHH didn't respond to requests for comment.PROBE OF LAW FIRMS In their SEC disclosures, three banks said they received subpoenas in May 2013. While the disclosures do not provide much detail on the scope of the probe, two banks, PNC and MetLife, said federal authorities are looking at foreclosure-related costs incurred by law firms. MetLife said the Justice Department is looking at its supervision of those expenses. Similar expenses are the subject of the separate probe by Colorado Attorney General John Suthers, who is examining whether at least five local law firms misrepresented costs on a foreclosure and ultimately passed them on to prospective purchasers, investors, and taxpayers, in violation of Colorado consumer protection laws, according to court filings.Foreclosures generally cost between $1,000 and $3,000, depending on the state and type of foreclosure, with the bulk going to legal fees. Other expenses, including posting and mailing notices, court filing costs and title searches, add to the total bill.The law firms under investigation in Colorado allegedly represented expenses that were much higher than their actual costs, in some cases by hundreds of dollars. One firm charged $150 for posting a notice on the door of a property in foreclosure, even though the market rate for that service was about $25, according to the allegations.Another allegedly represented court filing costs between $42 and $224 more than it was actually paying.Since October 2011, FHFA has directed Fannie and Freddie to require mortgage servicers to select law firms that meet certain criteria. Previously, the two companies, which together own or guarantee about 60 percent of all U.S. home loans, had directed servicers to use only lawyers that appeared on a list of firms approved by them.

1275,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 16 (Fitch) PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) reported a  solid 1.31% return on asset (ROA) during the second quarter of 2014 (2Q'14),  supported by strong fee income growth and lower credit costs, offset by higher  expenses and a continued decline in spread income. Reflecting a still uneven  economic recovery and a competitive lending environment, PNC grew loans only  1.4% on a linked-quarter basis, with commercial loan growth offset by continued  deleveraging in certain consumer asset classes. Fitch still views the quarter's  results as consistent with PNC's credit profile, with ratings that remain among  some of the highest in the world.  Reflecting an ongoing trend, spread income declined during the quarter,  reflecting lower loan yields and securities balances, and a reclassification of  certain commercial facility fees as noninterest incomes. Excluding the  reclassification of these fees, spread income was down 1.6% in 2Q'14. PNC also  reported a sizeable 14 basis points (bps) decline in the net interest margin  (NIM) due to lower asset yields and actions taken to improve liquidity, with 5  bps attributed to the reclassification of these fees.  Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion on the NIM, PNC's core NIM  declined 10 bps a linked-quarter basis to 2.92%, below the average for the large  regional banks. Although PNC's margin continues to compress and below peer  levels, PNC has good revenue diversity, with noninterest income comprising 44%  of revenues, insulating the company somewhat from a very challenging interest  rate environment.    Noninterest income increased 6% on a linked-quarter basis mainly reflecting fee  income growth, in part due to the commercial facility fees classification  change. PNC reported additional gains on the sale of VISA shares in 2Q'14, with  $54 million in securities gains this quarter, down slightly from $62 million  last quarter. Excluding these items, core noninterest income was up 5% in 2Q'14  on a sequential basis.   PNC reported a 3% increase in noninterest expenses due to seasonally higher  personnel expenses and incentive compensation costs, as well as increased  marketing costs. PNC expects that expenses may be up low single digits in 3Q'14  relative to 2Q'14.  Credit quality continues to improve for PNC, and the company reported very low  net charge-offs (NCOs) of just 29 bps during 2Q'14. Reflecting the continued  improvement in credit quality, provision expense declined 23% during the  quarter. Quarterly earnings once again benefitted from a loan loss reserve  release with NCOs exceeding provision expenses, though at only 5% of pre-tax  income, it is not considered to be a driver of quarterly earnings. PNC continued to enhance its liquidity position in anticipation of new  regulatory requirements, namely the October 2013 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)  proposal. PNC continued to maintain higher deposit balances with the Federal  Reserve, and higher borrowed funds balances. Borrowed funds have increased 23%  from a year-ago, with most of the issuance completed at the bank-level. PNC has  not publicly disclosed its estimate of the LCR. PNC also reported a further increase in its estimated fully phased-in Tier 1  common ratio (CET1) under Basel III standardized approach rules, up 30 bps to an  estimated 10% CET1 ratio at June 30, 2014. The increase was due to growth in  retained earnings and higher unrealized securities gains, partially offset by  higher risk-weighted assets and share repurchases.

1277,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 07 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed PNC Financial Service  Group, Inc.'s (PNC) Issuer-Default Ratings (IDRs) at 'A+/F1'. The Rating Outlook  remains Stable. The affirmation reflects PNC's strong risk-adjusted earnings  profile, stable and diverse business model, and its consistency of performance  through time.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Financial Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holdings  Corporation (MUFG), PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - IDRs, VIABILITY RATINGS (VR) & SENIOR DEBT PNC's ratings were affirmed at 'A+/F1' and primarily reflect its strong  risk-adjusted earnings profile, stable and diverse business model, and  consistent performance through time.  PNC's earnings exceed the large regional peer average both now and through the  financial crisis, supported by high levels of non-interest income, a good  funding profile, and manageable credit costs. Fitch notes that although PNC's  core margin continues to compress and is below peer levels, PNC has good revenue  diversity, helping to insulate the company from a very challenging interest rate  environment. PNC enjoys a funding advantage relative to many of its peers, and  benefits from a strong deposit franchise, ranking in the top five in terms of  deposit market share in 80% of the 17 state footprint it operates in.  PNC's ratings are also supported by its consistent track record, which is  attributed to a moderate risk appetite. Legacy PNC generally avoided subprime,  Alt-A mortgage lending, higher risk home equity and credit cards. Fitch views  PNC's management team very favorably, possessing the appropriate level of depth  and expertise, as well as a consistent approach to identifying, monitoring and  mitigating risk. Fitch notes that most of its recent earnings volatility and  elevated litigation costs are related to its acquisition of National City  Corporation. Absent this acquisition, many of its litigation and mortgage  repurchase-related charges would likely have been avoided, and PNC would have  fared very well through the financial crisis. Fitch notes that PNC's loan loss experience is more consistent and better than  peer averages. While NPAs remain elevated for PNC, actual NCOs consistently  track below peer averages. PNC's level of reserves to total loans was the second  highest of the large regional peer group at June 30, 2014, which Fitch views as  prudent given above average loan growth, and relatively higher credit risk in  its securities portfolio than its peer group.   PNC's capital profile compares well to other large regional banks and considered  solid relative to its risk profile. PNC performed very well under the two most  recent CCAR stress tests. Given its advanced-approach institution status, PNC  will face volatility in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) due to  interest rate movements, needing an associated capital buffer. As such, Fitch  expects that PNC will manage capital conservatively over the near- to  intermediate-term.  These rating strengths are somewhat offset by some tail risk related to  mortgage-related issues including pending and potential litigation which Fitch  has very little visibility into, and future risk related to home equity  end-of-draws. Fitch notes that PNC has reported one of the largest increases in  its reasonably possible legal losses in excess of amounts accrued (RPL) RPL  among the large regional banks from a year ago. While visibility into ultimate  legal risk is very limited, this proxy for possible legal risk would suggest PNC  is still facing elevated litigation costs over the near term. Fitch views home equity reset risk as an industry concern, though somewhat of a  more acute issue for PNC than its other large regional bank peers given the  relatively large home equity book. PNC has approximately $6.6 billion of home  equity lines of credit (currently paying interest only) resetting to fully  amortizing loans over the next few years, potentially at a higher interest rate  environment. PNC discloses that the performance of those borrowers that enter  the repayment period is significantly worse than those still in the draw period,  with 8% of borrowers more than 30 days past due at June 30, 2014. While this  warrants close monitoring, PNC's reserves and capital should be sufficient to  withstand higher levels of related delinquencies, losses and modifications.  Further, PNC has been monitoring this risk for several years now, and it is  incorporated into the loan loss reserves. Since the HELOCs set to convert  relatively evenly over the next several years, this should allow PNC to  restructure or provision without any overwhelming burden on one particular year.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - IDRs, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT As PNC is one of the highest-rated large regional banks, an upgrade is currently  viewed as unlikely over the near term. However, a sustained and meaningful  improvement in earnings that exceeds peer averages, without compromising the  company's risk parameters, which sustains a strong capital profile could lead to  ratings momentum over the long-term. PNC's ratings are underpinned by the stability in its strategic direction and  risk appetite. To the extent that PNC were to veer away from its historical  competencies, Fitch would evaluate any new strategic direction or increased risk  taking for rating implications. Viewed as also unlikely, there may be negative  ratings pressure if PNC were to report meaningful deterioration in asset  quality, coupled with weaker profitability metrics, or aggressive capital  management.  Fitch considers PNC's stake in BlackRock as providing an overall benefit to the  credit profile, since BlackRock's fees add an additional source of revenues to  the earnings mix. PNC may attempt to monetize some of its ownership in BlackRock  over time given the concentration risk that resides with such a large holding in  one company. BlackRock contributed approximately 10% of consolidated income in  1H14, and provided nice revenue diversification. As such, Fitch would monitor  any divestiture closely for ratings impact, as PNC's risk-adjusted earnings  profile is one of the key rating drivers.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - HOLDING COMPANY   PNC's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and banks,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary default probabilities.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - HOLDING COMPANY Should PNC's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. This is  viewed as unlikely though for PNC given the strength of the holding company  liquidity profile.  Fitch is now considering introducing a rating differential between the holding  company and bank in the U.S. due to structural changes in the sector and the  evolving regulatory landscape, as described in the special report 'U.S. Bank  HoldCos & OpCos: Evolving Risk Profiles', dated March 27, 2014. Given Fitch's  views that PNC may not receive a long-term debt requirement, its ratings may not  be impacted as a result of Fitch's evolving review regarding notching. KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  PNC has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, PNC is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR  PNC's Support Rating and Support Rating Floor are sensitive to Fitch's  assumption around capacity to procure extraordinary support in case of need.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES Subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by PNC and by various issuing  vehicles are all notched down from PNC or its bank subsidiaries' VRs in  accordance with Fitch's assessment of each instrument's respective  non-performance and relative loss severity risk profiles.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings of subordinated debt and other hybrid capital issued by PNC and its  subsidiaries are primarily sensitive to any change in PNC's VR.  KEY RATING DRIVERS - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of PNC's other major rated operating subsidiaries are equalized  with PNC's IDR reflecting Fitch's view that these entities are core to PNC's  business strategy and financial profile. These entities include: PNC Funding  Corp and National City Credit Corp, whose IDRs would be sensitive to the same  factors that might drive a change in PNC's IDR. RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of PNC to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in PNC's IDRs.  To the extent that one of PNC's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from PNC's IDR. KEY RATING DRIVERS - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS PNC's uninsured deposit ratings are rated one notch higher than the company's  IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  KEY RATING SENSITIVITIES - LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The ratings of long- and short-term deposits issued by PNC and its subsidiaries  are primarily sensitive to any change in PNC's long- and short-term IDRs.  Fitch has affirmed the followings: PNC Financial Services Group Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a+'; --Support at '5'; --Support floor at 'NF'; --Senior unsecured at 'A+'; --Subordinated at 'A'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB-'.

1278,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 15 (Fitch) PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) reported a  solid 1.25% return on asset (ROA) during the third quarter of 2014 (3Q'14),  supported by solid fee income growth and lower credit costs, partially offset by  a continued decline in spread income. Fitch Ratings views the quarter's results  as consistent with PNC's credit profile, with ratings that remain among some of  the highest in the world. PNC's ratings were recently affirmed at 'A+' during  the Oct. 7, 2014 large regional bank periodic review.  Reflecting a still uneven economic recovery and a competitive lending  environment, average loans were flat from the prior quarter. Some of the decline  in spread income was attributed to a higher liquidity position as PNC increased  total borrowings in preparation for the phase-in requirements of the LCR. PNC  disclosed that it would be well above the 80% minimum on Jan. 1, 2015.  Excluding the impact of purchase accounting accretion on the net interest margin  (NIM), PNC's core NIM declined 14 basis points (bps) on a linked-quarter basis  to 2.78%, well below the average for the large regional banks. Most of the  decline was attributed to increased balances at the Federal Reserve. Although  PNC's margin continues to compress and remains below peer levels, PNC has good  revenue diversity, with noninterest income comprising 45% of revenues,  insulating the company somewhat from a very challenging interest rate  environment.    Noninterest income increased 3% on a linked-quarter basis mainly reflecting fee  income growth, from higher asset management revenue, corporate service fees, and  deposit service charges. PNC reported additional gains on the sale of VISA  shares in 3Q'14, with $57 million in securities gains this quarter, up slightly  from $54 million last quarter. PNC has indicated that it intends to continue to  monetize its ownership of VISA shares, and as quarter-end 2014, still has  approximately $560 million of unrealized gains.  PNC reported relatively flat noninterest expenses, and has already met its  full-year 2014 savings goal of $500 million in expense savings. PNC expects that  expenses may be up low single digits in 4Q'14 relative to 3Q'14. Credit quality continues to improve for PNC, and the company reported very low  net charge-offs (NCOs) of only 16 bps during 3Q'14, an unsustainably low level  for the company and supported by net commercial loan recoveries. Reflecting the  continued improvement in credit quality, provision expense declined 24% during  the quarter. New non-performing loan (NPL) inflows fell to just $380 million  during the quarter, well below the amount a year ago or last quarter. Reserves  at 1.7% of loan losses will likely remain above the large regional bank peer  average.  PNC also reported a further increase in its estimated fully phased-in Tier 1  common ratio (CET1) under Basel III standardized approach rules, up 10bps to an  estimated 10.1% CET1 ratio at Sept. 30, 2014. The increase was due to growth in  retained earnings, partially offset by share repurchases.

1282,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 16 (Fitch) PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) reported a  solid 1.23% return on asset (ROA) during the fourth quarter of 2014 (4Q'14) and  1.28% for the full year. Quarterly earnings were supported by decent loan and  deposit growth, growth in fee income, and a still benign credit environment.  Fitch Ratings views the quarter's results as consistent with PNC's credit  profile, with ratings that remain among some of the highest in the world. PNC's  ratings are primarily supported by the consistency of performance over time. PNC reported revenue growth of 3%, mainly attributable to the sale of its  Washington DC regional headquarters building, and additional gains on the sales  of VISA shares. PNC reported $36 million in VISA-related gains in 4Q'14, down  from $57 million last quarter.  Excluding these two items, core noninterest income increased 2% on improved M&A  advisory fees, partially offset on lower earnings on PNC's equity investment in  BlackRock and a drop in mortgage results. At Dec. 31, 2014, PNC's economic  interest in BlackRock was 22%.  While spread income fell slightly due to lower purchase accounting accretion  (PAA), core net interest income increased 1%, supported by commercial loan  growth, partially offset by continued pressure on loan yields and higher bank  borrowings and senior notes used to enhance PNC's liquidity position. Excluding the impact of PAA on the NIM, PNC's core NIM declined 6 bps on a  linked-quarter basis to 2.72%, well below the average for the large regional  banks. Although PNC's margin continues to compress and remains below peer  levels, PNC has good revenue diversity, with noninterest income comprising a  healthy 47% of reported revenues in 4Q'14, insulating the company somewhat from  a very challenging interest rate environment.  Expenses ticked up 8% on a linked-quarter basis mainly reflective of a  charitable contribution to the PNC Foundation, higher legal and residential and  mortgage compliance costs, and increased fixed asset write-offs. Excluding the  elevated expense items outlined above, core expenses rose 2%, in line with peers  reporting to date. PNC expects that expenses may be down high single digits in  1Q'15 relative to 4Q'14.  The credit environment remains quite benign, and while NCOs increased 44% in  nominal terms (reflecting higher recoveries last quarter), NCOs remained low at  just 23bps in 4Q'14. However, Fitch notes that even with the uptick in credit  losses, NCOs are likely at unsustainably low levels for the company and the  industry. PNC indicated that its through the cycle loss expectations are between  50bps and 60bps. With regard to energy exposure, PNC disclosed it has a total of $2.9bn in  outstandings to the oil and gas sector, or approximately 2% of the total  commercial lending portfolio. PNC also reported that just $300m in loans in its  oil & gas services portfolio of $1.3 billion were to sub-investment grade  borrowers.  PNC reported its estimated fully phased-in Tier 1 common ratio (CET1) under  Basel III standardized approach rules fell 10bps to an estimated 10% CET1 at  YE2014. The slight decline was due to growth in retained earnings, partially  offset by growth in standardized approach risk-weighted assets. In Fitch's view,  PNC, and its similarly-sized regional bank peers, will not be subject to any  capital surcharge under the proposed rules announced in early December.  PNC also disclosed that its estimated pro forma Liquidity Coverage Ratio was  100% and 95% at the consolidated and bank levels, respectively, at year-end  2014. This more than exceeds the minimum phased-in requirement of 80%, which  became effective for Advanced Approach banks on Jan. 1, 2015.

1286,"   By Michael Flaherty | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Senator Richard Shelby attached his financial regulation relief bill to an appropriations markup on Wednesday, which passed a subcommittee vote, acting on a threat he issued previously if Democrats failed to offer a fair compromise.The Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015, which aims to ease bank regulations and enforce greater transparency on the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators, passed the Senate Banking Committee in May with no support from Democrats.During the bill's drafting, Shelby said he could move the proposal through the Senate's appropriations arm if Democrats were not willing to hash out support. Shelby acted on that threat on Wednesday.The bill, however, is unlikely to win the support from Democrats needed to bring it to a floor vote in the Senate. The biggest beneficiaries of the bill would be small U.S. lenders subject to greater regulation under the Dodd-Frank reform act. Large regional banks such as PNC Financial Services Group with assets between $50 billion to $500 billion would also benefit, as they may no longer be subject to stricter Fed regulations if the proposal is signed into law. The ball also proposes significant changes to the Federal Reserve system.With Democratic support yet to surface, President Barack Obama is highly unlikely to sign the bill should it ever get to the Senate floor for a vote. On Wednesday, Shelby attached his bill to a Senate Appropriations Subcommittee mark-up of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which won approval. Shelby's appropriations tactic could give the financial regulation relief bill a better chance of passage, even though the move has already irked Democrats who fear that it goes too far in weakening supervision of the banking industry.

1289,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed PNC Financial Services  Group, Inc.'s (PNC) ratings at 'A+/F1+'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The  affirmation reflects the strong earnings profile, stable and diverse business  model, and its consistency of performance through time.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects the company's strong earnings profile, stable and  diverse business model, and its consistency of performance through time. PNC's  earnings remain solid, and compare well with other large regional banks.  Earnings have benefited from diversified sources of non-interest income,  well-controlled core expenses and lower credit costs.  PNC's net interest margin (NIM) still benefits from purchase accounting  accretion (PAA), which added approximately 14 basis points (bps) to the margin  in the second quarter of 2015 (2Q15). Including the PAA, PNC's NIM still lags  many of its peers. Somewhat offsetting this dynamic, PNC generates a higher  relative proportion of earnings from non-interest income than the other large  regional banks. Noninterest income accounted for 46% of revenues in the first  half of 2015 (1H15), as compared to the peer average of 38%. PNC benefits from  asset management, corporate banking and consumer service fees, as well as its  22% ownership in BlackRock.  Noninterest income has also been aided by gains on the sale of the company's  Visa shares, which have averaged over $40 million a quarter over the last year,  or around 3% of quarterly pre-tax income. As of June 30, 2015, the unrealized  gain on PNC's Visa shares totaled roughly $600 million, providing the company  with the opportunity to likely sell down its holdings, and realize further  gains.  PNC's capital profile is considered solid, and roughly in line with other large  regional banks. PNC reported its estimated fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1  ratio (CET1) under Basel III standardized approach rules was 10% at June 30,  2015, well above the 7% threshold. Given its advanced-approach institution  status, it will face volatility in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)  due to interest rate movements, necessitating the need for an associated capital  buffer, which Fitch expects the company to maintain.   Although PNC is subject to the advanced approach, it will not be subject to  systemically important surcharge. Fitch also notes that PNC once again did well  under annual regulatory stress testing, with modest declines in starting and  ending capital ratios.  PNC's liquidity is good. At June 30, 2015, its loan to deposit ratio was 86%,  roughly in line with peers'. While Fitch expects this ratio could rise as loan  growth resumes to more normalized levels, we would expect PNC to manage its  liquidity position in a conservative manner, as it has historically done so. The  company also has access to a diversified array of funding sources. Fitch  believes PNC has sufficient sources of cash at the parent to maintain acceptable  levels of liquidity for the foreseeable future. PNC disclosed that its estimated pro forma liquidity coverage ratio was in  excess of 100% at both the consolidated and bank levels at quarter-end. This  more than exceeds the minimum phased-in requirement of 80%, which became  effective for Advanced Approach banks on Jan. 1, 2015.  The credit environment remains quite benign, and net charge-offs (NCOs)  decreased again, to only 13bps in 2Q15. Fitch notes that NCOs at this level are  unsustainable for the company and the industry. Given the commercial make-up of  PNC's loan portfolio, comprising 64% of loans, loan losses can be a bit lumpy  from quarter to quarter. However, PNC has historically reported lower loan  losses than peers, with less volatility when viewed over many years. This also  mitigates our concerns regarding PNC's relatively higher balance of  nonperforming assets (NPAs) than peers.  PNC has indicated that its through the cycle loss expectations are between 50bps  and 60bps. Given PNC's relatively stronger earnings profile, the company should  be able to provision at higher levels, without materially impacting earnings.  PNC exposure to the energy sector is very manageable. At June 30, 2015, PNC  reported $2.6 billion of oil and gas outstandings, which were down 10% from last  quarter. This represents less than 2% of total loans. PNC reported an increase  in commercial NPAs, but overall NPAs balances continue to improve.  Fitch views home equity reset risk as an industry concern. PNC has approximately  $4.1 billion of HELOCs (currently paying interest only) resetting to fully  amortizing loans in the next few years, potentially under a higher interest rate  environment. The performance of those borrowers that enter the repayment period  is significantly worse than those still in the draw period, with 3% of balances  30 to 89 days past due at June 30, 2015, and another 5% more than 90 days past  due, as compared to just 0.26% past due for the entire home equity portfolio.  While this warrants close monitoring, PNC's reserves and capital should be  sufficient to withstand higher levels of related delinquencies, losses and  modifications.  Fitch considers PNC's stake in BlackRock as providing an overall benefit to the  credit profile, since BlackRock's fees add an additional source of revenues to  the earnings mix. PNC may attempt to monetize some of its ownership in BlackRock  over time given the concentration risk that resides with such a large holding in  one company. At June 30, 2015, PNC had a significant unrecognized pre-tax gain  of $5.7 billion (excluding any liquidity discount or deferred tax liability).  BlackRock contributed 13% of consolidated income in 1H15, and provided nice  revenue diversification.  In June 2015, the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) terminated the mortgage  servicing consent order against PNC, which is viewed favorably, and  representative of PNC's sound risk management infrastructure. Some of PNC's  peers were deemed to not have met all the requirements yet.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES PNC's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a+' for loss  severity. PNC's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while PNC's trust  preferred securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two  times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria  and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk  profiles and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of PNC Bank, N.A. are rated one notch higher than  PNC's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  PNC's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of PNC Funding Corp are equalized with PNC's IDR reflecting  Fitch's view that it is core to PNC's business strategy and financial profile.  Fitch is withdrawing the ratings of National City Credit Corp. as the entity no  longer exists, and there is no outstanding debt.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR PNC has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, PNC is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.   RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT With a long-term IDR of 'A+', PNC remains one of the highest rated banks in the  world. There is currently a low likelihood that PNC's ratings would be upgraded  over the near term. However, over time, upwards ratings migration would be  predicated on a superior earnings profile relative to peers, maintenance of  capital at appropriate levels, and consistent through the cycle asset quality  measures.  Conversely, a meaningful deterioration in asset quality, coupled with weaker  profitability metrics, or more aggressive capital management could lead to a  negative rating action, although Fitch currently views a downgrade as unlikely.  PNC is more exposed to home equity reset risk than its peers. While Fitch's base  case is that deterioration in this portfolio will not lead to outsized losses,  PNC's ratings may be vulnerable under a more stressful scenario in which  reserves prove inadequate and its mitigation plans for addressing the end of  draws are not effective.  BlackRock's operations are relatively low risk, with little balance  sheet-related risk. That said, any strategic missteps or operational errors at  BlackRock could create earnings volatility on PNC's profit and loss statement  since this ownership typically accounts for more than 10% of consolidated  earnings. A complete divestiture of its ownership of BlackRock would be  evaluated for any rating implications depending on the intended use of the  proceeds, and plans to generate the foregone recurring revenues. However, Fitch  views PNC's ability to fully monetize its ownership as limited, at least in the  near term, though we expect some incremental sales may occur.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for PNC and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to PNC's VR.     LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to PNC's  long-and short-term IDR.   HOLDING COMPANY  Should PNC's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of PNC to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in PNC's IDRs.  To the extent that one of PNC's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from PNC's IDR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since PNC's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.   FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: PNC Financial Services Group Inc. --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a+'; --Support at '5'; --Support floor at 'NF'; --Senior unsecured at 'A+'; --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Subordinated at 'A'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB-'.

1290,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 23 (Fitch) (This is a correction of a release published Oct. 5,  2015.  It corrects the short-term rating for PNC to 'F1' in the first sentence,  which was stated as 'F1+' in the original release.) Fitch Ratings has affirmed PNC Financial Services Group, Inc.'s (PNC) ratings at  'A+/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The affirmation reflects the strong  earnings profile, stable and diverse business model, and its consistency of  performance through time.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares  Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding  Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial  Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo &  Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRs, VRs, AND SENIOR DEBT The affirmation reflects the company's strong earnings profile, stable and  diverse business model, and its consistency of performance through time. PNC's  earnings remain solid, and compare well with other large regional banks.  Earnings have benefited from diversified sources of non-interest income,  well-controlled core expenses and lower credit costs.  PNC's net interest margin (NIM) still benefits from purchase accounting  accretion (PAA), which added approximately 14 basis points (bps) to the margin  in the second quarter of 2015 (2Q15). Including the PAA, PNC's NIM still lags  many of its peers. Somewhat offsetting this dynamic, PNC generates a higher  relative proportion of earnings from non-interest income than the other large  regional banks. Noninterest income accounted for 46% of revenues in the first  half of 2015 (1H15), as compared to the peer average of 38%. PNC benefits from  asset management, corporate banking and consumer service fees, as well as its  22% ownership in BlackRock.  Noninterest income has also been aided by gains on the sale of the company's  Visa shares, which have averaged over $40 million a quarter over the last year,  or around 3% of quarterly pre-tax income. As of June 30, 2015, the unrealized  gain on PNC's Visa shares totaled roughly $600 million, providing the company  with the opportunity to likely sell down its holdings, and realize further  gains.  PNC's capital profile is considered solid, and roughly in line with other large  regional banks. PNC reported its estimated fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1  ratio (CET1) under Basel III standardized approach rules was 10% at June 30,  2015, well above the 7% threshold. Given its advanced-approach institution  status, it will face volatility in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI)  due to interest rate movements, necessitating the need for an associated capital  buffer, which Fitch expects the company to maintain.  Although PNC is subject to the advanced approach, it will not be subject to  systemically important surcharge. Fitch also notes that PNC once again did well  under annual regulatory stress testing, with modest declines in starting and  ending capital ratios.  PNC's liquidity is good. At June 30, 2015, its loan to deposit ratio was 86%,  roughly in line with peers'. While Fitch expects this ratio could rise as loan  growth resumes to more normalized levels, we would expect PNC to manage its  liquidity position in a conservative manner, as it has historically done so. The  company also has access to a diversified array of funding sources. Fitch  believes PNC has sufficient sources of cash at the parent to maintain acceptable  levels of liquidity for the foreseeable future.  PNC disclosed that its estimated pro forma liquidity coverage ratio was in  excess of 100% at both the consolidated and bank levels at quarter-end. This  more than exceeds the minimum phased-in requirement of 80%, which became  effective for Advanced Approach banks on Jan. 1, 2015.  The credit environment remains quite benign, and net charge-offs (NCOs)  decreased again, to only 13bps in 2Q15. Fitch notes that NCOs at this level are  unsustainable for the company and the industry. Given the commercial make-up of  PNC's loan portfolio, comprising 64% of loans, loan losses can be a bit lumpy  from quarter to quarter. However, PNC has historically reported lower loan  losses than peers, with less volatility when viewed over many years. This also  mitigates our concerns regarding PNC's relatively higher balance of  nonperforming assets (NPAs) than peers.  PNC has indicated that its through the cycle loss expectations are between 50bps  and 60bps. Given PNC's relatively stronger earnings profile, the company should  be able to provision at higher levels, without materially impacting earnings.  PNC exposure to the energy sector is very manageable. At June 30, 2015, PNC  reported $2.6 billion of oil and gas outstandings, which were down 10% from last  quarter. This represents less than 2% of total loans. PNC reported an increase  in commercial NPAs, but overall NPAs balances continue to improve.  Fitch views home equity reset risk as an industry concern. PNC has approximately  $4.1 billion of HELOCs (currently paying interest only) resetting to fully  amortizing loans in the next few years, potentially under a higher interest rate  environment. The performance of those borrowers that enter the repayment period  is significantly worse than those still in the draw period, with 3% of balances  30 to 89 days past due at June 30, 2015, and another 5% more than 90 days past  due, as compared to just 0.26% past due for the entire home equity portfolio.  While this warrants close monitoring, PNC's reserves and capital should be  sufficient to withstand higher levels of related delinquencies, losses and  modifications.  Fitch considers PNC's stake in BlackRock as providing an overall benefit to the  credit profile, since BlackRock's fees add an additional source of revenues to  the earnings mix. PNC may attempt to monetize some of its ownership in BlackRock  over time given the concentration risk that resides with such a large holding in  one company. At June 30, 2015, PNC had a significant unrecognized pre-tax gain  of $5.7 billion (excluding any liquidity discount or deferred tax liability).  BlackRock contributed 13% of consolidated income in 1H15, and provided nice  revenue diversification.  In June 2015, the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) terminated the mortgage  servicing consent order against PNC, which is viewed favorably, and  representative of PNC's sound risk management infrastructure. Some of PNC's  peers were deemed to not have met all the requirements yet. SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES PNC's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR of 'a+' for loss  severity. PNC's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times  for loss severity and three times for non-performance, while PNC's trust  preferred securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two  times for non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria  and assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk  profiles and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of PNC Bank, N.A. are rated one notch higher than  PNC's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default. HOLDING COMPANY  PNC's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities. SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY The IDRs and VRs of PNC Funding Corp are equalized with PNC's IDR reflecting  Fitch's view that it is core to PNC's business strategy and financial profile.  Fitch is withdrawing the ratings of National City Credit Corp. as the entity no  longer exists, and there is no outstanding debt. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR PNC has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, PNC is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support. RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT With a long-term IDR of 'A+', PNC remains one of the highest rated banks in the  world. There is currently a low likelihood that PNC's ratings would be upgraded  over the near term. However, over time, upwards ratings migration would be  predicated on a superior earnings profile relative to peers, maintenance of  capital at appropriate levels, and consistent through the cycle asset quality  measures.  Conversely, a meaningful deterioration in asset quality, coupled with weaker  profitability metrics, or more aggressive capital management could lead to a  negative rating action, although Fitch currently views a downgrade as unlikely.  PNC is more exposed to home equity reset risk than its peers. While Fitch's base  case is that deterioration in this portfolio will not lead to outsized losses,  PNC's ratings may be vulnerable under a more stressful scenario in which  reserves prove inadequate and its mitigation plans for addressing the end of  draws are not effective.  BlackRock's operations are relatively low risk, with little balance  sheet-related risk. That said, any strategic missteps or operational errors at  BlackRock could create earnings volatility on PNC's profit and loss statement  since this ownership typically accounts for more than 10% of consolidated  earnings. A complete divestiture of its ownership of BlackRock would be  evaluated for any rating implications depending on the intended use of the  proceeds, and plans to generate the foregone recurring revenues. However, Fitch  views PNC's ability to fully monetize its ownership as limited, at least in the  near term, though we expect some incremental sales may occur.   SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for PNC and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to PNC's VR. LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to PNC's  long-and short-term IDR. HOLDING COMPANY  Should PNC's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies. RATING SENSITIVITIES - SUBSIDIARY AND AFFILIATED COMPANY  As the IDRs and VRs of the subsidiaries are equalized with those of PNC to  reflect support from their ultimate parent, they are sensitive to changes in the  parent's propensity to provide support, which Fitch currently does not expect,  or from changes in PNC's IDRs.  To the extent that one of PNC's subsidiary or affiliated companies is not  considered to be a core business, Fitch could also notch the subsidiary's rating  from PNC's IDR. SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since PNC's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future. The rating actions are as follows:  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  PNC Financial Services Group Inc.  --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1';  --Viability at 'a+';  --Support at '5';  --Support floor at 'NF';  --Senior unsecured at 'A+';  --Short-term debt at 'F1';  --Subordinated at 'A';  --Preferred stock at 'BBB-'.

1291,"   By Dena Aubin  Dec 3 - PNC Bank has asked a federal appeals court to overturn a $289 million judgment awarded for the bank's alleged role in a multistate fraud involving prepaid funeral contracts. The notice of appeal, filed on Wednesday with the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, came after a federal court in St. Louis, Missouri, last month denied PNC's motion for a new trial, rejecting the bank's argument that the jury was prejudiced by several errors made by the court.

1294,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, July 15 (Fitch) PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC) reported $989  million in net income for 2Q16, up 5% on a linked-quarter basis, for an ROA of  1.11%. On a year-over-year basis, net income fell 5.3%. The results are in line  with Fitch Ratings' expectations for the company, which remains very highly  rated. Results reflected strong fee income growth during the quarter and lower  credit costs, partially offset by higher noninterest expenses and margin  compression.  PNC reported strong fee income growth, up 16% on a linked-quarter basis, from  higher client activity and seasonality. This is in line with PNC's prior  guidance of an increase between 10% and 12%. There were broad-based improvements  across all categories. PNC reported higher M&A advisory fees, securities  underwriting activity, loan syndication fees, mortgage banking and  payment-related fees. PNC also reported $51 million in negative valuation  adjustments primarily associated with private equity investments under the  Volcker Rule. The company has indicated it will continue to wind down its  portfolio of nonconforming investments as the Volker Rules goes into full effect  in July 2017.  The provision for loan losses declined 16% reflecting lower-energy-related  provisioning. PNC reported some improvement in problem asset levels and  consolidated lower loan losses. NCOs during the quarter remained low at 26bps  during the quarter. Fitch expects loan losses for PNC and the industry will  deteriorate from unsustainably low levels.  Non-interest expenses increased approximately 3.5% on a linked-quarter basis due  to higher variable compensation costs, which were partially offset by the  release of residential mortgage foreclosure-related reserves of $24 million in  2Q16. PNC continues to invest in technology and business infrastructure, and  disclosed that approximately 18% of the branch network now operates under the  universal model, as part of PNC's retail branch transformation strategy.  Spread income declined slightly due to a decline in purchase accounting  accretion, as well as lower core net interest income. Lower securities yields  and higher borrowing costs were partially offset by higher loan balances. The  net interest margin (NIM) declined 5bps to 2.70% during the quarter, while the  core NIM, excluding purchase accounting accretion, declined 2bps to 2.63%.  Loan growth was modest during the quarter at just 1%, with growth in large  corporate and real estate loans offset by lower home equity and education  balances. Compared to 2Q15, total loan growth was modest as well due to the  company's declining consumer exposure. PNC grew its commercial real estate  balances by a significant 16.3% over the last year, mainly in permanent lending  given continuing disruptions in the CMBS market. PNC reported some further deterioration in the energy portfolio. However,  energy-related provisions were $48 million during 2Q16, as compared to $80  million last quarter, while non-performing loan balances were fairly stable at  $293 million or 10% of outstanding related loans. PNC's exposure to the energy  sector is on the lower end of the large bank universe. At June 30, 2016, PNC  reported $2.7 billion of oil and gas outstandings, or less than 2% of total  loans.  PNC reported its estimated fully phased-in Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1)  under Basel III standardized approach rules was a solid 10.2%, up roughly 10bps  from the prior quarter. PNC received no objection to its capital plan under  CCAR, which included an 8% increase in the common dividend to $0.55 a share, and  $2 billion in share repurchases.  PNC also disclosed that its estimated pro forma Liquidity Coverage Ratio was in  excess of 100% at both the consolidated and bank levels at quarter-end, above  the phased-in requirement of 90% on Jan. 1, 2016.

1298,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed PNC Financial Services  Group, Inc.'s (PNC) ratings at 'A+/F1'. The Rating Outlook remains Stable. The  affirmation reflects PNC's strong earnings profile, stable and diverse business  model, and its consistent performance through time.  The rating action follows a periodic review of the large regional banking group,  which includes BB&T Corporation (BBT), Capital One Finance Corporation (COF),  Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (CFG), Comerica Incorporated (CMA), Fifth Third  Bancorp (FITB), Huntington Bancshares Inc. (HBAN), Keycorp (KEY), M&T Bank  Corporation (MTB), MUFG Americas Holding Corporation (MUAH), PNC Financial  Services Group (PNC), Regions Financial Corporation (RF), SunTrust Banks Inc.  (STI), US Bancorp (USB), Wells Fargo & Company (WFC), and Zions Bancorporation  (ZION).  Company-specific rating rationales for the other banks are published separately,  and for further discussion of the large regional bank sector in general, refer  to the special report titled 'Large Regional Bank Periodic Review,' to be  published shortly.  KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS, VRs AND SENIOR DEBT PNC's rating affirmation reflects the company's strong earnings profile, stable  and diverse business model, and its consistent performance through time. PNC's  earnings remain solid and compare well with other large regional banks. Earnings  have benefited from diversified sources of non-interest income, well-controlled  core expenses and lower credit costs.  Fitch also views PNC's company profile as strong, buttressed by its solid  deposit market shares, as well as diverse business model, with particular  strengths in corporate banking, middle-market M&A advisory, and wealth  management. Fitch characterizes PNC's risk appetite as generally superior to most large  regional banks. The stability of PNC's results through the cycle is a useful  indicator of risk appetite. PNC has both an earnings profile and asset quality  performance that have outperformed peers and also demonstrated less volatility  over the past 10 years. This is an important rating consideration and lends  support to these institutions' higher ratings. PNC's capital profile is considered appropriate, particularly in light of its  risk profile. PNC has been one of the most consistent banks in the U.S., both  from an earnings standpoint and PNC's historical loan losses. At June 30, 2016,  PNC's transitional CET1 was 10.64%, slightly below the peer median. PNC has yet  to exit parallel run, but it is anticipated the standardized approach will  remain the binding constraint. Given its advanced-approach institution status,  it will face volatility in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) due to  interest rate movements, necessitating the need for an associated capital  buffer, which Fitch expects the company to maintain. PNC has yet to publicly  state a CET1 target number, though Fitch expects the large regional banks to  have long-term targets of between 8% and 9.5%.  PNC's liquidity remains good. At June 30, 2016, its loan to deposit ratio was  84%, one of the lowest in the peer group. While this ratio could rise as loan  growth resumes to more normalized levels, Fitch would expect PNC to manage its  liquidity position in a conservative manner, as it has historically done so. The  company also has access to a diversified array of funding sources.  PNC disclosed that its estimated pro forma Liquidity Coverage Ratio was in  excess of 100% at both the consolidated and bank levels at quarter-end. This  more than exceeds the minimum phased-in requirement of 90%, which became  effective for Advanced Approach banks on Jan. 1, 2016.  Holding company coverage is also considered solid with approximately $4.8  billion in cash and short-term investments at the parent to cover $1.9 billion  in maturities over the next 12 months, as well as ongoing interest expenses,  common dividends, and preferred dividends. This does not even include $1.3  billion in bank dividend capacity. PNC continues to have good access to the  capital markets.  The credit environment remains quite benign, with just 27bps of loan losses in  1H16. Given the commercial make-up of PNC's loan portfolio, comprising 66% of  loans, loan losses can be a bit lumpy from quarter to quarter. However, PNC has  historically reported lower loan losses than peers, with less volatility when  viewed over many years.  Over the past 12 months, PNC has reported relatively modest loan growth both in  absolute and relative terms. The loan mix has shifted somewhat over the past two  years to a greater percentage of lower-yielding, but also lower loss content  commercial loans, as PNC shrinks its home equity and education portfolios. PNC  disclosed in public commentary last year how competitive lending particularly in  the C&I space had become, prompting the company to slow lending in this area.  The bank has grown C&I loans by just 2% over the past 12 months, as compared to  the peer average of 8%. Given Fitch's concerns regarding competition  particularly in C&I lending since the financial crisis, this is viewed as  prudent.  However, CRE lending has been relatively robust over the past year. PNC  disclosed that it grew commercial real estate balances by a significant 16% over  the last year alone, mainly in permanent lending given continuing disruptions in  the CMBS market. Fitch expects that the inherent credit risk in this newly  originated book of loans will be acceptable given PNC's historical track record  and sound underwriting practices. Nonetheless, Fitch will monitor this growth  for any deterioration upon further loan seasoning.  PNC exposure to the energy sector is on the lower end of the large bank  universe. At June 30, 2016, PNC reported $2.7 billion of oil and gas  outstandings and around $0.5 billion of coal outstanding balances, or combined  roughly 1.5% of total loans. PNC reported some further deterioration in the  energy portfolio in 2Q16. However, it is anticipated that any related loan  losses will present an earnings headwind, and not erode capital. PNC has approximately $3.3 billion of HELOCs (currently paying interest only)  resetting to fully amortizing loans in the next few years. The performance of  those borrowers that enter the repayment period is significantly worse than  those still in the draw period, with 3% of balances 30 to 89 days past due at  June 30, 2016, and another 5% more than 90 days past due, as compared to just  0.29% past due for the entire home equity portfolio. While this warrants close  monitoring, PNC's reserves and capital should be sufficient to withstand higher  levels of related delinquencies, losses and modifications. Further, home equity  loan losses remain very low, at just 24bps in 1H16, also an improvement from  last year.  Fitch considers PNC's stake in BlackRock as providing an overall benefit to the  credit profile, since BlackRock's fees add an additional source of revenues to  the earnings mix. PNC has been looking to monetize its ownership in BlackRock in  a tax efficient manner given the concentration risk that resides with such a  large holding in one company, but to this point, has been unable to find  anything that has been executable. At June 30, 2016, PNC had a significant  unrecognized pre-tax gain of $5.3 billion (excluding any liquidity discount or  deferred tax liability). BlackRock contributed 13% of consolidated income in  1H16 and provided revenue diversification.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES PNC's subordinated debt is notched one level below its VR for loss severity.  PNC's preferred stock is notched five levels below its VR, two times for loss  severity and three times for non-performance, while PNC's trust preferred  securities are notched two times from the VR for loss severity and two times for  non-performance. These ratings are in accordance with Fitch's criteria and  assessment of the instruments non-performance and loss severity risk profiles  and have thus been affirmed due to the affirmation of the VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The uninsured deposit ratings of PNC Bank, N.A. are rated one notch higher than  PNC's IDR and senior unsecured debt because U.S. uninsured deposits benefit from  depositor preference. U.S. depositor preference gives deposit liabilities  superior recovery prospects in the event of default.  HOLDING COMPANY  PNC's IDR and VR are equalized with those of its operating companies and bank,  reflecting its role as the bank holding company, which is mandated in the U.S.  to act as a source of strength for its bank subsidiaries. Ratings are also  equalized reflecting the very close correlation between holding company and  subsidiary failure and default probabilities.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR PNC has a Support Rating of '5' and Support Rating Floor of 'NF'. In Fitch's  view, PNC is not systemically important and therefore, the probability of  support is unlikely. IDRs and VRs do not incorporate any support.  RATING SENSITIVITIES VR, IDRs, AND SENIOR DEBT With a long-term IDR of 'A+', PNC remains one of the highest rated banks in the  world. There is currently a low likelihood that PNC's ratings would be upgraded  over the near term. However, over time, upwards ratings migration would be  predicated on a superior earnings profile relative to peers, maintenance of  capital at appropriate levels, and consistent through the cycle asset quality  measures.  Conversely, a meaningful deterioration in asset quality, coupled with weaker  profitability metrics, or more aggressive capital management could lead to a  negative rating action, although Fitch currently views a downgrade as unlikely.  BlackRock's operations are relatively low risk, with little balance  sheet-related risk. However, any strategic missteps or operational errors at  BlackRock could create earnings volatility on PNC's profit and loss statement  since this ownership typically accounts for more than 10% of consolidated  earnings. A complete divestiture of its ownership of BlackRock would be  evaluated for any rating implications depending on the intended use of the  proceeds and plans to generate the foregone recurring revenues. However, Fitch  views PNC's ability to fully monetize its ownership as limited, at least in the  near term, but expects some incremental sales may occur.  Based on public commentary PNC has made regarding the regulatory environment,  Fitch does not expect PNC to be an active acquirer over the near term. Rather,  Fitch expects PNC to continue to execute on its strategy in the Southeast  markets, Chicago, and St. Louis, with initiatives to improve penetration and  growth in these markets. Any sizeable acquisition would be evaluated for any  rating implications.  SUBORDINATED DEBT AND OTHER HYBRID SECURITIES The ratings for PNC and its operating companies' subordinated debt and preferred  stock are sensitive to any change to PNC's VR.  LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEPOSIT RATINGS The long- and short-term deposit ratings are sensitive to any change to PNC's  long-and short-term IDR.  HOLDING COMPANY  Should PNC's holding company begin to exhibit signs of weakness, demonstrate  trouble accessing the capital markets, or have inadequate cash flow coverage to  meet near-term obligations, there is the potential that Fitch could notch the  holding company IDR and VR from the ratings of the operating companies.  SUPPORT RATING AND SUPPORT RATING FLOOR Since PNC's Support and Support Rating Floors are '5' and 'NF', respectively,  there is limited likelihood that these ratings will change over the foreseeable  future.  Fitch has affirmed the following ratings: PNC Financial Services Group Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A+'; Outlook Stable; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --Viability at 'a+'; --Support at '5'; --Support floor at 'NF'; --Senior unsecured at 'A+'; --Short-term debt at 'F1'; --Subordinated at 'A'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB-'.

1305,"   By Junko Fujita | TOKYO  TOKYO Japan's Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T) is in final talks to buy the building rented by luxury retailer Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) for its flagship store in Tokyo's posh Omotesando area for about 35 billion yen ($342 million), three people with knowledge of the deal said.The purchase by Mitsubishi, Japan's biggest trading firm by net income, will be the largest property transaction since a group of investors bought an office building in Tokyo for about 100 billion yen last August. The price represents a premium of about 13 percent on that paid the last time the building changed hands, four years ago.The deal for the four-storey building occupied by the New York brand in the center of one of Tokyo's most fashionable districts comes as hopes grow among real estate operators that retail rents in general are set to rise amid growing interest in opening stores in the city.As part of his efforts to bring sustained growth to the world's third-biggest economy, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has promoted monetary, fiscal and structural reforms - dubbed ""Abenomics"" - that are stoking retail sales, fueling demand for store space in the capital's sprawl of shopping districts.Mitsubishi, with an array of businesses in finance, machinery, chemicals and energy, is aiming to buy the building from a group comprising Japanese property investor Secured Capital Investment Management, financial services company Orix Corp (8591.T) and Honolulu-based Trinity Investments.The current owners paid 31 billion yen for the eight-year-old, 7,421 square-meter property in 2010 when the market slowed in the wake of the global financial crisis. Japan's property business began to rebound last year, boosted by Prime Minister Abe's pro-growth economic policies. Also present on Omotesando are stores operated by the biggest names in the luxury goods business, including LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA's (LVMH.PA) Bulgari, Celine and Vuitton brands, Kering SA's (PRTP.PA) Gucci and privately owned Chanel.Both domestic and overseas retailers have ambitions to open stores in primary Tokyo shopping districts like Omotesando and the central Ginza area, said Hajime Shibata, a senior consultant at the Japanese unit of global commercial real estate service firm CBRE.The Mitsubishi deal will follow the acquisition of another landmark Tokyo retail property, a building housing a Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) store in Ginza. It was bought by Masayoshi Son, the billionaire founder of tech and telecoms group Softbank Corp (9984.T), for 32 billion yen in September. Shibata said Omotesando remains a draw for retailers because the area attracts fashion-conscious shoppers. While Omotesando offers an array of upscale stores, it's also located close to Harajuku, an area popular with younger buyers of Tokyo's funky street styles.""The market for retail properties in Tokyo has a positive outlook and we can expect the rents will start increasing,"" said Shibata.Low-cost financing will also fuel property deals. ""Investors will remain aggressive this year because they can continue borrowing money cheaply,"" said Takashi Ishizawa, chief real estate analyst at Mizuho Securities Co.A Mitsubishi spokeswoman declined to comment on the transaction. Officials for the current owners also declined to comment. Ralph Lauren was not immediately available for comment.Mitsubishi already has a substantial presence in Japan's property markets with its real estate asset management firm Diamond Realty Management Inc, which operates a private real estate trust.

1313,"  Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) warned on Friday that its efforts to open more stores would erode operating profit margin at the luxury fashion house in the fiscal year through March 2015, and that sales growth would also be slower.The company's shares fell 6.7 percent to $142 in premarket trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Ralph Lauren, whose brands include Club Monaco stores, Chaps and its namesake brands, gets about 54 percent of its sales through department stores such as Macy's Inc (M.N) and other retailers. But in recent years, it has been opening more stores to have more control over the brands.The company plans to spend $400 million to $500 million on capital projects in the new fiscal year, and expects operating profit margin to fall between 0.75 and 1.25 percentage points as a result. In comparison, Macy's plans to spend about $1 billion but is about four times larger in terms of revenue.The push comes amid tepid sales in its retail business. Sales at its own stores open at least a year fell 1 percent in the fourth quarter ended March 29, while wholesale revenue jumped 24 percent, lifted by big gains in the Americas. Ralph Lauren projects global revenues will rise between 6 percent and 8 percent, a slower pace of growth than the 9 percent increase in the year through March 2014.

1329,"   By Tom Brown | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Ralph Lauren Corp lost some ground on Wednesday in its long-running trademark fight with the United States Polo Association over the use of its logo depicting a horse-mounted polo player swinging a mallet.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled that the Polo Association cannot be held in contempt for selling sunglasses with a logo similar to the one emblazoned with the horseman, which is featured on clothing and accessories sold under the Polo Ralph Lauren brand trademark around the globe.The association is the governing body of polo in the United States. But in a partnership with JRA Trademark Co, it also markets certain consumer goods, often in competition with Polo Ralph Lauren. The logo in dispute in the case is known as the ""double horsemen mark"" and depicts two mounted polo players vying for a ball.The Polo Association sold nearly one million pairs of sunglasses bearing the mark between 2009 and 2012, when a lower court judge ruled that it could be held in contempt  for violating an injunction against such use dating back to 1984. Wednesday's ruling, written by 2nd Circuit Judge Ralph Winter, said the injunction barred the Polo Association from using the double-horseman mark and the word ""polo"" on its fragrances and beauty products, among other merchandise.But it said the injunction, which fell short of being clear and unambiguous, did not bar use of the double horsemen mark across all markets. ""The parties bound by an injunction are entitled to clear notice of what specifically they may or may not do,"" it said.""USPA (United States Polo Association) argues that the underlying injunction did not enjoin all uses of the mark.

1330,"  NEW YORK Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) lost some ground on Wednesday in its long-running trademark fight with the United States Polo Association over the use of its logo depicting a horse-mounted polo player swinging a mallet.The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan ruled that the Polo Association cannot be held in contempt for selling sunglasses with a logo similar to the one emblazoned with the horseman, which is featured on clothing and accessories sold under the Polo Ralph Lauren brand trademark around the globe.The association is the governing body of polo in the United States. But in a partnership with JRA Trademark Co, it also markets certain consumer goods, often in competition with Polo Ralph Lauren.The logo in dispute in the case is known as the ""double horsemen mark"" and depicts two mounted polo players vying for aball. The Polo Association sold nearly one million pairs of sunglasses bearing the mark between 2009 and 2012, when a lower court judge ruled that it could be held in contempt for violating an injunction against such use dating back to 1984.Wednesday's ruling, written by 2nd Circuit Judge Ralph Winter, said the injunction barred the Polo Association from using the double-horseman mark and the word ""polo"" on its fragrances and beauty products, among other merchandise. But it said the injunction, which fell short of being clear and unambiguous, did not bar use of the double horsemen mark across all markets.""The parties bound by an injunction are entitled to clear notice of what specifically they may or may not do,"" it said.

Lauren will continue to serve as executive chairman and head its design team, the company said in a statement.  Lauren, who got his start designing neckties, plans to stay active at the company and Larsson will report to him. “When they start designing things I can’t understand, I’ll quit,” Lauren told the New York Times in an interview. Ralph Lauren shares rose 3.79 percent to $108 in trading after the bell on the news. The company has been struggling to boost profits as a stronger dollar reduces the value of sales from overseas. Net revenue in its first quarter ended June 27 fell 5 percent, mainly due to currency effects.  Odeon Capital analyst Rick Snyder said the company had grown to a size where it needed more ""systems and controls."" The change in CEO ""is just a natural progression,"" Snyder said.Milton Pedraza, a fashion industry analyst at the Luxury Institute, said Larsson’s appointment follows a trend of luxury brands hiring leaders from mass-market companies in recent months. He cited the appointment of Grita Loebsack, a former vice president at Unilever Plc, as CEO of Kering's emerging brands, which include Stella McCartney and Gucci. Larsson is credited with reviving sales at the Old Navy division, successfully implementing a model of offering trendy clothes at low prices.Annual sales at the business rose 8 percent in 2014 and became Gap's biggest business. Sales for the division were $6.62 billion, or 40.3 percent of Gap's total. Lauren's fashion empire includes some 25 brands including the Polo, Club Monaco and Denim & Supply, and the company makes clothing, accessories, furniture, home decor items and footwear under its labels.   FROM WILD WEST TO HIP HOP   Despite the aura of Anglo-Saxon elitism around his company, Lauren was born Ralph Lifshitz in the Bronx in 1939. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Belarus, and he changed his name to Lauren at age 16.  Despite his humble roots, Lauren's designs drew inspiration from elite and exotic realms including East Coast prepsters, the Wild West, colonists on African safari and czarist Russia. He designed the wardrobe for the 1974 film version of ""The Great Gatsby"" including a pink suit for star Robert Redford.  The Ralph Lauren Polo shirt, which debuted in 1972, became a signature item for the company with a tiny polo player embroidered on the chest. His designs have been worn by presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, actress Gwyneth Paltrow and actor Johnny Depp.Lauren was also, perhaps surprisingly, influential in the hip hop world. His bright colors and bold clothing became staples for some New York gangs, and rappers such as Kanye West and Lil Wayne have mentioned Lauren and his designs in their rhymes.

1342,"  (Adds details on Larsson's experience, analyst quote, Gap shares)By Siddharth Cavale and Kylie GumpertNEW YORK, Sept 29 American designer Ralph Lauren, who built a fashion powerhouse on luxury designs inspired by country club chic, announced Tuesday he is stepping down as chief executive officer and named the head of Gap Inc's  populist Old Navy brand to the position.Ralph Lauren Corp, founded by 75-year-old Lauren in 1967, appointed Stefan Larsson, the global president of Gap's Old Navy division, as CEO effective in November. Lauren will continue to serve as executive chairman and head its design team, the company said in a statement.Lauren, who got his start designing neckties, plans to stay active at the company and Larsson will report to him.""When they start designing things I can't understand, I'll quit,"" Lauren told the New York Times in an interview.Ralph Lauren shares rose 3.79 percent to $108 in trading after the bell. Gap shares fell 3 percent to $29.30.The company has been struggling to boost profits as a stronger dollar reduces the value of sales from overseas. Net revenue in its first quarter ended June 27 fell 5 percent, mainly due to currency fluctuations.Odeon Capital analyst Rick Snyder said the company had grown to a size where it needed more ""systems and controls."" The change in CEO ""is just a natural progression,"" Snyder said. Milton Pedraza, a fashion industry analyst at the Luxury Institute, said Larsson's appointment follows a trend of luxury brands hiring leaders from mass-market companies in recent months. He cited the appointment of Grita Loebsack, a former vice president at Unilever Plc, as CEO of Kering's  emerging brands, which include Stella McCartney and Gucci.Larsson, 41, is credited with reviving sales at Old Navy, successfully implementing a model of offering trendy clothes at low prices.Annual sales at the division rose 8 percent in 2014 and became Gap's biggest business. Sales for the division were $6.62 billion, or 40.3 percent of Gap's total.Lauren's fashion empire includes some 25 brands including Polo, Club Monaco and Denim & Supply, and the company makes clothing, accessories, furniture, home decor items and footwear under its labels. Larsson, a Swede who before joining Gap was global head of sales at Hennes & Mauritz, brings experience of managing a fast fashion business with a supply chains considered to be among the most efficient within the apparel industry.His appointment would be a good fit for Ralph Lauren which is seeking to reorganize and centralize business units and brands, Snyder said.""If he comes from a place like H&M, he understands global supply chains and that's one of the things that Ralph Lauren is trying to implement right now,"" Snyder said. ""It's going to be very positive for them."" FROM WILD WEST TO HIP HOP Despite the aura of Anglo-Saxon elitism around his company, Lauren was born Ralph Lifshitz in the Bronx in 1939. His parents were Jewish immigrants from Belarus, and he changed his name to Lauren at age 16.Lauren's designs drew inspiration from elite and exotic realms including East Coast prepsters, the Wild West, colonists on African safari and czarist Russia. He designed the wardrobe for the 1974 film version of ""The Great Gatsby"" including a pink suit for star Robert Redford.The Ralph Lauren Polo shirt, which debuted in 1972, became a signature item for the company with a tiny polo player embroidered on the chest.His designs have been worn by presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, actress Gwyneth Paltrow and actor Johnny Depp.Lauren was also, perhaps surprisingly, influential in the hip hop world. His bright colors and bold clothing became staples for some New York gangs, and rappers such as Kanye West and Lil Wayne have mentioned Lauren and his designs in their rhymes.The company also said that Jackwyn Nemerov, chief operating officer, would retire in November at which time she will become an adviser to the company.(Reporting by Sneha Banerjee and Ramkumar Iyer in Bengaluru and Siddharth Cavale and Kylie Gumpert in New York; Additional reporting by Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and Lisa Shumaker)",2015-09-30,RL,"Tue Sep 29, 2015 | 8:46pm EDT",UPDATE 3-Ralph Lauren hires Old Navy exec to replace him as CEO,http://www.reuters.com//article/ralph-lauren-ceo-idUSL1N11Z31920150930?type=companyNews,0.9957,0.01,0.888,0.101
1343,"   By Tom Hals | WILMINGTON, Del  WILMINGTON, Del Oct 22 First Data Corp's Chief Executive Officer Frank Bisignano hailed a $3.5 billion fund-raising in July 2014 for drawing a ""who's who in equity investing"" and paving the way for the payment processor's huge IPO last week.The 2014 deal included one unusual investor: Lehman Brothers, the bank that collapsed in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis.Lehman may be long gone from Wall Street, but its bankruptcy estate still manages a portfolio of more than $10 billion in assets, exceeding the market capitalization of fashion house Ralph Lauren Corp or property investment firm Kimco Realty Corp.From an office in Manhattan, Lehman's staff manage piles of cash and securities, interests in real estate and private equity investments, including a stake in Formula One motor racing.While bankruptcy estates focus on liquidating assets for the benefit of creditors, Lehman dusted off its investing expertise last year and spent $151 million on private placement of stock in First Data.According to a court filing, the money was spent on a ""pro-rata"" share of the private placement, indicating Lehman had a previous relationship with First Data. Lehman provided financing in 2007 for the buyout of First Data, which was led by KKR & Co.""When you get a $3.5 billion vote of confidence by some fabulous investors,"" Bisignano told an analysts call in July 2014, ""the who's who in equity investing in it gives your customers great confidence in your ability."" The private placement of stock was credited by Bisignano for providing cash to pay down First Data's debt and returning the company to profit after years of losses.Lehman's management can make investments if they determine it will likely benefit creditors.Lehman and First Data declined to comment on the Lehman stake.Lehman did not disclose how the First Data investment performed. KKR, which was the lead investor in the 2014 private placement, has estimated in securities filings the value of its investment in First Data rose about 13 percent from the private placement through June 30. However, those gains may have been offset after First Data cut the IPO price by 20 percent from the top of its target range.Shares in First Data were little changed at $15.36 on Thursday, below the $16 IPO price.COMPLEX CASES  Lehman emerged from bankruptcy in 2012 with a new board selected by creditors, overseen by Chairman David Pauker, formerly the executive managing director of Goldin Associates, a financial consultancy. Christopher O'Meara, a former chief financial officer of Lehman, is the chief executive.""I do think it's remarkable both how significant Lehman's assets have turned out to be and how much they still have,"" said David Skeel, a professor at University of Pennsylvania Law School.The First Data deal is not even the largest investment by the bankrupt firm. In 2012, it ponied up about $3 billion to buy two minority positions held by other banks in Archstone, an owner of apartment complexes, giving it full ownership. It later sold Archstone for $6.5 billion.Lehman had teamed up with Tishman Speyer to acquire Archstone for $22.2 billion, including debt, in 2007.In total, Lehman's bankruptcy estate has distributed $105.4 billion to creditors. Of that, $77.2 billion was paid to third-party claims, with the rest paid to other Lehman affiliates. While more than $1 trillion of claims were filed, the estate will recognize about $330 billion, according to court documents.Jonathan Lipson, a professor at Temple University School of Law, said the case could still require years of work as the estate pursues lingering litigation and awaits overseas affiliates to complete their liquidations.""Enron's estate lasted forever and ever,"" Lipson said, referring to the power company that filed in 2001 and closed its bankruptcy case only last year. ""That's what happens with really complex cases.""

1347,"   By Melissa Fares and Gina Cherelus | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Michael Kors Holdings Ltd and Ralph Lauren Corp were among the top-mentioned brands by social media users during New York Fashion Week, the result of a push by fashion houses to build buzz among fans who otherwise would not be exposed to their shows.Both companies were among the top five brands that received the most mentions on Twitter Inc	 during the week, which occurs twice a year and is considered one of the industry's highest exposure events, according to marketing technology company Amobee Brand Intelligence.Michael Kors received 70,902 related tweets and Ralph Lauren garnered 46,971 tweets from the start of Fashion Week on Feb 11 through its finish on Thursday.The brands had elaborate social media strategies, which included behind-the-scenes videos on the messaging app Snapchat and live footage of shows on Twitter's streaming video service Periscope.  As of Friday, they were also among the top five mentioned brands at event venues on Facebook Inc's photo-sharing app Instagram, according to data from Ground Signal, a location-based social media search company.  Engaging with users of social media is increasingly important to designers because it helps them draw attention of consumers, not only buyers and press who attend the show.The strategy is also a way to reach younger fans. According to Ground Signal, roughly a third of Instagram posts were from users under the age of 25.  “We know we need to be where our customer is, and today she is on all of these platforms consuming more content more quickly than ever before,” Lisa Pomerantz, a Michael Kors spokeswoman, said by email. Chatter on social media sites can drive demand for designers' collections. Rebecca Minkoff, a maker of luxury handbags and clothing, promoted designs on several platforms under the hashtag #SeeBuyWear. Its New York-based store did four times its usual business following Saturday's show, a Minkoff spokeswoman said in an email. Major fashion houses did not receive the same level of attention as widely known music artists with their own fashion lines. According to Amobee, rapper Kanye West's Yeezy line drew more than 800,000 tweets, and singer Rihanna's Fenty x Puma collection brought in over 140,000, topping the list when it came to Twitter traffic.Other brands with significant Twitter mentions included PVH Corp's Tommy Hilfiger, Malan Breton and Coach Inc.

1348,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan  Target Corp's (TGT.N) quarterly sales at established stores topped analysts' estimates as its initiatives around higher-profit items drove traffic, showing that the company's turnaround efforts under CEO Brian Cornell were gaining traction.The U.S. retailer, whose shares rose as much as 4 percent to $76.95, also forecast a higher-than-expected adjusted profit for the full year.Same-store sales at rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) missed market expectations last week, hurt by a strong dollar and sluggish apparel demand.Target's apparel sales rose in the fourth quarter, in contrast to weak sales at several retailers including Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) and Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N).Cornell, Target's chief executive since August 2014, has been aggressively trying to turnaround the company after several years of sluggish growth.Some of his efforts include promoting and investing in a narrower set of higher-margin ""signature"" categories such as baby and health and wellness, and pulling out of Canada. Comparable sales in higher-margin categories rose by more than three times the company average in the quarter ended Jan. 30, Target said, with  women's apparel, wearable electronics and food being the fastest growing.""Signs that CEO Cornell's strategic initiatives are gaining traction include: 'signature' categories re-accelerating to about 6 percent growth and traffic rising 1.3 percent,"" Sterne Agee analyst Renato Basanta said.Apparel sales were helped by better in-store and online presentation and the stocking of trendier styles, Target finance chief Cathy Smith said on a media call. ""We believe that Target performed somewhat above the market (in apparel) thanks to its more fashion-savvy shopper demographic and its strong marketing efforts around holiday looks,"" Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, wrote in a note.Concerns about a slowdown in Target's digital sales were also alleviated by its 34 percent growth in the quarter, Sterne Agee's Basanta said, terming it ""solid progress for Target's still nascent platform.""The concerns stem from Target's warning in November that it would miss its target of growing online sales by 40 percent in 2015 due to slowing electronic sales. Sales at Target stores open at least 13 months increased 1.9 percent in the quarter, beating the 1.5 percent rise analysts had expected.Excluding items, Target earned $1.52 per share, missing the average estimate by 2 cents, due to promotions.Total sales fell 0.6 percent to $21.63 billion, mainly due to the sale of its pharmacy business to CVS Health Corp (CVS.N).

1409,"  May 28 PPL Corp said Wednesday it completed refueling and maintenance work on its 1,260-megawatt (MW) Unit 1 at the Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania but decided to keep the reactor shut for turbine work.PPL decided to work on the turbine so the company can complete a root cause analysis of the plant's turbine issues later this year, company spokesman Joe Scopelliti said in an email.He did not say when the unit would likely return to service.PPL has worked on or inspected the turbines at both Susquehanna units several times over the past few years. In some cases, the company has shut the unit specifically to look at the turbines, while in other cases PPL used a shutdown for other reasons such as refueling or an unplanned outage to inspect the turbines.Since 2011, the company has inspected the turbines in Unit 1 at least five times and Unit 2 at least six times. Unit 2 most recently shut for a couple weeks in March for turbine work.Scopelliti has said in the past the problem is with the low-pressure turbines. He said each unit has three low-pressure turbines and one high-pressure turbine. The low-pressure turbines were replaced in 2003 and 2004.German engineering company Siemens AG  manufactured the low-pressure turbines and is working with PPL to resolve the issue. The high-pressure turbines, meanwhile, were replaced between 2008 and 2011 as part of an uprate or power increase for the reactors.Meanwhile, the 1,260-MW Susquehanna 2 was operating at full power early Wednesday, according to a report by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.---------------------------------------------------------- PLANT BACKGROUND/TIMELINE STATE:      Pennsylvania COUNTY:     Luzerne TOWN:       Salem Township OPERATOR:   PPL Susquehanna LLC OWNER(S):   PPL Corp (90 pct) Allegheny Electric Coop Inc (10 pct) CAPACITY:   2,520 MW UNIT(S):    1 - 1,260-MW General Electric boiling waterreactor2 - 1,260-MW General Electric boiling water reactor FUEL:       Nuclear DISPATCH:   Baseload COST:       $4.1 billion  TIMELINE: 1983       - Unit 1 enters commercial service 1985       - Unit 2 enters commercial service 2008       - PPL files with NRC to build one of Areva SA's1,600 MW Evolutionary Power Reactors(EPR) at the site to be called Bell Bend.

1422,"   By Amrutha Gayathri  Electricity producer Talen Energy Corp TLN.N said private equity firm Riverstone Holdings LLC will buy the remaining stake it does not already own in the company for about $1.8 billion, amid a string of deals in the U.S. power industry.Talen Energy's shares were up nearly 16 percent in early morning trading on Friday.Falling demand in both open and regulated power markets due to increased energy efficiency and a weak economy has led to several deals as U.S. power producers and utilities look to cut costs.Talen was formed when Riverstone's generation assets were merged with Pennsylvania power company PPL Corp's (PPL.N) merchant generation business.Merchant power generation businesses sell power to wholesale markets, where prices are not regulated by the government.Shares of Talen, which owns or controls 16,000 megawatts of generating capacity for wholesale power markets, in northeast, mid-Atlantic and southwest regions of the United States, began trading in May last year. Riverstone will offer $14 per share in cash for the 65 percent stake it does not own, representing a 17.3 percent premium to Talen's Thursday close.""Valuation is high compared with where Talen shares trade, but it's consistent with public market deals,"" Guggenheim Partners LLC analyst Shahriar Pourreza said.""Stock hasn't fared well versus the other independent power producers,"" Pourreza said. ""The assets aren't as great and likely better in hands of private equity."" Through Thursday's close, Talen shares had more than halved since May last year.The agreement, which has an enterprise value of $5.2 billion, provides for a ""go-shop"" period of 40 days, during which Talen may enter into talks with parties that offer alternate proposals.The deal is expected to be funded by converting Riverstone's existing stake into shares of the new company, Talen's cash on hand, and a $250 million secured term loan. The power company would be required to pay a fee of $50 million to Riverstone if the agreement is terminated for a better proposal, but the fee will be reduced to $25 million if it accepts a superior proposal made during the go-shop period.Pourreza said a new bidder is not likely to emerge.Citi is Talen Energy's financial adviser for the deal and Kirkland & Ellis LLP its legal adviser. Goldman Sachs & Co and RBC Capital Markets are the financial advisers to Riverstone, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Vinson & Elkins LLP its legal advisers.

We are focused on improving performance of all of our businesses"", Ghasemi said on a conference call on Wednesday. The CEO's messages were ""well-received by investors who were looking for changes in the company and ways to improve margins,"" SunTrust Robinson analyst James Sheehan said.Air Products reported a 9 percent rise in third-quarter profit to $314 million, or $1.46 per share. The company, however, tightened its continuing operations profit forecast range for 2014. Air Products expects profit of $5.72 to $5.77 per share, compared with $5.70 to $5.85 it forecast earlier.Lower industrial activity in Latin America and moderating growth in emerging markets is expected to weigh on the company's profit this year, Sheehan said.Bigger rival Praxair Inc, also cut the upper end of its full-year profit forecast. The company's second-quarter growth was hurt by weak sales volume in South America, mainly due to negative industrial production in Brazil. Industrial output in Brazil, once one of the most dynamic of emerging economies, has slumped over the last three months and is on track to shrink more than 1 percent this year.Praxair earned 16 percent of its total quarterly revenue from Latin American countries.Air Products, which has a relatively lower exposure to the region, is depending on improvement of economic activity in the United States.Air Products shares were trading up 3 percent at $134.56 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, while that of Praxair were down less than a percent.

1437,"   By Nita Bhalla  BHOPAL, India (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Hundreds of protesters gathered on Wednesday outside the abandoned factory which caused the world's deadliest industrial disaster in the Indian city of Bhopal, burning effigies and demanding justice for survivors suffering 30 years later.Elderly women and men, some of whom were injured by the toxic cyanide gas leak, together with activists, supporters and children - some born with physical and mental disabilities - held up banners and chanted ""We want justice!""In the early hours of Dec. 3, 1984, around 40 tons of methyl isocyanate gas accidentally leaked from a pesticide factory owned by U.S. multinational Union Carbide Corp. and was carried by the wind into the surrounding slums.The government recorded 5,295 deaths. Activists estimate 25,000 deaths from illnesses since the leak. Many people still suffer from cancer, blindness, respiratory problems and immune and neurological disorders, with little support, they say.""I was pregnant and living ... near the factory on that night. We woke up with our eyes burning and could hear people outside screaming,"" said Rambhai Kailash, 50, whose daughter was born with muscular dystrophy and whose husband died from cancer five years after the disaster. ""The compensation I received at the time was so little that it was immediately used up on medical treatment for my husband and daughter,"" she said as protesters lit a massive diamond-shaped effigy with a skull and ""Dow Chemical"" painted on it. Activists accuse the Indian and U.S. governments and the Dow Chemical Company, which now owns Union Carbide, of not doing enough to support victims of the disaster. They want more financial compensation for the victims and the removal of thousands of tons of toxic waste around the plant, which has seeped into the ground with activists saying this is poisoning the water of 50,000 people.     CALLS FOR FURTHER ACTION Dow Chemical has denied liability, saying it bought Union Carbide a decade after the firm settled its liabilities to the Indian government in 1989 by paying $470 million.But activists said that was a paltry sum based on the extent of human suffering and various petitions to hold Dow to account and insist on increased compensation and cleaning up the waste are being pressed in Indian and U.S. courts.""The time has come to bring Dow and Carbide to justice. No more hiding behind share ownership and legal loopholes,"" said Salil Shetty, Secretary-General of Amnesty International. A spokeswoman for Dow declined to comment, referring calls to the company's subsidiary Union Carbide Corp. An email from Tomm Sprick of the Union Carbide Information Centre said the company was not doing any interviews and referred to information on its website which features many facts ""which have been forgotten or overlooked in the past 30 years.""In an email last week, Sprick said UCC had the ""utmost respect and sympathy for the victims"" but many of the issues ""have already been resolved and responsibilities assigned.""The government of central Madhya Pradesh state, where Bhopal is located, held a prayer meeting on Wednesday to mark the 30th anniversary of the leak and the Indian parliament in New Delhi observed a two-minute silence for the victims of the disaster.  Government officials deny neglecting victims and failing to help many survivors. They say the Supreme Court decides who is eligible for compensation and free healthcare after receiving a list of the affected people.""This has been put before the Supreme Court and the court has decided, after extensive examination of their cases, what is to be paid and to whom,"" Pravir Krishn, the state's principal secretary at the department in charge of rehabilitation for Bhopal's victims, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Krishn said some families seeking compensation or medical help were not from contaminated locations, suggesting they falsely claimed to be victims of the tragedy.He said the state had provided 40 billion rupees ($650 million) to 575,000 people identified by the Supreme Court as being affected by the disaster, built state-of-the art hospitals and provided houses for many survivors.While many events surrounding the disaster's anniversary have focused on issues such as the lack of healthcare, compensation and job opportunities for survivors and their families, some have asked whether another Bhopal could happen.The Delhi-based think-tank Centre for Science and Environment released a book on Monday that said that while India has laws covering hazardous waste management and industrial disasters, there is no compliance.""While we have thankfully not witnessed another major Bhopal-type disaster in the last 30 years, we have a number of mini Bhopals - small types of gas leaks from industry - all over the country,"" said Sunita Narain, CSE's director.(This story was refiled to add dropped words in paragraph 19)",2014-12-03,PX,"Wed Dec 3, 2014 | 1:01pm EST",Victims call for justice 30 years after Bhopal disaster,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-india-bhopal-anniversary-idUSKCN0JH1RN20141203?type=companyNews,-0.9922,0.139,0.789,0.072

The STOXX Europe 600 fell 0.8 percent. While it closed flat on Monday, it had touched its highest level since Britain voted in June to leave the European Union.Schindler Holding AG fell 4.3 percent, the biggest faller on the index after it cut the top end of its revenue growth outlook for the year as increasing uncertainty in the Chinese construction market and the recession in Brazil continues to hurt the Swiss elevator manufacturer.Industrial firm Rotork fell 2.1 percent, the top STOXX 600 faller, after HSBC cut the valve-control systems maker to ""reduce"" from ""hold"".K&S fell to a three year low, with the potash firm down 12 percent since results were announced last week. It dropped after UBS cut its target price on the stock and reiterated its ""sell"" rating, saying that potash prices were likely to stay under pressure.""We continue to see an oversupplied potash market... Closures are happening but the demand side of the equation does not look too favourable,"" analysts said in a note.At the other end of the STOXX 600, Switzerland's Geberit  rose 4.6 percent to a record high after it beat expectations with its second quarter results and struck a confident tone for its outlook.

A BaFin spokesman said the watchdog was routinely investigating whether there were suspicious purchases of shares in connection with the aborted Praxair talks but added that the probe was not targeted at any particular individuals.A Linde spokesman said Reitzle's share purchases had been in accordance with corporate governance and financial markets regulation.

1473,"   By Arno Schuetze and Jens Hack | FRANKFURT/MUNICH  FRANKFURT/MUNICH U.S. industrial gases group Praxair (PX.N) has revived efforts to combine with German rival Linde (LING.DE), seeking to overcome differences over key personnel and location of headquarters that scuppered previous talks in September.A person close to Munich-based Linde, which also operates medical gas and engineering businesses, told Reuters that Praxair had tried to address the main stumbling blocks to talks on creating a $60 billion-plus market leader.Linde's supervisory board is expected to discuss the fresh approach at its next regular meeting on Dec. 7, another person familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.Linde shares jumped 6.6 percent to 160 euros, a one-year high, outperforming a broadly unchanged DAX .GDAXI index of German blue-chip stocks.The failed merger talks led to changes at the top at Linde, with finance chief Georg Denoke leaving immediately and Chief Executive Wolfgang Buechele staying on only until April.That leaves Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle, Buechele predecessor as CEO, as the most powerful figure at Linde. Reitzle was seen as a driving force behind the initial merger talks but now faces the challenges of having to rebuild the group's leadership, cut costs and deal with the U.S. suitor.  Buechele said in October that a revival of merger talks was not on the cards and put the emphasis on a further restructuring to respond to low growth.TOUGH TIMES Linde, Praxair and peers Air Liquide (AIRP.PA) and Air Products (APD.N) are struggling with slower economic growth that has weakened demand in the manufacturing, metals and energy sectors, putting pressure on smaller players and leading to consolidation in the sector. Air Liquide bought Airgas Inc, the leader in U.S. packaged gases, in a $13.4 billion transaction finalised in May.Linde said late on Tuesday it was looking into a revised proposal it had received from Praxair about a merger of equals. Praxair later confirmed it approached Linde about resuming discussions about a potential merger.""We believe a merger could offer at least 13 percent upside to our standalone value for Linde,"" said UBS analyst Geoff Haire. The cutbacks Linde is pursuing on its own ""may not be enough to offset the impact of the low growth environment for gases coupled with continued pressure on healthcare pricing in the U.S. and limited growth for Engineering,"" Haire added.Praxair CEO Steve Angel said last month that his team had not had the chance to fully assess the future role of Linde's headquarters within a combined entity when talks ended and that he was open to resuming discussions.But negotiations are likely to be tough.""We expect Linde to try to command very favorable merger terms (share exchange ratio, Munich location, etc.) which Praxair, who is known for its bidding discipline, will struggle to accept,"" Bernstein analyst Jeremy Redenius said in a note on Wednesday.Praxair generates lower core earnings but with a higher margin over sales than its German peer. Both groups carry a broadly similar value on the stock market, Linde having a market capitalization of around 28 billion euros ($29.82 billion), compared with a figure of $35 billion for Praxair.

1477,"   By Ludwig Burger, Greg Roumeliotis and Arno Schuetze | FRANKFURT  FRANKFURT Germany's Linde agreed to revive talks with U.S. rival Praxair  to create a $65 billion industrial gases giant which will have its main operations run from Connecticut, two sources familiar with the deal said on Wednesday.The deal is being pursued as a ""merger of equals"" thanks to a 50:50 valuation split, these people said.But a combined company will have its operating base in Danbury, Connecticut, where Praxair is headquartered and Praxair's Chief Executive Steve Angel will head the merged company, these sources said on Wednesday, after Linde confirmed it would resume talks.In a largely symbolic gesture, Linde will be the name of the combined company, and Wolfgang Reitzle, Linde's chairman would also be chairman of the combined firm, the sources said.   A ""meaningful"" representation would be retained in Germany, these people said, adding that the primary listing would be in New York and the secondary listing in Frankfurt.Talks broke down in September amid disagreements over where the combined firm would have its headquarters and research and development, as well as over who would occupy the main management roles, sources told Reuters at the time.On Wednesday Linde's chief executive Wolfgang Buechele paved the way to a revived deal by stepping down with immediate effect. ""With the resumption of the talks, a successful merger is now drawing near,"" Buechele said in a statement.Buechele will be replaced by Aldo Ernesto Belloni, a 66-year-old former executive board member who retired two years ago. ""With a succession plan in place, the necessary continuity is assured without interruption for the demanding tasks of the coming months,"" Buechele added, without elaborating on why he was leaving some four months earlier than planned.The companies now aim to have drawn up an outline agreement before the Christmas holidays, sources close to the matter said.Belloni, who retired at the end of 2014 after 14 years on Linde's management board, is a close ally of non-executive Chairman Wolfgang Reitzle, who needed to steady the ship after an exodus of key people in the wake of the collapse of initial merger talks with Praxair in September.Finance Chief Georg Denoke left immediately after the talks failed in September while Buechele said he would stay on only until April 2017, leaving Reitzle, Buechele's predecessor as CEO, to plot the company's future course.Linde and Praxair, alongside rivals Air Liquide and Air Products, are struggling with slower economic growth that has weakened demand from the manufacturing, metals and energy industries and put pressure on smaller players,  leading to further consolidation in the sector. Air Liquide bought Airgas Inc, the leader in U.S. packaged gases, in a $13.4 billion deal finalised in May.Praxair generates lower core earnings but with a higher sales margin than its German peer. Shares in Linde were up 2.4 percent at 160 euros on Wednesday, valuing the company at around 29.8 billion euros ($32 billion). Shares in Praxair were up 1.7 percent at $121,   giving it a market value of around $34.6 billion.Linde decided to resume negotiations after Praxair offered  to locate some central functions of the combined group in Germany, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. Under the proposed new terms, one of the combined entity's executive board members would be based in Munich, where Linde is headquartered, and the main German sites would be preserved, the sources said.Linde said the supervisory board vote to resume talks was unanimous, meaning the board's labor representatives must have been won over.Sources close to the matter have said that opposition from the workers' representatives due to concerns for German jobs was a factor in the failure of talks in September.Still, the success of a deal hinges on a clear chain of command. On an earnings conference call on October 27, Praxair's Angel said a deal could yield significant synergies ""by ensuring upfront that leadership is unambiguous, and the company is operated in a clear and consistent way."" Angel said Praxair's “operational excellence"", could complement Linde's “technology in engineering.”Linde had already said last week it was considering a revised proposal it had received from Praxair about a potential merger of equals, which was confirmed by Praxair.
