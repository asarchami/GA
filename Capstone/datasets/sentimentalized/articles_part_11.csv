Shares of Pfizer boosted both the Dow and S&P 500 after its better-than-expected quarterly profit.The market rebound came after heavy losses tied to concerns about withdrawal of U.S. monetary stimulus as well as worries about emerging markets, including slowing Chinese growth and political turmoil from Turkey to Thailand. Last week, the S&P 500 marked its worst percentage loss since June 2012.""Maybe some relief of the selling pressures is the cause for the rally,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Market participants were looking at recent soft economic data, a mixed earnings season and concerns about what's happening in non-U.S. equity markets, he said. As a result,  ""there is a growing collection of wisdom the Fed may postpone its tapering regime tomorrow.""Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods unexpectedly fell 4.3 percent in December, and a gauge of planned business spending on capital goods also slid, which could cast a shadow on an otherwise bright economic outlook.The durable goods report preceded the start of a two-day policy meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve. Investors will closely watch the outcome to see if the Fed will cut another $10 billion from its monthly bond-buying program. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 91.22 points or 0.58 percent, to 15,929.1, the S&P 500 gained 10.65 points or 0.6 percent, to 1,792.21 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 9.474 points or 0.23 percent, to 4,093.083.A bright spot in the economic data was a report showing U.S. consumer confidence rose in January. Consumers grew more optimistic about both business conditions and the job market, according to the Conference Board.Apple shares fell to their lowest since October.

16,"  * STMicro aims to outperform market in 2014 - CEO* Sees drop in first-quarter revenue* Says orders jumped 20 pct between Q3 and Q4By Gwénaëlle BarzicPARIS, Jan 28 European chipmaker STMicroelectronics forecast a return to profit in 2014 after suffering two years of losses, hit by a decline in orders from phone maker Nokia. The Franco-Italian company, whose chips are used in cars, computers and mobile phones, posted a ninth straight quarterly loss but said it expects this year to outperform market growth forecasts, currently around 4.2 percent.It said its performance would be boosted by an improved order book, cost cuts and having exited its loss-making ST-Ericsson joint-venture with telecom network gear maker Ericsson last year.""We are definitely positive on generating a profit in the fiscal year 2014,"" Chief Financial Officer Carlo Ferro told reporters on a conference call on Tuesday. Orders jumped 20 percent between the third and fourth quarter of 2013, Chief Executive Carlo Bozotti said.STMicro is the eighth-largest semiconductor maker by global sales but has lost ground to rivals like Qualcomm, Intel and Samsung in recent years because of its higher cost base and difficulties suffered by Nokia, once its largest customer. In the past year, it has particularly focused on cars, high-end smartphones and motion sensors but that move has yet to pay off in terms of profit.For the fourth quarter of 2013, the company reported an operating loss of $11 million on revenue of $2.01 billion, broadly in line with analysts' forecasts. That compared with a loss of $730 million on revenue of $2.16 billion in the same period of 2012.It said it expected 2014 first-quarter revenue to fall by about 9.5 percent on a quarterly basis, plus or minus 3.5 percentage points, due to its exit from the ST-Ericsson joint-venture.The firm's share price was up 1.8 percent at 5.75 euros at 1400 GMT, while Europe's Stoxx 600 technology index  was flat.STMicroelectronics shares climbed 8.8 percent last year, while Europe's Stoxx 600 technology index rose 27 percent.

17,"  STMicroelectronics NV (STM.PA) posted lower quarterly revenue and a narrow loss on Monday underscoring how the European chipmaker is losing ground to rivals as orders from its key customer Nokia NOK1V.HE shrink.The company, whose chips are used in cars, computers and mobile phones, reported an operating loss of $11 million on fourth-quarter revenue of $2.01 billion. The revenue was lower than the $2.1 billion logged a year ago but largely unchanged from the previous quarter.Analysts had forecast revenues of $2.03 billion on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company had earlier predicted that fourth-quarter sales would be unchanged from the prior three months, plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. After a loss-making third quarter, STMicro pushed back a key profit margin target by six months, blaming higher sales of chips for low-end mobile phones that are not as profitable as chips for high-end phones like Apple's iPhone or Samsung's Galaxy line.Last year, STMicro and telecom network gear maker Ericsson ended their joint venture to make chips for mobile phones. Since then, STMicro has refocused on product lines for automobiles, video game consoles, and high-end smartphones, but that move has yet to pay off in terms of higher profits. Franco-Italian STMicro is the eighth-largest semiconductor maker by global sales, but has lost ground to rivals like Qualcomm (QCOM.O), Intel (INTC.O) and Samsung (005930.KS) in recent years because of its higher cost base and the decline of Nokia.Worldwide semiconductor revenue rose 5.2 percent last year to $315.4 billion from $299.9 billion in 2012, according to market research group Gartner. Intel kept the leading spot by sales, despite lower demand for computers that caused its chip sales to fall 2.2 percent, while Samsung and Qualcomm both notched up growth, according to Gartner.

21,"   By Michael Martina and Matthew Miller | BEIJING  BEIJING Qualcomm Inc, the world's biggest cellphone chip maker, may be hit with a record fine exceeding $1 billion in a Chinese antitrust probe, raising the specter of harsh penalties for foreign firms facing an increasingly aggressive regulator.China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) initiated an investigation into Qualcomm last year and is currently holding talks with the U.S. company, which this month said it was still in the dark about the basis of the scrutiny.The probe and the potential fine - the amount of which could hinge on negotiations - come as the NDRC zooms in on information technology providers, especially companies that license patent technology for mobile devices and networks.Industry experts say the NDRC, the government's main economic planning body, is trying to lower domestic costs as China rolls out its faster 4G mobile networks this year.""It is, in some ways, a game of chicken,"" said Yee Wah Chin, a New York-based antitrust expert at law firm Ingram, Yuzek, Gainen, Carroll and Bertolotti.""While the (fine) money may be very attractive to the NDRC, they would also be happy if Qualcomm were to make all sorts of commitments regarding its technology and the licensing of the technology,"" she told Reuters.San Diego-based Qualcomm, which is scheduled to report quarterly results later on Wednesday, is positioned to reap the vast majority of licensing fees for the chip sets used by handsets in China, the world's biggest smartphone market. Chinese telecom firms may invest as much as 100 billion yuan ($16.4 billion) in equipment for 4G networks.Under the anti-monopoly law, the NDRC can impose fines of between 1 and 10 percent of a company's revenues for the previous year. Qualcomm earned $12.3 billion in China for its fiscal year ended September 29, or nearly half of its global sales.Lawyers say the fine is likely to be extremely high if Qualcomm fails to make concessions in its talks with the NDRC.""We intend to continue cooperating fully with the NDRC,"" Qualcomm spokeswoman Christine Trimble said when asked about the probe. In December, the head of the NDRC's anti-price-fixing bureau told state media there was ""substantial evidence"" against Qualcomm in the antitrust probe. Details, however, remain sketchy.INCREASING SCRUTINY The Qualcomm probe is a prime example of the uncertainty foreign firms are grappling with as China's regulators target key industries to shield consumers from practices that could lead to what they call ""unreasonably"" high prices.It also shows the NDRC's seriousness in using its antitrust rules. In 2011, the agency imposed one of its first major penalties against a foreign company, a $300,000 fine on Unilever Plc for violations of the pricing law.The NDRC has also slapped Chinese and foreign companies with investigations and fines in the past year.In August, the regulator fined six infant formula manufacturers, including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co, Danone and Fonterra, a record $110 million after a probe into price fixing and anti-competitive practices. The anti-monopoly law provision does not specify whether the 10 percent ceiling for fines applies to global or domestic sales, or to a particular product line.At the lowest legal threshold, the fines on Qualcomm could surpass those in the infant formula cases. Fines at the top of the range would put the Qualcomm case on par with major antitrust rulings in the United States and Europe.""They (NDRC) keep as much discretion for the decision maker as possible,"" said Peter Wang, a China-based antitrust expert with law firm Jones Day. ""Technically it would appear they can't go below one percent, though they have other ways to reduce the fines based on cooperation.""MAJOR MARKET Qualcomm is no stranger to substantial fines. In 2009, South Korea's Fair Trade Commission fined the company 273 billion won ($252 million), the agency's biggest ever penalty against a single company, for abusing its dominant position in CDMA modem chips which were then used in handsets made by Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics.Falling afoul of Chinese regulators would be painful for Qualcomm, which saw revenues in China more than double over the last two years.

24,"  * Q4 royalties revenue $130.4 mln vs forecasts of $137.9 mln* Company sees royalties up about 19 pct in 2014* Licensing beat expectations* Shares fall sharplyBy Paul SandleLONDON, Feb 4 British chip designer ARM Holdings  said a slowdown in demand for Apple and Samsung  smartphones was behind a smaller than expected rise in fourth-quarter royalty revenues.ARM, whose technology is in nearly every smartphone, reported processor royalties of $130.4 million, up 7 percent, but short of analyst forecasts of $137.9 million.The top-end smartphone market has showed signs of reaching saturation, with Apple and Samsung, both ARM customers, last month reporting lower than expected sales of the iPhone 5S and Galaxy S4 phones in the holiday season.But the Cambridge-based company also said there was strong demand for licensing its technology across a whole range of applications from servers to dishwashers, exercise machines and wearable technology such as smart watches. ARM said its royalties continued to grow faster than the broader semiconductor market, but the degree of outperformance was impacted by slower sales of chips for high-end smartphones in the second half of the year.Chief Financial Officer Tim Score said the smartphones, which provide just under half of ARM's royalty revenue, were ""slowing down"" at the very high end, but cheaper devices were selling well.""Overall royalties in 2014 we expect to grow at a similar rate to the last three years, broadly 19-20 percent,"" he said.Royalties make up just over half of ARM's revenues, with licenses accounting for slightly less than half.ARM shares fell to a five-month low after the results, and were down 3.1 percent at 902.5 pence at 1034 GMT. Score said ARM continued to see strong demand for the licensing of its energy-efficient technology for new uses in networking, servers and wearable devices.Processing licensing revenue rose 26 percent to $107.2 million in the fourth quarter, beating market consensus expectations of $94.7 million.""We continue to benefit from the growth of digital electronics ... from smart consumer electronics such as phones, tablets and TVs, to energy efficient enterprise networking and serves to more embedded computing into things like smart sensors and wearable technology,"" he said. 10 BILLION CHIPS Analyst Julian Yates at Investec said: ""Royalties were slightly below expectations due to slower high end smartphone sales."" He said he expected to trim royalty estimates by about 3 percent, having forecast 22 percent year-on-year growth.But the stronger licensing outlook would compensate, he said, resulting in no change to his headline numbers, which were about 5 percent below consensus. He sees 2014 pretax profit of 419.8 million pounds.ARM licenses its designs to partners, such as Qualcomm Inc  and Samsung and receives a small royalty on every chip shipped. Some 10 billion ARM-based chips were shipped in 2013, Score said.The chips in the latest smartphones, such as the first 64-bit processors in the iPhone 5S, carry higher royalty rates than those in simpler phones.Score said, however, mid and low-tier smartphones, where most of the growth will come in the next five years, were  incorporating more and more ARM technology, enabling it to stick to its medium-term forecast of 15-25 percent per year growth in smartphone royalties over the next five years.Overall, ARM posted a 19 percent rise in pretax profit to 95.5 million pounds ($156 million) on revenue up 15 percent at 189.1 million pounds, broadly in line with expectations.The company said it expected to meet analyst forecasts for 2014 revenue, which Score said stood at $1.28 billion.",2014-02-04,QCOM,"Tue Feb 4, 2014 | 6:40am EST",UPDATE 2-Smartphone slowdown hits ARM's royalties in fourth quarter,http://www.reuters.com//article/arm-results-idUSL5N0L90VZ20140204?type=companyNews,0.994,0.028,0.868,0.104
25,"  By Paul SandleLONDON Feb 5 British microchip maker Wolfson Microelectronics swung to an underlying loss in the final quarter of 2013 after it struggled against Qualcomm's  dominance in 4G mobile phone technology.The Edinburgh-based company that specialises in audio technology is a supplier for the 3G version of Samsung's  Galaxy S4 smartphone but its chips were not in the 4G model of the top-selling handset. Chief Executive Mike Hickey said the company paid the price for a ""faster than anticipated transition from 3G to 4G smartphones that benefited a competitor"".He acknowledged that Qualcomm is the dominant provider of processing technology for first-generation 4G phones, but expects Wolfson to catch up as more platforms compatible with its chip technology enter the market. ""There are a lot of other silicon providers, such as Samsung LSI, Broadcom, Intel and Nvidia, all bringing to market alternative LTE (4G) platforms, and we are the natural choice for our customers with those platforms,"" Hickey said.Wolfson posted an underlying operating loss of $4.5 million for the final quarter of 2013, against a profit of $1.5 million for the same period a year earlier, on revenue that dipped to $42 million from $56.1 million. Hickey said he expects the company to resume its growth trajectory in the second half of 2014 as customers, including Chinese smartphone makers, launch new products using Wolfson's technology and as new LTE platforms come to market.Shares in Wolfson fell to a two-year low of 109 pence after the results, which analysts said were slightly worse than expected. They were trading down 9 percent at 120 pence by 1147 GMT.The outlook for first-quarter revenue of between $28 million and $36 million was also below consensus, which stood at $36.8 million, Citi analysts said.",2014-02-05,QCOM,"Wed Feb 5, 2014 | 6:51am EST",UPDATE 1-Chipmaker Wolfson Micro misses out on early 4G demand,http://www.reuters.com//article/wolfson-idUSL5N0LA15Q20140205?type=companyNews,0.0617,0.043,0.917,0.04
26,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Qualcomm Inc, the world leader in smartphone microchips, may want to shore up its defensive tactics.Taiwan's MediaTek Inc, the leading chip supplier for Chinese smartphones, is barreling into the U.S. market with a new major global branding campaign and setting up shop in San Diego, California, home to Qualcomm.This year, MediaTek plans to hire about 150 engineers, business development and marketing staff in the United States, adding to a 300-strong U.S. workforce, said Kristin Taylor, MediaTek's vice president of U.S. corporate marketing. Outside the United States, the company plans to add 1,000 employees in 2014, increasing its ranks by around 10 percent.""We really feel that it's a strategic area,"" she said of San Diego's Sorrento Valley, where MediaTek plans to open its new office in the next few months. It is home to many technology companies clustered around Qualcomm, one of the city's largest employers.""A lot of our technology partners sit in that area and we want to be able to serve them,"" said Taylor, a former Qualcomm veteran who joined MediaTek last year.MediaTek is relatively unknown outside Asia, where it has grown in the past decade to become the dominant supplier of low-cost cellphone chips, instrumental in helping companies such as China's Xiaomi and South Korea's LG Electronics Inc produce handsets that sell for less than $100 each.MediaTek plans this month to launch a rebranding campaign highlighting its expansion beyond China and into the United States and other developed markets led by Qualcomm.""We need to redefine that we really are at this point serving the entire globe and not just small pockets of the world,"" Taylor said. She declined to give more details ahead of its launch. Lacking relationships with U.S. phone carriers, MediaTek is unlikely to challenge Qualcomm's command of the high-end phone market soon, analysts said. In the mid- and low-tier categories, the Taiwanese company's ability to produce chips very cheaply is giving it an edge over other U.S. players like Broadcom Corp, Nvidia Corp and even Intel Corp, which are all trying to compete with Qualcomm.MediaTek, whose stock market value of $18 billion surpasses Broadcom and Nvidia, far outsells Qualcomm in handsets aimed at Chinese consumers but it supplies processors for less than 3 percent of smartphones sold in the United States, according to Strategy Analytics analyst Sravan Kundojjala.MediaTek believes its future chips will help manufactures make cheap phones that can compete in quality against more expensive devices made with Qualcomm's components.""The opportunity lies in picking up one of the fringe (manufacturers), giving them an excellent platform, great performance and a good price,"" said Evercore analyst Patrick Wang. ""Get a couple of those who get traction at a carrier in the U.S. and suddenly you see MediaTek's export share increase a lot.""SEEKING NEW GROWTH  Founded in 1997, MediaTek got its start designing chips for digital televisions and optical devices like DVD players, before turning its attention to cellphones. Last year, it sold over 200 million smartphone chips in Asia and became the world's 14th largest semiconductor company, according to research firm IHS.MediaTek's expansion into the U.S. market comes as it faces more competition in China, where Qualcomm as well as up-and-coming rivals like Shanghai-based chipmaker Spreadtrum are replicating its low-cost model.Analysts on average expect MediaTek's revenue growth to slow to 30 percent in 2014, from 36 percent in 2013. While that far outpaces Qualcomm's forecast 8 percent revenue growth, JPMorgan has warned that MediaTek could be hurt by the slower rollout of next-generation wireless products in China.With a strategy that centers on offering manufacturers turnkey blueprints for quickly making inexpensive phones, MediaTek's sights are set on mid-range smarpthones from the likes of Lenovo or Huawei, rather than premium devices from Apple Inc or Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Some analysts expect mid-range phones to gain popularity in the U.S. market, where a price war between carriers is expected to intensify this year.MediaTek's move into mid-priced devices in China and around the world, along with efficient cost controls, may push its 2013 operating margin of 18 percent up another 4 percentage points over the next two years, said Evercore's Wang.Like competitors, MediaTek is rushing to roll out wireless chips featuring Long-Term Evolution, an advanced technology for faster data transfer. LTE has become standard in U.S. phones and it is slowly being introduced in other parts of the world.So far, that technology is dominated by Qualcomm as rivals have run into delays launching their own LTE chips due to the technology's complexity. That has left handset manufacturers craving an alternative.""Qualcomm owns 90-plus percent of the LTE modem market. That's not a comfortable place for many of these OEMs (original equipment manufacturers),"" said IDC analyst Les Santiago. ""That alone will create an opportunity for a second-place LTE player. The issue is - who will that be?""For its part, Qualcomm said rivals have underestimated the challenge of making LTE chips that work well on different carriers' networks. The company has made four generations of LTE products, a much longer track record than MediaTek and others.""We'll see what happens when the products show up,"" Qualcomm Senior Marketing Director Peter Carson said of rivals' plans for LTE. ""We know the industry continues to underestimate the increasing complexity of the LTE roadmap. We believe we have a performance advantage.""(Editing by Tiffany Wu, Edwin Chan and Bernard Orr)",2014-02-07,QCOM,"Fri Feb 7, 2014 | 3:08pm EST",Analysis: Taiwan's MediaTek sets up backyard brawl with Qualcomm,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-mobile-us-mediatek-idUSBREA161RL20140207?type=companyNews,0.9967,0.029,0.863,0.108

30,"   By Michael Martina and Benjamin Kang Lim | BEIJING, March 3  BEIJING, March 3 China will present proposals to revamp its behemoth economic planning agency at an annual session of parliament this week, sources said, but the organisation's role as an antitrust regulator could eventually be enhanced.Chinese and foreign companies, including U.S. technology firms Qualcomm Inc. and InterDigital Inc., have fallen afoul of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in recent months as its anti-monopoly arm has become more assertive.The mammoth agency, which has several thousand employees and has sweeping powers to decide on investment, prices and other issues in the world's second-biggest economy, is striving to retain as much power as possible as it undergoes restructuring. The crackdown on price-fixing and monopolistic practices should become more pronounced as the NDRC has said it is ramping up staffing in its antitrust division.Academics and senior officials have forecast a streamlining of the NDRC since President Xi Jinping vowed to make the economy more responsive to market forces and shift to consumer-focused investment from a state-led model.Two sources close to senior leaders said proposals have been readied to restructure the NDRC and these will be discussed at the National People's Congress annual session beginning on Wednesday.It was not immediately clear if any decisions would be taken.But the NDRC's role as one of three national antitrust regulators - along with the Commerce Ministry and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce - is set in the country's five-year-old Anti-Monopoly Law that is unlikely to be cut back or revised soon.""The NDRC is getting ready for a new role. This corresponds with the flurry of antitrust actions,"" said a Beijing-based foreign diplomat who asked not to be named.Xu Kunlin, the head of the NDRC's price supervision and anti-monopoly bureau, has hinted at more unified antitrust powers, underlining speculation that the agency is seeking for primacy among the three regulators.""Having a relatively independent, authoritative or strong and unified antitrust body is a trend. Many antitrust structures around the world are under one roof,"" Xu said last month. Xu's comments could be part of the NDRC's attempt to focus on the antitrust role, and stay relevant as its broader powers are slashed, said Yee Wah Chin, a New York-based antitrust expert at law firm Ingram, Yuzek, Gainen, Carroll and Bertolotti.""The NDRC will continue to expand its AML (anti-monopoly law) enforcement scope by the investigations it conducts, and it is entirely possible that some formal restructuring of AML enforcement will be made after several more years,"" Chin said.FINES, INVESTIGATIONS Last year, the NDRC slapped Chinese and foreign companies with investigations and fines after high-profile pricing probes. In August, the regulator fined six infant formula manufacturers, including Mead Johnson Nutrition Co, Danone  and Fonterra, a record $110 million after a probe into price fixing and anti-competitive practices. The agency confirmed last month it had opened anti-monopoly investigations into Qualcomm and InterDigital, saying it had received complaints that the companies charged discriminatory high prices in China.Adam Dunnett, secretary general of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said he expects the pricing investigations to maintain their momentum in the medium term.""The European Chamber has encouraged its members to review their own practices and closely monitor further developments,"" he said, adding that the anti-monopoly law would play an important role in a more market-oriented China if evenly enforced.At the moment, the NDRC sets policy for strategic industries, approves big investments and has the authority to influence prices for everything from liquor to gasoline. Its powers are so sweeping that it is often called the mini cabinet.Beijing has promised to reduce its involvement in matters like the approval of new industrial projects, allowing it instead to focus on improving rules and regulations. According to one proposal, the agency would be renamed the National Development, Reform and Planning Commission and fold in functions of other departments, including the Development Research Centre, a cabinet think-tank.""Eventually, the NDRC will just be a think-tank. Its main functions will be to formulate (policies) and conduct research on macro (economic) planning,"" one source with ties to the leadership said on condition of anonymity.""The views of various ministries and provincial governments have been solicited,"" a second source said.The party announced after a conclave last November that a high-powered committee would be created to oversee the gamut of China's reforms, including coordination between ministries. President Xi heads the group which experts have said could signal changes to the NDRC's discretionary powers.""I do expect the NDRC's wings to get clipped,"" said Scott Kennedy, director of the Research Centre for Chinese Politics and Business at Indiana University.""The creation of the leading group on economic reform is already a big signal that the NDRC's powers will be cut,"" he said.The NDRC did not respond to Reuters questions sent by fax.However, a rapid transition is unlikely within such a huge bureaucracy.""The government has been cutting red tape but we cannot see any signs of downsizing,"" an NDRC researcher told Reuters on condition of anonymity, noting that there would be stiff federal-level employees.""The NDRC will still approve investment plans involving state spending.

He was named in December to replace Paul Jacobs, the son of a Qualcomm co-founder.""A lot of people talk about the fact that everyone has a smartphone. That's true to some degree in some parts of the world, but the world is a big place and there are a lot more smartphones coming,"" Mollenkopf told the shareholders meeting.Qualcomm's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 for the past 12 months as smartphone demand shifts from the United States and other developed countries, where top-tier phones like the iPhone have become ubiquitous, to China, where consumers tend to buy less expensive devices with lower-end displays and other features.Mollenkopf pointed to wireless connectivity, cameras, sensors and audio as key smartphone technologies Qualcomm is improving and which he said will help drive demand.

36,"   By Matthew Miller | BEIJING, March 10  BEIJING, March 10 TCL Corp expects group revenues to surpass 100 billion yuan ($16.32 billion) this year for the first time as the Chinese electronics giant increasingly turns to Europe, Latin America and the United States to sell more smartphones and televisions.TCL expects to see sustained revenue growth at its handset company, now the world's fifth-biggest, while profits at its television unit are expected rebound, company chief executive Thomson Li Dongheng told Reuters.Li also called on Qualcomm Inc., the U.S. chipset maker, to lower the fees it charges Chinese companies.TCL Multimedia Technology Holdings, TCL's Hong Kong-listed television unit, posted losses of HK$119 million ($15.33 million)last year even as revenue increased 9.6 percent to HK$39.5 billion, as overstocking of raw materials and supplier mishaps raised sales costs.""We have to be more competitive and speed up the transformation of the television business,"" Li said in an interview on the sidelines of China's annual parliamentary session in Beijing. Li said revenue for the TV set business should increase about 10 percent this year.TCL is targeting international markets, which now account for 42 percent of total sales, as cheaper technology makes Chinese-made electronic goods affordable in both emerging and developed markets. The percentage of global sales is expected to increase, Li said.TCL reported group revenue last year reached 85.32 billion yuan, an increase of 22.9 percent, while net profit jumped to 2.88 billion yuan. TCL Communication Technology Holdings, the group's Hong Kong-listed handset maker, makes more than 90 percent of its revenue offshore, primarily in the Americas and Europe.Last year, TCL purchased the rights to rename Grauman's Chinese Theater, along Hollywood's Walk of Fame in Los Angeles, the TCL Chinese Theatre..Handset sales in 2013 reached 55.2 million units, including 17.6 million smartphones, and have been a main driver for the company since last July. TCL Communications, which sells under the Alcatel brand overseas, also competes against Huawei Technologies Co, ZTE Corp and Lenovo Group . TCL's mobile phone sales should increase by 50 percent this year, Li said. Profitability remains an issue, particularly as increased competition forces handset makers to lower prices.""We remain concerned about how the company can cope with mounting smartphone margin pressure in both emerging and matured markets,"" wrote Andrew Hsu, an analyst with J.P. Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) Ltd in a research note last month.""Chinese companies are becoming more competitive. There are five Chinese brands in the world's top ten, but our profitability is poor compared with Samsung or Apple,"" Li said. ""Chinese firms do better against brands like LG, Nokia and Motorola.""The TCL chief also said he supported efforts by China's anti-monopoly regulator to help lower the license fees on chipsets paid to Qualcomm Inc. ""Qualcomm's patent fees, frankly speaking, are relatively high,"" said Li. ""Our profits last year were only a little more than 1 percent. It's clear this standard isn't reasonable.""TCL on average paid royalty fees amounting to 5 percent of sales for chipsets used in its 3G and 4G handsets.China's National Development and Reform Commission, which in November started investigating Qualcomm's rates, said in February that the San Diego-based firm was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position.Li said a more suitable level for all mobile royalties would be 3 percent.",2014-03-10,QCOM,"Mon Mar 10, 2014 | 4:22am EDT","TCL's Li doubles down on global markets, nudges Qualcomm on fees",http://www.reuters.com//article/chi-tcl-idUSL3N0M725N20140310?type=companyNews,0.969,0.037,0.871,0.092

48,"  SAN FRANCISCO, April 28 STMicroelectronics  posted lower first-quarter revenue and a loss that narrowed after the European chipmaker exited its mobile joint venture with ST-Ericsson.Franco-Italian STMicro, whose chips are used in cars, computers and mobile phones, posted first-quarter revenue of $1.825 billion, down from $2.009 billion in the year-ago quarter.Six analysts polled by Reuters on average had expected first-quarter revenue of $1.836 billion. Its net loss in the first quarter shrank to $24 million from $171 million in the same quarter the year before. Its non-GAAP loss per share was 1 cent.Last year, STMicro and telecom network gear maker Ericsson ended their money-losing joint venture to make chips for mobile phones. Since then, STMicro has refocused on product lines for automobiles, video game consoles, and high-end smartphones, but that move has yet to pay off in terms of higher profits. Excluding legacy ST-Ericsson products, the chipmaker's revenue grew 1 percent in the quarter. The company said its total revenue in the second quarter would rise 2 percent compared to the first quarter.STMicro is the eighth-largest semiconductor maker by global sales but it has lost ground to rivals like Qualcomm, Intel and Samsung in recent years because of its higher cost base and difficulties suffered by Nokia, once its largest customer.

Helping SMIC with 28 nm production will mean a boost to China's semiconductor industry and could help SMIC offer similar services to customers beyond Qualcomm.The Chinese government has placed enormous emphasis on moving the world's second-largest economy up the technology value chain in areas such as semiconductors.TSMC is now ramping up newer 20 nm manufacturing technology, allowing for increased power and efficiency by packing more transistors onto each chip.

62,"   By Michael Gold | TAIPEI  TAIPEI Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) fell as much as 6 percent on Thursday after an analyst and Taiwanese media reported the likely loss of orders for next-generation chips from Apple Inc and Qualcomm Inc.The world's largest contract chip manufacturer on Wednesday reported its highest quarterly profit since the end of 2006, and said it expected revenue to grow at least a record 20 percent this year.Behind the bullish outlook was likely increased demand from Apple which recently chose TSMC over Samsung Electronics Co Ltd to make the majority of chips for the successor to its iPhone 5 series of smartphones, industry insiders said.But both Apple and Qualcomm will likely buy a larger proportion of 14 nanometer smartphone chips from Samsung rather than TSMC beginning in the second half of 2015, KGI Securities analyst Michael Liu said in a note to clients.Liu did not detail the source of the information in the note, issued late on Wednesday following an investor conference held after TSMC reported second-quarter earnings. The Commercial Times on Thursday, citing market speculation, said Qualcomm has already started working with Samsung to develop the chips. The Economic Daily News said without citing sources that Qualcomm had placed orders with Samsung.The reports sent shares of TSMC down as much as 5.75 percent in Thursday trade compared with a 1 percent decline in the benchmark index.Yuanta Securities Analyst George Chang, who also attended the conference, said of Apple and Qualcomm on Thursday that ""This is still just a lot of speculation."" ""We haven't even seen the iPhone 6 yet, so it's too early to say anything about future products,"" Chang said.During the conference, TSMC Chairman Morris Chang said the company's market share in 16 nanometer chips - which perform similarly to 14 nanometer chips - will be smaller than ""a major competitor"" next year, and that TSMC will regain a leading share from 2016. The size of chips in the latest high-end smartphones is 28 nanometers, according to TSMC.On Thursday, spokespeople at TSMC in Taiwan and Apple in China could not be reached for comment.A Qualcomm representative in China said she had not seen the reports and so declined to comment. A Samsung representative in South Korea also said she had not seen the reports and declined to comment.

67,"  BEIJING Xiaomi launched its flagship Mi 4 smartphone at a glitzy event in Beijing, where the Chinese budget handset maker's chief executive sought to challenge larger U.S. rival Apple Inc.The Mi 4 comes as budget handset makers in China are competing more aggressively on price and generous features, with even high-end manufacturers feeling the pressure.South Korea's Samsung Electronics Ltd said this month that its disappointing smartphone shipments were due to poor sales in China, which had 1.27 billion mobile subscribers in June.Dressed in a black T-shirt and blue jeans, Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun took aim repeatedly at iPhone maker Apple during the presentation on Tuesday, comparing the design and manufacturing process of his new 4G handset to the U.S. firm's more expensive offerings. ""Our product really is better than the iPhone,"" said Lei. ""Our white version is also better than their white version,"" he joked. ""Even our white color is whiter!"" Apple, which was due to announce second-quarter earnings later on Tuesday, was not immediately available to comment. The forthright Jun spent nearly an hour on stage describing the Mi 4 phone's construction - particularly its beveled metal rim whose similarity with Apple's phones drew murmurs of ""iPhone"" from the journalists at the event.The Mi 4, which goes on sale July 29 for 1999 yuan ($320), has a 5 inch, 1080p screen and a Qualcomm Inc Snapdragon 801 2.5 Ghz processor. An equivalent iPhone 5s costs $650.Analyst Neil Shah at technology consultant Counterpoint said that while Xiaomi was gaining swiftly in emerging markets, it did not pose a real threat to Apple just yet. ""Right now it's more a big talk rather than real threat to Apple,"" said Shah.""In emerging markets they are growing in leap and bounds, attracting buyers who aspire to Apple but they can't afford to buy Apple. ""But if tomorrow Xiaomi raise their price to Apple levels, they won't sell. They're trying to build that brand equity by comparing themselves to Apple."" Founded in 2010 by Lei and seven others, Xiaomi seeks to cut costs by eschewing brick-and-mortar stores in favor of web-based distribution and word-of-mouth marketing.Xiaomi became the world's sixth-largest smartphone vendor in the first quarter of 2014, according to data firm Canalys, after repeatedly doubling its sales. The company was valued at $10 billion last year, drawing industry speculation that the fast-rising company could threaten Apple and Samsung, which dominate the premium market.Xiaomi sold 18.7 million smartphones in 2013 and on Tuesday maintained a 60 million sales target for 2014. For comparison, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] has said it is targeting 80 million smartphone sales for the year.($1 = 6.2025 Chinese Yuan) (Reporting by Paul Carsten and Beijing newsroom; Editing by Erica Billingham)",2014-07-22,QCOM,"Tue Jul 22, 2014 | 8:36am EDT",China's Xiaomi hopes Mi 4 smartphone can take on Apple,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-xiaomi-smartphone-idUSKBN0FR0JO20140722?type=companyNews,0.9109,0.028,0.904,0.068

Now Qualcomm is struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China, including a growing number of local manufacturers the U.S. chipmaker has done little or no business with in the past.""There was some impact in the quarter that we just reported in Q3 and we expect the impact will be larger in the next quarter and potentially for a number of quarters until we can get these things resolved,"" Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said in an interview.While most of Qualcomm's revenue comes from selling chips that enable phones to communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its widespread CDMA cellphone technology.

Although those features failed to impress reviewers,  similar features could become prevalent in future handsets launched by other companies. [ID:nL4N0PZ59P]The device opened by iFixit includes 32 gigabytes of NAND memory chips made by Samsung Electronics for storing pictures, music and other media. The phone, which has a 4.7 inch LCD display, included 2 gigabytes of DRAM memory from Samsung.Manufacturers of mobile hardware often employ more than one supplier for memory chips and other components in their devices. The handset also included a near field communication chip, enabling features such as mobile payments, from NXP, according to iFixit.Joining Amazon's ""Fire"" lineup of tablets and streaming devices, the new phone aims to stand out in a crowded field dominated by Apple Inc and Samsung. It has specifications similar to high- and mid-range smartphones and runs on a modified version of Google's Android operating system. ""Fire"" is priced at $649 contract-free or $199.99 with a contract with AT&T Inc – in the same neighborhood as the iPhone.

75,"   By Paul Carsten and Michael Martina | BEIJING  BEIJING China's antitrust regulator has confirmed that Qualcomm Inc, one of the world's biggest mobile chipmakers, has a monopoly, the state-run Securities Times newspaper reported on Thursday, as Qualcomm's chief executive held talks in China.  The regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), is investigating Qualcomm's local subsidiary after it said in February the U.S. chipmaker was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, allegations which could see it hit with record fines of more than $1 billion.The Securities Times report, based on unidentified sources it said were close to the NDRC, did not say whether the regulator had determined that Qualcomm had abused its monopoly.Angela Zhang, an antitrust expert at King's College London, said the report was a ""loose expression that the NDRC has gathered facts that Qualcomm has abused its dominant position.""""It seems likely that the decision will be announced soon,"" she said, noting that having a monopoly alone is not a violation of China's anti-monopoly law.Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf, who launched a $150 million ""strategic venture fund"" in China on Thursday, declined to take questions from reporters. A spokeswoman travelling with Mollenkopf also declined to comment on the newspaper report.    The NDRC declined to provide immediate comment.China is a key market for Qualcomm, accounting for nearly half of its revenue. The country is the world's biggest market for smartphones and is preparing to roll out faster 4G mobile networks this year.While most of Qualcomm's revenue comes from selling chips that enable phones to communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its widespread CDMA cellphone technology. The Securities Times report said the NDRC was probing Qualcomm's local sales data and that Qualcomm's Aberle has been communicating with the NDRC over issues relating to the anti-monopoly investigation.    Analysts say that the process of confirming sales data is common in the late stage of an anti-trust investigation, and that the NDRC is likely calculating the extent of fines.Qualcomm President David Aberle, speaking as the company reported a lower-than-expected outlook for the September quarter on Wednesday, said ""some loss would be probable"" from the probe.""We are really not in a position to be able to estimate what that might look like, we just believe whatever the resolution may be, will likely include some form of payment,"" he added. Aberle said the investigation concerns Qualcomm's licensing business as well as interactions between its licensing business and its chipset business, and that the probe was making it harder to negotiate new 4G licenses with manufacturers in China. Qualcomm was also struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China, including a growing number of local manufacturers it has done little or no business with in the past, Aberle added. Some Chinese customers of San Diego-based Qualcomm, such as electronics giant TCL Corp, complain the firm is using its dominant market position to charge high patent fees on its chipsets. Industry experts, however, say the NDRC, which is also the government's main economic planning body, is trying to lower domestic costs as China rolls out the 4G mobile networks. TECHNOLOGY AND PATENTS The Securities Times said Qualcomm was charging lower royalties for patents to undercut competitors who have similar technology and maintain market share. The report also said that Qualcomm, as the only provider of chips for high-end phones, can dictate those fees.During the launch of the China fund, Qualcomm CEO Mollenkopf defended the company's licensing programme, saying the $30 billion spent in research and development over the company's lifetime had allowed it to spread its technology in China. ""It's really why anybody that signs up on a license, actually does it voluntarily – because it is a way of leveraging all of that R and D,"" Mollenkopf said.Under China's six-year-old anti-monopoly law, the NDRC can impose fines of between 1 and 10 percent of a company's revenues for the previous year.

76,"  * China regulator 'confirms' Qualcomm has monopoly -report* Report did not say if regulator found abuse of monopoly* Almost half of Qualcomm FY13 revenues came from China   (Adds quotes from Qualcomm executives, details from earnings, background)By Paul Carsten and Michael MartinaBEIJING, July 24 China's antitrust regulator has confirmed that Qualcomm Inc, one of the world's biggest mobile chipmakers, has a monopoly, the state-run Securities Times newspaper reported on Thursday, as Qualcomm's chief executive held talks in China.The regulator, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), is investigating Qualcomm's local subsidiary after it said in February the U.S. chipmaker was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, allegations which could see it hit with record fines of more than $1 billion.The Securities Times report, based on unidentified sources it said were close to the NDRC, did not say whether the regulator had determined that Qualcomm had abused its monopoly.Angela Zhang, an antitrust expert at King's College London, said the report was a ""loose expression that the NDRC has gathered facts that Qualcomm has abused its dominant position.""""It seems likely that the decision will be announced soon,"" she said, noting that having a monopoly alone is not a violation of China's anti-monopoly law.Qualcomm CEO Steven Mollenkopf, who launched a $150 million ""strategic venture fund"" in China on Thursday, declined to take questions from reporters. A spokeswoman travelling with Mollenkopf also declined to comment on the newspaper report. The NDRC declined to provide immediate comment.China is a key market for Qualcomm, accounting for nearly half of its revenue. The country is the world's biggest market for smartphones and is preparing to roll out faster 4G mobile networks this year.While most of Qualcomm's revenue comes from selling chips that enable phones to communicate with carrier networks, most of its profit comes from licensing patents for its widespread CDMA cellphone technology.The Securities Times report said the NDRC was probing Qualcomm's local sales data and that Qualcomm's Aberle has been communicating with the NDRC over issues relating to the anti-monopoly investigation.Analysts say that the process of confirming sales data is common in the late stage of an anti-trust investigation, and that the NDRC is likely calculating the extent of fines. Qualcomm President David Aberle, speaking as the company reported a lower-than-expected outlook for the September quarter on Wednesday, said ""some loss would be probable"" from the probe.""We are really not in a position to be able to estimate what that might look like, we just believe whatever the resolution may be, will likely include some form of payment,"" he added.Aberle said the investigation concerns Qualcomm's licensing business as well as interactions between its licensing business and its chipset business, and that the probe was making it harder to negotiate new 4G licenses with manufacturers in China.Qualcomm was also struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China, including a growing number of local manufacturers it has done little or no business with in the past, Aberle added. Some Chinese customers of San Diego-based Qualcomm, such as electronics giant TCL Corp, complain the firm is using its dominant market position to charge high patent fees on its chipsets.Industry experts, however, say the NDRC, which is also the government's main economic planning body, is trying to lower domestic costs as China rolls out the 4G mobile networks.TECHNOLOGY AND PATENTS The Securities Times said Qualcomm was charging lower royalties for patents to undercut competitors who have similar technology and maintain market share. The report also said that Qualcomm, as the only provider of chips for high-end phones, can dictate those fees.During the launch of the China fund, Qualcomm CEO Mollenkopf defended the company's licensing programme, saying the $30 billion spent in research and development over the company's lifetime had allowed it to spread its technology in China.""It's really why anybody that signs up on a license, actually does it voluntarily - because it is a way of leveraging all of that R and D,"" Mollenkopf said.Under China's six-year-old anti-monopoly law, the NDRC can impose fines of between 1 and 10 percent of a company's revenues for the previous year.

80,"  (Adds Kaspersky and analysts' comments)By Soham Chatterjee and Jim FinkleAug 4 U.S. security software maker Symantec Corp  and Russia's Kaspersky Lab downplayed a move by Beijing to exclude them from a list of anti-virus vendors whose products are approved for sale to central government agencies in China.The People's Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, said on its English Twitter feed on Sunday that the government's procurement agency has excluded Symantec and Kaspersky from a list of security software suppliers.Kaspersky confirmed on Monday that authorities in Beijing had moved to restrict government purchases of software from non-Chinese companies.""Chinese Central Government Procurement Center temporarily rescinded its endorsements of all foreign security providers,"" Kaspersky spokeswoman Susan Rivera said.""However, this restriction only applies to national-level institutions whose funding comes from the central government procurement budget, and does not include regional governments or large enterprises."" Symantec said in a statement that the list referred to in Chinese media reports only affected some types of products.""It is important to note that this list is only for certain types of procurement and Symantec products are not banned by the Chinese government,"" the statement said.  ""We are investigating this report and will continue to bid for and win government projects in China.""Shares of Symantec closed up 1.7 percent at $23.56 on the Nasdaq on Monday. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.72 percent. The People's Daily also tweeted that it had approved the use of five Chinese anti-virus software vendors: Qihoo 360 Technology Co, Venustech, CAJinchen, Beijing Jiangmin and Rising.FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said he sees the development becoming a more contentious issue over the coming months.""It's another headwind for the company as Symantec already faces numerous challenges to show growth again. China remains a headache situation for Symantec as well as other U.S. tech providers across the board."" Ives said. Symantec said last month it was in talks with Chinese authorities following reports that China had banned use of one of its products, data loss prevention software.Sunday's report is the latest sign that Beijing is intent on promoting use of domestic information technology amid concerns about U.S. spying and the indictment of five Chinese military officers on cyber espionage charges.Still, Eric Johnson, dean of the business school at Vanderbilt University and an expert on cyber security issues, said the Chinese government's move is only a ""symbolic one"" and will have ""little meaningful impact"" on Symantec.Chinese technology corporations like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and ZTE Corp have grown into sophisticated global conglomerates in past years, and some analysts speculate that Beijing is promoting its local industry standard-bearers on its own home turf at the expense of U.S. corporations.Chinese state media have lashed out at Google Inc, Apple Inc and other U.S. technology companies, calling on Beijing ""to punish severely the pawns"" of the U.S. government for monitoring China and stealing secrets.U.S. tech companies such as Microsoft Corp and Qualcomm Inc have recently faced anti-trust investigations, while IBM Corp and Cisco Systems Inc  have reported declining sales in China.

85,"   By Ben Blanchard and Matthew Miller | BEIJING  BEIJING Qualcomm Inc, under investigation for possible monopolistic practices in China, said it had no direct financial links with an antitrust expert sacked from a government advisory post after state media reported he had received payments from the firm. The San Diego-based company has been under investigation since November by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), one of China's three antitrust regulators, over how the company licenses its patents and prices its chipsets. Qualcomm is among an array of foreign firms that have been scrutinized by the government as China intensifies efforts to bring companies into compliance with its 2008 anti-monopoly law. At stake are financial penalties equivalent to as much as 10 percent of a company's annual revenue.  As part of the NDRC probe, Qualcomm hired Global Economics Group to produce an economic analysis for submission to the regulator, Christine Trimble, a spokeswoman at the chipset maker, told Reuters on Thursday. She said the Chicago-based consultancy employed Zhang Xinzhu, a member of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and one of China's leading antitrust experts, to co-write the report. Zhang was dismissed from the State Council's expert commission on competition issues for taking ""huge rewards"" from Qualcomm, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Wednesday.""Qualcomm paid Global Economics its standard rates for the firm's services,"" Trimble said, and did not have ""any financial dealings"" with Zhang directly. David Evans, chairman of Global Economics Group, declined to comment. The Qualcomm analysis was submitted to the NDRC in May and had three principal authors, including Zhang. Earlier, the 40-year-old professor also provided expert analysis for several domestic conglomerates including China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unionpay, as well as foreign firms involved in antitrust investigations such as Yum! Brands Inc.""Hiring economists to provide such economic analysis to antitrust authorities is routine practice in government investigations in China and around the world,"" Trimble said.The NDRC said in February that the chipmaker was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, allegations which could see it hit with record fines of more than $1 billion.  Under the six-year-old anti-monopoly law, the NDRC can impose fines of between 1 and 10 percent of a company's revenues for the previous year. ONLY SILENCE Zhang had ""contravened work discipline"" and been removed from his position on the anti-monopoly committee, reported Xinhua. The news agency said ""certain multinational companies"" had been attempting to delay antitrust probes, including spending money to gain support on experts groups and complaining of being picked on for being foreign. ""Against this backdrop, hiring relevant 'experts' from government departments to 'speak on behalf of foreign companies' is a violation of discipline ... This matter should be gotten to the bottom of and bought to light,"" Xinhua said.  In a short, emailed response to questions from Reuters, Zhang wrote on Wednesday: ""(My) individual strength is too insignificant, and the machine of state too powerful. There can only be silence.""The 21-member anti-monopoly academic experts group from which Zhang was dismissed was established in 2011. The group is seen to serve the principal role of providing the bureaucracy with the supporting arguments needed to justify its industrial policy aims, a source in the U.S. business community familiar with the Qualcomm case told Reuters. Zhang also has been critical of the NDRC in numerous articles published in Chinese media in recent years, which may have put him at odds with individuals at the regulator, said a Beijing-based industry person who is familiar with the workings of the advisory group.Zhang argued that at times the regulator had acted outside of its jurisdiction and misused antitrust principles.""Any enforcement should be based on the law and facts and not rely on public sentiment for judgment,"" Zhang wrote in a 2012 commentary published on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology news website. EU CONCERN The latest development comes amid a local newspaper report that China would fine German premium auto brand Audi around 250 million yuan ($40.63 million) for violating anti-monopoly laws.That followed a statement from Audi late on Wednesday that said it would accept a penalty and change management processes at one of its China units after a regional authority said it had found violations of antitrust laws.The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China on Wednesday expressed its concern over the series of antitrust investigations, saying China was using strong-arm tactics and appeared to be unfairly targeting foreign firms.The auto sector has been under particular scrutiny, and the NDRC, China's state economic planner, has been investigating it amid accusations by state media that global car makers are overcharging consumers.European car brands including Volkswagen AG's Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz are scrambling to lower prices for new cars and spare parts in an effort to appease Chinese regulators who have accused some of them of anti-competitive behavior.Chinese authorities say the law is applied to both domestic and foreign firms, with the aim of protecting consumers.

Brands Inc.""Hiring economists to provide such economic analysis to antitrust authorities is routine practice in government investigations in China and around the world,"" Trimble said.The NDRC said in February that the chipmaker was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, allegations which could see it hit with record fines of more than $1 billion.Under the six-year-old anti-monopoly law, the NDRC can impose fines of between 1 and 10 percent of a company's revenues for the previous year.ONLY SILENCE Zhang had ""contravened work discipline"" and been removed from his position on the anti-monopoly committee, reported Xinhua. The news agency said ""certain multinational companies"" had been attempting to delay antitrust probes, including spending money to gain support on experts groups and complaining of being picked on for being foreign.""Against this backdrop, hiring relevant 'experts' from government departments to 'speak on behalf of foreign companies' is a violation of discipline ... This matter should be gotten to the bottom of and bought to light,"" Xinhua said.In a short, emailed response to questions from Reuters, Zhang wrote on Wednesday: ""(My) individual strength is too insignificant, and the machine of state too powerful. There can only be silence.""The 21-member anti-monopoly academic experts group from which Zhang was dismissed was established in 2011. The group is seen to serve the principal role of providing the bureaucracy with the supporting arguments needed to justify its industrial policy aims, a source in the U.S. business community familiar with the Qualcomm case told Reuters.Zhang also has been critical of the NDRC in numerous articles published in Chinese media in recent years, which may have put him at odds with individuals at the regulator, said a Beijing-based industry person who is familiar with the workings of the advisory group. Zhang argued that at times the regulator had acted outside of its jurisdiction and misused antitrust principles.""Any enforcement should be based on the law and facts and not rely on public sentiment for judgment,"" Zhang wrote in a 2012 commentary published on the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology news website.EU CONCERN The latest development comes amid a local newspaper report that China would fine German premium auto brand Audi around 250 million yuan ($40.63 million) for violating anti-monopoly laws.That followed a statement from Audi late on Wednesday that said it would accept a penalty and change management processes at one of its China units after a regional authority said it had found violations of antitrust laws.The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China on Wednesday expressed its concern over the series of antitrust investigations, saying China was using strong-arm tactics and appeared to be unfairly targeting foreign firms.The auto sector has been under particular scrutiny, and the NDRC, China's state economic planner, has been investigating it amid accusations by state media that global car makers are overcharging consumers.European car brands including Volkswagen AG's  Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz are scrambling to lower prices for new cars and spare parts in an effort to appease Chinese regulators who have accused some of them of anti-competitive behaviour.Chinese authorities say the law is applied to both domestic and foreign firms, with the aim of protecting consumers. The NDRC has said it has targeted domestic telecoms companies, including China Unicom and China Telecom Corp, and domestic financial institutions for anti-trust practices.U.S. companies aside from Qualcomm have also been caught up in the investigations, including software giant Microsoft Corp . Such probes have rekindled concerns that the Chinese government may be using the anti-monopoly law to support domestic firms at the expense of foreign companies.

87,"   By Michael Martina and Se Young Lee | BEIJING/SEOUL  BEIJING/SEOUL Chinese antitrust officials have met with their South Korean counterparts to discuss violations by U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), sources said, as Beijing reaches out to regulators overseas to complete a case that could result in record fines at home.Qualcomm is one of at least thirty foreign firms to come under scrutiny as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law - efforts some critics say have unfairly targeted overseas businesses, raising protectionism concerns.The Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) fined San Diego-based Qualcomm more than $200 million in 2009 for abusing its dominant market position, but the stakes are bigger in China, where an investigation by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) could trigger changes to Qualcomm's licensing deals and fines of as much as a tenth of a company's annual revenue. Qualcomm had total revenue of almost $25 billion in the year to Sept. 29, 2013, about half of it in China. ""The Chinese authorities were very interested in how South Korea handled such issues and asked a lot of questions about South Korea's experiences,"" said a person who was present at meetings in May and June between the KFTC and the NDRC's price supervision and anti-monopoly bureau.  It's unlikely the NDRC could use exactly the same rationale as South Korea against Qualcomm, added the person, who didn't want to be named because of the sensitivity of the case. ""What China takes most exception to is that royalties on intellectual properties are comparatively higher in China. But high price itself shouldn't be an antitrust matter. It's only a problem when there are elements like discriminatory practices,"" the person said.Qualcomm has been under investigation by the NDRC, one of China's three antitrust regulators, since November last year over how it licenses its patents and prices its chipsets.  Exchanges between regulators are not uncommon, but some experts say the NDRC has relied on pressure tactics instead of detailed economic analysis to drive its cases. That the NDRC went to the KFTC months after the case was announced, they say, could indicate the bureau is looking for a legal justification for a case it had already launched.There are concerns that a central aim of the meetings between China and South Korea was to ""solicit advice in an economic argument against Qualcomm,"" a person in the U.S. business community familiar with the case said. ""It's putting the cart before the horse. They have reached a conclusion and attempted to get the facts later,"" the person said.""THOROUGH EXCHANGES"" In a statement about the meeting that took place in South Korea, the KFTC said: ""China's NDRC, seeking to advance its regulatory enforcement, requested that the Fair Trade Commission share economic analysis techniques used to deal with actual cases.""

The NDRC antitrust bureau, its delegation led by Director General Xu Kunlin, said in statements issued after the meetings that the two sides held ""thorough exchanges"". The NDRC did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.None of the statements specifically mentioned Qualcomm.Xu, an outspoken advocate of expanding the use of China's anti-monopoly law, has publicly stated that his bureau is hamstrung by under-staffing.

""If you increased my staff by 100 workers, perhaps then I could actively investigate,"" he said. ""I think everybody would agree they are understaffed – they don't have enough people – and they are very new at this,"" said Peter Wang, an antitrust expert and Shanghai-based partner for law firm Jones Day. ""It's often easy to find theories for possible antitrust problems, but it takes an extensive amount of experience to be in a position to make good decisions about when something is likely to be a real problem and, just as important, when it's not.""Nonetheless, a slew of recent high-profile probes into overseas firms has rekindled concerns that Beijing may be using the investigations to support domestic industry.The NDRC this week fined Japanese auto parts makers a record 1.235 billion yuan ($201 million) for manipulating prices in China.

96,"   By Michael Martina | BEIJING  BEIJING Foreign companies are increasingly concerned they are being targeted by Chinese regulators, a U.S. business lobby said on Tuesday, as a Chinese antitrust agency defended probes into firms such as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O). The American Chamber of Commerce in China is the latest business lobby to air its grievances over a series of investigations scrutinizing at least 30 foreign firms, as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law.There are growing perceptions that multinational firms are under ""selective and subjective enforcement"" using ""legal and extra-legal approaches"", the Chamber said in a report.A survey of 164 members showed 49 percent of respondents felt foreign companies were being singled out in recent pricing and anti-corruption campaigns, compared to 40 percent in a late 2013 survey of 365 members. Twenty-five percent said they were uncertain, or did not know, and 26 percent said no.Chamber Vice Chairman Lester Ross told reporters the major expansion of enforcement was welcome in principle, but regulators were using ""extra-legal"" means to conduct investigations.""They have taken what are, in many instances, vague or unspecified provisions in the law and moved to enforce them, and  sought to enforce those means through processes that do not respect the notion of due process or fairness,"" Ross said.Sixty percent of respondents in the survey also reported they felt foreign business was becoming less welcome in China. ""TRANSPARENT AND JUST""  In an April letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Washington to get tough with Beijing on its use of anti-competition rules, which it said had been seized by China to advance industrial policies that nurture domestic companies.The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China in August expressed its concern over the antitrust investigations, saying China was using strong-arm tactics and appeared to be unfairly targeting foreign firms.Xu Kunlin, director general of price supervision and the anti-monopoly bureau at the National Development Reform Commission (NDRC), reiterated that local and foreign companies were being treated equally by the agency. ""Such accusations are groundless and baseless,"" Xu told the official China Daily newspaper.""Some of the NDRC monopoly investigations involve overseas multinationals, but that does not mean that we are targeting them,"" Xu said in an interview with the paper. ""Some business operators in China have failed to adjust their practices in accordance with the anti-monopoly law,"" he added. ""Others have a clear understanding of the laws, but they take the chance that they may escape punishment."" Xu said the NDRC, one of China's three antitrust regulators, was also handling cases involving state-owned firms and Chinese private sector companies. The automotive industry has been in focus for the last two or three years, Xu said. Last month, the NDRC slapped a record fine of $201 million on 12 Japanese automakers it said had engaged in price manipulation.The NDRC is investigating Qualcomm's local subsidiary after it said in February that the company was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, accusations that could lead to record fines of more than $1 billion.Another antitrust regulator, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said on Monday it had given Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) 20 days to reply to queries on the compatibility of its Windows operating system and Office software suite amid its probe into the world's largest software company.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang responded to a question on the chamber's paper at a regular press briefing, saying he hoped foreign companies ""will abide by Chinese law"".""Anti-monopoly is to protect consumers' rights and to create a more open, fair and impartial market environment,"" Qin said.

97,"  (Adds comment from China's Foreign Ministry, survey details)By Michael MartinaBEIJING, Sept 2 Foreign companies are increasingly concerned they are being targeted by Chinese regulators, a U.S. business lobby said on Tuesday, as a Chinese antitrust agency defended probes into firms such as U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.The American Chamber of Commerce in China is the latest business lobby to air its grievances over a series of investigations scrutinising at least 30 foreign firms, as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law.There are growing perceptions that multinational firms are under ""selective and subjective enforcement"" using ""legal and extra-legal approaches"", the Chamber said in a report.A survey of 164 members showed 49 percent of respondents felt foreign companies were being singled out in recent pricing and anti-corruption campaigns, compared to 40 percent in a late 2013 survey of 365 members. Twenty-five percent said they were uncertain, or did not know, and 26 percent said no.Chamber Vice Chairman Lester Ross told reporters the major expansion of enforcement was welcome in principle, but regulators were using ""extra-legal"" means to conduct investigations.""They have taken what are, in many instances, vague or unspecified provisions in the law and moved to enforce them, and  sought to enforce those means through processes that do not respect the notion of due process or fairness,"" Ross said.Sixty percent of respondents in the survey also reported they felt foreign business was becoming less welcome in China. ""TRANSPARENT AND JUST"" In an April letter to Secretary of State John Kerry and Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged Washington to get tough with Beijing on its use of anti-competition rules, which it said had been seized by China to advance industrial policies that nurture domestic companies.The European Union Chamber of Commerce in China in August expressed its concern over the antitrust investigations, saying China was using strong-arm tactics and appeared to be unfairly targeting foreign firms. Xu Kunlin, director general of price supervision and the anti-monopoly bureau at the National Development Reform Commission (NDRC), reiterated that local and foreign companies were being treated equally by the agency.""Such accusations are groundless and baseless,"" Xu told the official China Daily newspaper.""Some of the NDRC monopoly investigations involve overseas multinationals, but that does not mean that we are targeting them,"" Xu said in an interview with the paper.""Some business operators in China have failed to adjust their practices in accordance with the anti-monopoly law,"" he added.

Xu said the NDRC, one of China's three antitrust regulators, was also handling cases involving state-owned firms and Chinese private sector companies.The automotive industry has been in focus for the last two or three years, Xu said. Last month, the NDRC slapped a record fine of $201 million on 12 Japanese automakers it said had engaged in price manipulation.The NDRC is investigating Qualcomm's local subsidiary after it said in February that the company was suspected of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards, accusations that could lead to record fines of more than $1 billion.Another antitrust regulator, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said on Monday it had given Microsoft Corp 20 days to reply to queries on the compatibility of its Windows operating system and Office software suite amid its probe into the world's largest software company.China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang responded to a question on the chamber's paper at a regular press briefing, saying he hoped foreign companies ""will abide by Chinese law"".""Anti-monopoly is to protect consumers' rights and to create a more open, fair and impartial market environment,"" Qin said.

107,"   By Michael Martina and Xiaoyi Shao | BEIJING  BEIJING China's three anti-monopoly regulators on Thursday launched a vigorous defense of their recent investigations into foreign companies, which have prompted mounting international criticism, and said they are not targeting multinational firms.At least 30 foreign firms, including U.S. companies such as Qualcomm Inc and Microsoft Corp, have come under scrutiny as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law that some critics say is being used to unfairly target overseas businesses, raising protectionism concerns.""Our anti-trust enforcement work is strictly conducted according to regulations,"" said Xu Kunlin, director general of the National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) Price Supervision and Inspection and Anti-Monopoly Bureau.""It is fair and transparent. It is not targeting any market player, and of course, it is not targeting any foreign invested or foreign enterprises."" Xu added the investigation of Qualcomm, one of the world's biggest makers of mobile chips, was ""basically done"" and that the NDRC planned to meet the company's president, Derek Aberle, on Friday.Thursday's rare joint press conference, which also included anti-trust heads from the Ministry of Commerce and State Administration for Industry and Commerce, showed the regulators presenting a united front.It comes days after Premier Li Keqiang defended at a global forum a series of probes into overseas companies amid snowballing concern from the foreign business community. In the last two weeks, four leading international business lobbies have raised alarm over the investigations.Their complaints range from worries that foreign companies are being unfairly targeted by probes motivated by China's industrial policy aims, to concerns over the use of strong-arm tactics by Chinese regulators.On Wednesday, U.S. Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez spoke publicly about reports of China's enforcement of its anti-trust law and its investigation of Qualcomm. ""I am seriously concerned by these reports, which suggest an enforcement policy focused on reducing royalty payments for local implementers as a matter of industrial policy, rather than protecting competition and long-run consumer welfare,"" Ramirez said, without mentioning Qualcomm by name. Xu, said he had read the reports thoroughly but dismissed them as unrepresentative and lacking a factual basis.""We asked some of the companies we were investigating about the criticism in these reports. The companies told me they didn't know why they would issue these kinds of statements. They said they didn't make those criticisms and they didn't represent their opinions,"" Xu said.""Our communication with all of the companies we are investigating is extremely free-flowing."" RECORD FINES China's anti-trust enforcers have gone after an array of industries, including foreign automakers and tech firms. Last month, the NDRC fined Japanese auto parts makers a record 1.235 billion yuan ($201 million) for manipulating prices. The Qualcomm case could yield record fines of more than $1 billion.Regulators also on Thursday announced their first-ever punishments of foreign carmakers for price-fixing, fining a Chinese venture of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and the China sales unit of Fiat's Chrysler a combined $46 million. Qualcomm Executive Chairman Paul Jacobs declined to comment when asked about Aberle's meeting. ""We have a good business in China and we work very closely with the partners here,"" Jacobs said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum event in China's northern city of Tianjin.Separately, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) defended its investigation of Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest software company. Earlier this month, SAIC gave Microsoft 20 days to reply to queries on the compatibility of its Windows operating system and Office software suite. Director General Ren Airong, of SAIC's Anti-monopoly and Anti-unfair Competition Enforcement Bureau, said that ""many firms"" had reported that Microsoft was suspected of monopoly practices.Ren also said that Microsoft had ""more lawyers"" than any case the regulator has investigated and that the SAIC's ""every move"" was conducted under their view.The regulators said they were focused on domestic firms as well as foreign companies, though critics argue that fines on Chinese companies are typically lower. China took action against white liquor makers Kweichow Moutai Group and Wuliangye Group, imposing more than $70 million in fines collectively. They also have fined local insurance companies and cement producers.On Tuesday, China's Premier Li Keqiang waded into the fray, telling executives that the investigations were conducted ""legally, transparently and fairly"", in some of the highest level official comments on the issue to date.

108,"  (Adds quotes, background)By Michael Martina and Xiaoyi ShaoBEIJING, Sept 11 China's three anti-monopoly regulators on Thursday launched a vigorous defence of their recent investigations into foreign companies, which have prompted mounting international criticism, and said they are not targeting multinational firms.At least 30 foreign firms, including U.S. companies such as Qualcomm Inc and Microsoft Corp, have come under scrutiny as China seeks to enforce a 2008 anti-monopoly law that some critics say is being used to unfairly target overseas businesses, raising protectionism concerns.""Our anti-trust enforcement work is strictly conducted according to regulations,"" said Xu Kunlin, director general of the National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) Price Supervision and Inspection and Anti-Monopoly Bureau.""It is fair and transparent. It is not targeting any market player, and of course, it is not targeting any foreign invested or foreign enterprises.""Xu added the investigation of Qualcomm, one of the world's biggest makers of mobile chips, was ""basically done"" and that the NDRC planned to meet the company's president, Derek Aberle, on Friday.Thursday's rare joint press conference, which also included anti-trust heads from the Ministry of Commerce and State Administration for Industry and Commerce, showed the regulators presenting a united front.It comes days after Premier Li Keqiang defended at a global forum a series of probes into overseas companies amid snowballing concern from the foreign business community.In the last two weeks, four leading international business lobbies have raised alarm over the investigations. Their complaints range from worries that foreign companies are being unfairly targeted by probes motivated by China's industrial policy aims, to concerns over the use of strong-arm tactics by Chinese regulators.On Wednesday, U.S. Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Edith Ramirez spoke publicly about reports of China's enforcement of its anti-trust law and its investigation of Qualcomm.""I am seriously concerned by these reports, which suggest an enforcement policy focused on reducing royalty payments for local implementers as a matter of industrial policy, rather than protecting competition and long-run consumer welfare,"" Ramirez said, without mentioning Qualcomm by name.Xu, said he had read the reports thoroughly but dismissed them as unrepresentative and lacking a factual basis.""We asked some of the companies we were investigating about the criticism in these reports. The companies told me they didn't know why they would issue these kinds of statements. They said they didn't make those criticisms and they didn't represent their opinions,"" Xu said. ""Our communication with all of the companies we are investigating is extremely free-flowing.""RECORD FINES China's anti-trust enforcers have gone after an array of industries, including foreign automakers and tech firms. Last month, the NDRC fined Japanese auto parts makers a record 1.235 billion yuan ($201 million) for manipulating prices. The Qualcomm case could yield record fines of more than $1 billion.Regulators also on Thursday announced their first-ever punishments of foreign carmakers for price-fixing, fining a Chinese venture of Volkswagen AG and the China sales unit of Fiat's Chrysler a combined $46 million. Qualcomm Executive Chairman Paul Jacobs declined to comment when asked about Aberle's meeting. ""We have a good business in China and we work very closely with the partners here,"" Jacobs said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum event in China's northern city of Tianjin.Separately, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) defended its investigation of Microsoft Corp., the world's biggest software company.Earlier this month, SAIC gave Microsoft 20 days to reply to queries on the compatibility of its Windows operating system and Office software suite.Director General Ren Airong, of SAIC's Anti-monopoly and Anti-unfair Competition Enforcement Bureau, said that ""many firms"" had reported that Microsoft was suspected of monopoly practices.Ren also said that Microsoft had ""more lawyers"" than any case the regulator has investigated and that the SAIC's ""every move"" was conducted under their view.The regulators said they were focused on domestic firms as well as foreign companies, though critics argue that fines on Chinese companies are typically lower.China took action against white liquor makers Kweichow Moutai Group and Wuliangye Group, imposing more than $70 million in fines collectively. They also have fined local insurance companies and cement producers.On Tuesday, China's Premier Li Keqiang waded into the fray, telling executives that the investigations were conducted ""legally, transparently and fairly"", in some of the highest level official comments on the issue to date.Li said that only 10 percent of companies impacted by anti-trust investigations were foreign.

109,"  TOKYO Sharp Corp said it would begin mass-producing a new type of next-generation displays with Qualcomm unit Pixtronix from 2017, in the hopes that innovation would pay off in the long term as the firm nurses its finances back to health. Qualcomm and Sharp said the new type of panel, called MEMS-IGZO after their respective display technologies, uses less energy and can withstand harsher temperatures than the liquid crystal displays (LCD) used in most smartphones and tablets. ""LCD is really hitting its limits in a lot of things. We can go brighter and this is the first generation of this technology,"" said Greg Heinzinger, senior vice president of Qualcomm's technology licensing division and president of Pixtronix, at a briefing at Sharp's Tokyo office on Friday. Sharp is hoping that innovative display technologies can sustain its recovery from a massive 545.4 billion yen ($5.34 billion) net loss in the year to March 2013, with its dependence on panels for operating profit approaching 50 percent. The MEMS-IGZO panels, which use a high-speed shutter to display images, boast brighter colours than LCD panels as they do not require a color filter, allowing more illumination from the backlight. Sharp said it will market the new technology to automakers, and makers of industrial devices, smartphones and tablets, and aims to start mass-production in 2017. It has built a test line for the technology at its factory in Tottori prefecture on Japan's northern coast.  Before then, Sharp hopes to release curved LCD panels with its 'Free Form Display' technology, unveiled in June, which it showcased on Friday with a car dashboard featuring three illuminated circular dials.

120,"   By Gerry Shih and Noel Randewich | BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO  BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO Intel Corp is close to announcing an investment in Chinese-government affiliated mobile chipmakers Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics, its latest move to catch up in a smartphone chip industry led by Qualcomm Inc, according to two sources with knowledge of the plan.It was unclear how much Intel is paying or what portion of the companies the U.S. chipmaker is buying. The acquisition could be made through Tsinghua Unigroup, a government-affiliated private equity firm controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing, one of the sources said. Tsinghua Unigroup owns Spreadtrum and RDA. Intel, which has struggled to gain traction in the smartphone and tablet market, recently has sought to partner with mobile chipmakers in the hope they can help it gain the market dominance it has enjoyed with personal computers.An Intel spokesman declined to comment. Tsinghua Unigroup did not respond immediately to a request for comment.This week there have been several reports in China of a potential deal, including one on the sina.com.cn news portal quoting unnamed sources as saying Intel would get 20 percent of Tsinghua Unigroup for $1.5 billion. The Beijing government has said in published policy papers it views semiconductors as an industry of vital strategic importance and hopes to spur its development domestically.

124,"   By Gerry Shih, Noel Randewich and Matthew Miller | BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO  BEIJING/SAN FRANCISCO Intel's investment of up to $1.5 billion in two fast-growing Chinese mobile chipmakers has effectively aligned the U.S. giant with a third party - a Beijing government intent on producing a viable domestic challenger to the likes of Qualcomm and Samsung.For more than a decade, China has targeted semiconductor design and manufacture as a major focus of its industrial policy. Activity has picked up markedly over the past year with a spate of cross-border mergers and cooperation deals.""We've entered an inflection point where government policy has started to work - it's started to help the local semiconductor industry,"" said Nomura analyst Leping Huang.The deal hashed out by Intel Corp Chief Executive Brian Krzanich over 24 hours in Beijing in early August extends Intel's beachhead in China, the biggest battleground in the smartphone industry, and boosts the company's years-long effort to catch up to leading mobile chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.A key visit during the trip was to Yang Xueshan, the deputy chief of China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), who gave his blessing for the deal.The agreement, unveiled on Sept. 26, gives Intel a 20 percent stake in Spreadtrum Communications and RDA Microelectronics through shares in a Tsinghua University holding company, with the aim of jointly developing and marketing smartphone chips.China is the world's largest consumer and manufacturer of smartphones yet relies heavily on imported chips - particularly the processors that power the latest devices - made by San Diego-based Qualcomm, South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co, or MediaTek Inc of Taiwan.China's ramped-up activity also arrives on the heels of revelations about the U.S. surveillance program PRISM, which has prompted Beijing to undertake a slew of actions to enhance the security of its information technology industry.For Intel, the world's leading manufacturer of chips for personal computers, the Tsinghua deal offers an additional path into the world's biggest chip market after it was slow to recognize the mobile revolution and design new processors for smartphones and tablets. Intel spokesman John Mandeville declined to comment.NATIONAL TARGETS The China Semiconductor Industry Association estimates that revenue from China's chip industry reached 251 billion yuan($40.98 billion) in 2013, while domestic demand for chips amounted to 917 billion yuan, representing more than half of global semiconductor consumption. Deng Zhonghan, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering and National People's Congress, said in March that China's $210 billion worth of annual chip imports exceeds the value of the country's entire yearly petroleum imports.In June, the State Council offered the country's most comprehensive guidelines for the development of the semiconductor industry, outlining specific revenue targets for 2015 and 2020, with chip revenue set to grow at a better-than 20 percent annual clip, to reach 350 billion yuan by 2020.An important part of Beijing's effort, analysts and industry insiders say, was consolidation of Spreadtrum and RDA, two companies formerly trading independently on Nasdaq.The two companies were acquired a year ago for $1.7 billion and $900 million respectively by Tsinghua Unigroup, government-affiliated private equity group controlled by Tsinghua University in Beijing.As part of its recent deal, which is expected to close early next year, Intel and Unigroup will form a new holding company that contains Spreadtrum and RDA.Beijing wants the Unigroup companies to become competitive with Taiwan's MediaTek within five years and overtake Qualcomm within 10 years, according to a person familiar with Unigroup.TRUE PARTNERS  Since taking over in 2013, Krzanich has aggressively positioned Intel to catch up with Qualcomm, the leading mobile chipset maker.A central part of that strategy is China, where consumers are snapping up low-end smartphones made with low-cost chips from local suppliers like Spreadtrum and MediaTek.Intel started investing in local operations 20 years ago, and presently operates factories across the country for manufacturing, assembling and testing microprocessors. Intel also has research and development operations in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. In May, Intel said it reached an agreement with Fuzhou-based Rockchip to produce chips for tablets based on Intel's architecture.""With China, what they want is for you to be a true partner,"" Krzanich told reporters in September.

129,"   By Andrew Chung and Dan Levine  Oct 22 For two decades, companies that buy software patents to sue technology giants have been the scourge of Silicon Valley. Reviled as patent trolls, they have attacked everything from Google's online ads to Apple's iPhone features, sometimes winning hundreds of millions of dollars.But now the trolls are in retreat from the tech titans, interviews and data reviewed by Reuters show.In the wake of several changes in U.S. law, which make it easier to challenge software patents, patent prices are plummeting, the number of court fights is down, and stock prices of many patent-holding companies have fallen. Some tech firms say they are punching up research budgets as legal costs shrink, while support for major patent reform is under fire as trolls get trounced.""Their entire business model relies on intimidation, and that has lost its edge,"" said Efrat Kasznik, president of intellectual property consulting firm Foresight Valuation Group. ""If the patents are not enforceable in court anymore... the troll has no legs to stand on.""Brokers who work with the patent acquisition companies acknowledge the new climate.""In some cases, there are just no current buyers for these patents at all,"" said Robert Aronoff, founder of the patent brokerage Pluritas, citing new legal standards for the change.NetApp, a Silicon Valley maker of sophisticated data storage devices, last month used a new legal precedent to force a patent holder to pay its legal fees. The judge called the case ""reckless and wasteful.""The new playing field allows NetApp to spend more on developing its own patents, as opposed to litigation defense. ""It is freeing up dollars,"" said Douglas Luftman, NetApp's chief intellectual property counsel.To be sure, not all litigious patent owning companies are losing ground. Some with court-tested patents are doing well. And not all big tech companies are convinced of the change.Cisco Systems Inc has been at the forefront of the fight against infringement lawsuits and has not seen a drop in new suits in recent months, said General Counsel Mark Chandler.Cisco will continue to push for laws to stop warrantless lawsuits, Chandler said. Others see the need diminishing. THE BIRTH OF TROLLS Big tech companies distinguish between their own intellectual property, which they fiercely protect, and those of their adversaries, which they often dismiss as broadly worded and vague, allowing holders to sue all manner of defendants. The big tech companies note that the patent acquisition companies they label as trolls generally make no products but are solely in the business of buying patents and litigating to enforce them.The putative trolls see a different world. They buy patents from inventors and each other, creating a marketplace that checks big tech companies' sway, and rely ultimately on a fair arbiter: courts. This can provide vital protection for investors' ideas, said Matt Vella, CEO of Acacia Research Corp, which contracts with owners to license their patents to other companies. ""I see it as a Robin Hood function,"" he said.If the so-called trolls had a birth date, it would be the summer of 1994, when a federal appeals court explicitly allowed computer program patents for the first time. In the ensuing years, software patents exploded, covering topics from Wi-Fi to one-click shopping. So did patent lawsuits. Last year, more than 6,000 patent suits were filed, according to intellectual property analytics firm Lex Machina. A 2013 White House report said ""trolls"" were responsible for 60 percent of suits, up from 29 percent in 2010.Congress struck the first blow against these high-volume plaintiffs in an overhaul of the patent system. Starting in 2012, companies accused of infringement could ask the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to invalidate patents used in litigation. The reviews are much cheaper and faster than court.The reviews proved popular -- and devastating for many patent owners. As of June, the patent office was invalidating some or all of challenged patents' claims at a rate of 80 to 90 percent, depending on the type of review.Then, in June of this year, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that a basic idea -- not normally eligible for a patent -- does not become patent-worthy if run on a computer. That case, Alice vs. CLS Bank, has made it easier still to quash software patents, and at least 13 lower court rulings since then have done just that.MOUNTING EVIDENCE  New federal patent lawsuits last month were down 40 percent from the previous year, to 329 cases, data from Lex Machina show.Defendants are also fighting longer, driving up costs for the acquisition companies. In 2004, the median time it took for a case that didn't settle was 467 days. By 2013, that had reached 673 days, according to Lex Machina.Intellectual Ventures, one of the largest private patent buyers, laid off over 20 percent of its workforce this year. The company began with backing from big tech companies who saw it as an ally, but some longtime investors including Apple and Intel declined to participate in its latest funding round. Intellectual Ventures declined to comment.A survey of private patent deals compiled by brokerage IPOfferings, found the average price of a patent was $165,000 in the second quarter of 2014, down from $375,000 in 2012.Some patents have withstood challenges under the new legal rules, however. Marathon Patent Group announced last month that the U.S. government rejected a request by ARM Holdings to invalidate a Marathon patent. Marathon is trading up 28 percent since mid-June.Michael Friedman, managing director at IP strategy firm Ocean Tomo, said patents on widely used technology owned by companies like IBM, Microsoft and Qualcomm, are still in a strong position to seek licenses.But some companies whose business model depends on successful litigation have seen their stock slide since Alice, the 2014 Supreme Court case. InterDigital has fallen over 5 percent and Acacia Research Corp is down over 9 percent. (See graphic: link.reuters.com/rej23w)Just three weeks after Alice was decided, an Acacia Research subsidiary felt its reach when a federal appeals court backed the revocation of a patent on digital image processing, used to sue over 30 tech firms.Acacia is appealing and said that in general, its other patents will not be impacted by Alice in the same way, since few deal with the kinds of software methods Alice puts at risk.Still, Vella, Acacia's CEO, said, said his company sensed the changing legal landscape and is shifting its strategy, away from one-patent cases to challenges based on several patents.

131,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) warned on Wednesday that an antitrust investigation and problems collecting royalties could harm its business in China next year and it also disclosed new regulatory investigations in the United States and Europe.China's expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm's opportunities have been clouded by an 11-month-old antitrust investigation there.Wall Street is worried. Qualcomm could face a fine of more than $1 billion in China as a result of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) investigation, and the company could be forced to make concessions that would hurt its highly profitable business of charging royalties on phones that use its patents.Qualcomm also said it faces a new probe by the European Commission about rebates and other financial incentives in the sale of its chips. Another preliminary investigation by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission concerns a potential breach of licensing terms, the company said.On Wednesday, Qualcomm's shares slid about 6 percent at $72.50 in extended trading from a $77.20 close on the Nasdaq.“We're continuing to cooperate with the NDRC. We’ve continued to meet with them regularly, exchange some ideas for potential ways to resolve it,” Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said in a telephone interview. “But we don't have an ability to update in terms of expectations and timing.” Qualcomm has also been struggling to collect licensing revenue from some device makers in China, including local manufacturers the U.S. chipmaker has done little or no business with in the past.Any concessions on royalties that Qualcomm is forced to make in China could spread to manufacturers in other countries, some investors said.""What people are most worried about is the ability to fence in this issue to Chinese vendors if there’s a reduced royalty rate, or does it spread to other geographies,"" Standard Life portfolio manager Brian Fox said.  Qualcomm said it was difficult to predict the outcome of the U.S. and European investigations. The European probe is separate from a four-year-old complaint to the European Commission from a subsidiary of Nvidia Corp (NVDA.O) over alleged patent-related incentives and exclusionary pricing by Qualcomm.Qualcomm forecast revenue for fiscal 2015 of between $26.8 billion and $28.8 billion.

141,"  * Nvidia sued Samsung, Qualcomm for patent infringement in Sept* Samsung says will defend intellectual property rights   (Updates with comments from Samsung, background)SAN FRANCISCO Nov 11 Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  has accused Nvidia Corp of infringing several of its chip-related patents and for making false claims about its products, counter-suing after Nvidia filed a suit against the Korean company in September.Samsung Electronics, which filed a lawsuit in a U.S. federal court on Nov. 4, is seeking damages for deliberate infringement of several technical patents, including a few that govern the way semiconductors buffer and use data. The South Korean firm, the world's largest smartphone maker, also accuses Nvidia of false advertising when it says its ""Shield"" tablet sports the world's fastest mobile processor, the Tegra. Samsung Electronics cites benchmarking studies performed by researchers at Primate Labs as proving that claim false.""We are pursuing necessary legal measures to defend our intellectual property rights and to ensure our continued growth in the IT industry,"" Samsung Electronics said in an emailed statement. Samsung's lawsuit came after Nvidia accused the Asian company and rival Qualcomm Inc of infringing patents on its graphics-processing unit (GPU). Nvidia vies with Qualcomm in the business of providing chips for smartphones and tablets. The U.S. chipmaker said in September that Qualcomm and Samsung had used Nvidia's patented technologies without a license in Samsung's mobile devices, including the just-launched Galaxy Note 4 and Galaxy Note Edge.""We'll review and respond to these new claims against us, and look forward to presenting our case on how Nvidia GPU patents are being used without a license,"" Nvidia said in a statement on Tuesday.Nvidia also pointed to a benchmarking study that supported its claim that the Tegra was the fastest mobile processor on the market.

142,"   By Michael Gold | TAIPEI  TAIPEI Nov 17 Chips from Taiwan's MediaTek Inc  were mostly passed over by the big phone brands a decade ago, with the likes of Nokia and Motorola commanding legions of in-house engineers who could advise on electronics and circuitry.Fast-forward to the age of the smartphone.The market is heaving with Chinese smartphone makers out to grab share from Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd with low-priced handsets. Sparking the boom in budget smartphones is MediaTek, now a $23 billion go-to chip designer favoured by margin-conscious phone makers.MediaTek pioneered bundling low-cost chips with recommendations on hardware such as lenses and speakers. This ""system-on-chip"" approach saves phone makers the cost of finding and testing parts to match the chips they buy. That in turn allows them to cut prices and, in the past year, seize 10 percentage points of market share from leader Samsung.Thanks in large part to system-on-chip, the average price of a smartphone should fall to $267 by 2018 from $314 now, showed data from researcher IDC. That compared with a U.S. starting price of $749 for the latest Apple iPhone 6 Plus.MediaTek says system-on-chip has won it the patronage of every phone brand bar Samsung and Apple. It helped low-priced smartphone maker Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd become the industry's No.3 in just three years, and is tipped for similar success with Google Inc's Android One in India.""You can think about MediaTek as having a franchise business model, like McDonald's,"" Chief Financial Officer David Ku told Reuters. ""McDonald's gives you all the equipment you need, and the initial cost for you is lower."" MediaTek's system-on-chip strategy has helped the company's market value rise 125 percent to T$715.8 billion ($23.39 billion) in less than three years.The strategy involves collaborating with almost 200 Chinese component makers and handset assemblers to supply MediaTek's smartphone customers with parts compatible with its chips.MediaTek built up its supplier network in the feature phone era. At that time, it says, larger rivals sold chips to big phone makers which would employ thousands of engineers to find and test components such as screens for the chips to operate.""They weren't really interested in doing business with MediaTek,"" Ku said of phone makers. To differentiate, MediaTek began recommending hardware for its chips and targeting companies with limited means of sourcing and testing components independently. That lowered the barrier to enter the phone business, reduced costs and helped handsets reach the market quicker.""The smartphone ecosystem compared with the feature phone ecosystem is very similar, if not the same,"" said Ku. ""It's all well-connected pipes. It doesn't matter what product you pump in.""FABLESS CHIPMAKER MediaTek adds reference designs to basic chip architecture, enabling components to work together. It contracts fabs - or chip factories - to make the chips, which it sells to phone makers along with a list of compatible sensors, microphones and other hardware. It is the list that saves customers money, helping them make smartphones more affordable - particularly in emerging markets such as China, which accounts for 70 to 80 percent of MediaTek sales.Thrifty handset buyers have helped MediaTek sales rise at least 40 percent each month this year, culminating in October's 56 percent. For the full year, it estimates sales of 350 million smartphone ""chipsets"" from just 10 million in 2011.That would amount to 30 percent of the global market, showed Reuters calculations. Fubon Research analyst Carlos Peng estimated nearer 50 percent when excluding chipsets from the likes of Qualcomm Inc and Samsung that are primarily destined for high-priced smartphones.MediaTek's sales spurt is largely due to ""revolutionary"" growth in the value of silicon per handset in function-heavy smartphones versus their far simpler feature phone predecessors, said analyst Rick Hsu at Daiwa Capital Markets in Taipei.""It was a virtually 100 percent increase in silicon value,"" Hsu said. ""It spurred demand for a lot of peripheral chips.""Growth is unlikely to be as marked in the ongoing transition to fourth-generation Long-Term Evolution (4G LTE) connectivity. MediaTek may even struggle with the emergence of 4G in China as it trails Qualcomm in the technology, analysts say.""The first couple of years of LTE could be very much like the early days of 3G (in 2008-2010), or when MediaTek had to play 'catch-up',"" Yuanta Securities analyst George Chang wrote in a research note. That ""usually leads to pricing erosion.""

152,"  SAN FRANCISCO Broadcom (BRCM.O) on Tuesday slightly raised its outlook for fourth-quarter revenue and increased its dividend after abandoning costly competition against Qualcomm (QCOM.O) in baseband cellphone chips.Analysts had expected more details on how Broadcom would return cash to shareholders after deciding in June to exit its money-losing cellular baseband chip business. In a press release, Broadcom said it raised its 2015 quarterly dividend 17 percent to 14 cents per share, and it also announced a $1 billion stock buyback authorization for next year. Shares rose more than 1 percent in extended trade.The company, based in Irvine, California, said it expects fourth-quarter revenue between $2.075 billion and $2.150 billion, with the midpoint of its forecast at $2.11 billion. In October, Broadcom said revenue in the fourth quarter would be $2.0 billion to $2.15 billion, with the midpoint of its forecast at $2.075 billion. As of Tuesday, analysts on average had expected fourth-quarter revenue of $2.064 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Broadcom have surged 34 percent since the company said in June it was deciding how to get out of baseband technology after falling behind in the development of 4G technology increasingly used by carriers.Exiting the business frees up resources to focus on the company's better-performing networking and broadband businesses. But having no 4G product may leave the chipmaker at a competitive disadvantage selling its wifi chips in the smartphone market.

153,"  (New throughout, adds details about dividend, share price, background about forecasts and business plans)SAN FRANCISCO Dec 9 Broadcom on Tuesday slightly raised its outlook for fourth-quarter revenue and increased its dividend after abandoning costly competition against Qualcomm in baseband cellphone chips.Analysts had expected more details on how Broadcom would return cash to shareholders after deciding in June to exit its money-losing cellular baseband chip business.In a press release, Broadcom said it raised its 2015 quarterly dividend 17 percent to 14 cents per share, and it also announced a $1 billion stock buyback authorization for next year. Shares rose more than 1 percent in extended trade. The company, based in Irvine, California, said it expects fourth-quarter revenue between $2.075 billion and $2.150 billion, with the midpoint of its forecast at $2.11 billion.In October, Broadcom said revenue in the fourth quarter would be $2.0 billion to $2.15 billion, with the midpoint of its forecast at $2.075 billion. As of Tuesday, analysts on average had expected fourth-quarter revenue of $2.064 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Broadcom have surged 34 percent since the company said in June it was deciding how to get out of baseband technology after falling behind in the development of 4G technology increasingly used by carriers.Exiting the business frees up resources to focus on the company's better-performing networking and broadband businesses. But having no 4G product may leave the chipmaker at a competitive disadvantage selling its wifi chips in the smartphone market.Shares of Broadcom rose 1.36 percent in extended trade after closing down 2.04 percent.

162,"   By Noel Randewich and Matthew Miller | SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING  SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING The settlement of China's antitrust probe into Qualcomm Inc is likely to intensify global scrutiny of the firm's highly profitable patent licensing business, and may even call into question its worldwide contracts with smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung.China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is moving to wrap up its 13-month investigation into the U.S. chipmaker as soon as possible, the regulator said in a statement on Friday, bringing to an end one of the most high profile of a slew of such investigations by Beijing into western firms.Any deal is likely to include a record-breaking fine, as well as changes to how Qualcomm licenses its technology to handset makers in China, according to industry sources and local press reports.That could weaken the firm's prized technology-licensing business across the global smartphone industry by increasing pressure from regulators in other countries. Anti-trust probes in Europe and by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may be related to China's investigation, Qualcomm has said.""It's not an overstatement to say they're under attack,"" said Thomas Cotter, a patent expert and professor at the University of Minnesota Law School. ""Nobody knows how it will play out but the fact that there is an FTC investigation tells you something.""Qualcomm declined to comment. ROYALTY CHANGES Qualcomm is the top patent holder for cellphone technology, including many that form industry standards like CDMA and LTE. Charging royalties based on the cellphones' selling prices, even those made with competitors' chips, provided more than half of its $8 billion net income in 2014.As growth tapers in developed markets, the smartphone industry has turned to China, where the rollout of LTE technology is driving demand, and where the majority of the world's smartphones are also manufactured.The NDRC, one of China's anti-trust regulators, has said it suspects Qualcomm of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards. Qualcomm is expected by industry sources to agree to changes in how it charges royalties on cellphones sold in China, which will hurt its bottom line in its fastest-growing and most significant market.Qualcomm earned about half of its global revenue of $26.5 billion in China for the fiscal year ended Sept. 28.An agreement to lower royalty rates charged by Qualcomm on phones sold in China could affect its contractual relationships not just with local manufacturers such as Huawei, Lenovo, ZTE and Xiaomi Inc, but also with bigger global players that make and sell phones in China, such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics, said patent lawyers consulted by Reuters.At a meeting with analysts in November, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle did not directly answer a question about when the chipmaker's largest licensees' contracts would be due for renegotiation, or how those renegotiations would be affected by potential concessions Qualcomm could make in China.

163,"   By Noel Randewich and Matthew Miller | SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING  SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING The settlement of China's anti-trust probe into Qualcomm Inc is likely to intensify global scrutiny of the firm's highly profitable patent licensing business, and may even call into question its worldwide contracts with smartphone makers such as Apple and Samsung.China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is moving to wrap up its 13-month investigation into the U.S. chipmaker as soon as possible, the regulator said in a statement on Friday, bringing to an end one of the most high profile of a slew of such investigations by Beijing into western firms.Any deal is likely to include a record-breaking fine, as well as changes to how Qualcomm licenses its technology to handset makers in China, according to industry sources and local press reports.That could weaken the firm's prized technology-licensing business across the global smartphone industry by increasing pressure from regulators in other countries. Anti-trust probes in Europe and by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) may be related to China's investigation, Qualcomm has said.""It's not an overstatement to say they're under attack,"" said Thomas Cotter, a patent expert and professor at the University of Minnesota Law School.

Charging royalties based on the cellphones' selling prices, even those made with competitors' chips, provided more than half of its $8 billion net income in 2014.As growth tapers in developed markets, the smartphone industry has turned to China, where the rollout of LTE technology is driving demand, and where the majority of the world's smartphones are also manufactured.The NDRC, one of China's anti-trust regulators, has said it suspects Qualcomm of overcharging and abusing its market position in wireless communication standards.Qualcomm is expected by industry sources to agree to changes in how it charges royalties on cellphones sold in China, which will hurt its bottom line in its fastest-growing and most significant market. Qualcomm earned about half of its global revenue of $26.5 billion in China for the fiscal year ended Sept. 28.An agreement to lower royalty rates charged by Qualcomm on phones sold in China could affect its contractual relationships not just with local manufacturers such as Huawei, Lenovo, ZTE and Xiaomi Inc, but also with bigger global players that make and sell phones in China, such as Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics, said patent lawyers consulted by Reuters.At a meeting with analysts in November, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle did not directly answer a question about when the chipmaker's largest licensees' contracts would be due for renegotiation, or how those renegotiations would be affected by potential concessions Qualcomm could make in China.""If Qualcomm comes to an agreement with China's government to materially reduce its royalty rates, then what happens with their agreements with LG, Samsung and Apple?"" said Ascendiant Capital analyst Cody Acree.

180,"   By Noel Randewich and Matthew Miller | SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING  SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) has agreed to pay China a fine of $975 million, the largest in the country's corporate history, ending a 14-month government investigation into anti-competitive practices.The deal also requires Qualcomm to lower its royalty rates on patents used in China, likely helping Chinese smartphone makers like Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd [XTC.UL] and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. It removes a major source of concern among Qualcomm investors, sending shares of the U.S. chipmaker up 1.6 percent to $68.18 in after-hours trading.    China's expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm's opportunities have been clouded by the antitrust investigation, which has also contributed to troubles collecting royalty payments from device makers.Qualcomm said in a statement on Monday it would not contest the China's National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) finding that Qualcomm violated an antitrust law. Asked whether the resolution in China could affect the outcome of ongoing antitrust probes into Qualcomm in Europe and the United States, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said, ""We fully respect their authority, but we don’t believe it’s likely that other agencies will necessarily meet similar conclusions.""The U.S. chipmaker also cut its full-year earnings estimate because of the fine, which Qualcomm said would cost it about 58 cents per share, but it raised the lower end of its revenue forecast slightly. “It removes a significant source of uncertainly from our business and really positions our licensing group to really participate in the full growth of the wireless market in China,” Qualcomm Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf told Reuters in a phone interview. “It’s something we’re happy is over.” Discussions in Beijing over one of the most contentious cases under China's 2008 anti-monopoly law had intensified in recent weeks, culminating in meetings between Qualcomm senior executives and the NDRC on Friday. Under the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm will offer licenses to its current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents - widely used by Chinese device makers - separately from other patents. For companies opting for the new agreement, which applies to phones sold for use in China, Qualcomm will calculate royalties based on 65 percent of the selling price of phones, instead of on the whole price.  Some on Wall Street have speculated that even limited concessions made to Qualcomm's licensing business in China could affect the technology company's licensing deals in other countries.""That's the first time I've ever seen them in writing agree to that and it begs the question of why 65 percent is the right number in China and it's not the right number everywhere,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.As a result of the fine, Qualcomm said it now expects full-year earnings per share of between $3.56 and $3.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with its prior forecast of $4.04 to $4.34. It raised its fiscal 2015 revenue forecast to a range of $26.3 billion to $28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its last forecast of $26 billion to $28 billion. Excluding the cost of the fine and other one-time items, Qualcomm forecast earnings of $4.85 to $5.05 per share, raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $4.75 to $5.05. On that basis, analysts had expected $4.96 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

191,"   By Noel Randewich and Matthew Miller | SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING  SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING Qualcomm Inc has agreed to pay a fine of $975 million, the largest in China's corporate history, ending a 14-month government investigation into anti-competitive practices.The deal - the details of which were first reported by Reuters on Monday - also requires Qualcomm to lower its royalty rates on patents used in China, likely helping local smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.Qualcomm said the agreement removes a major source of concern for its investors, sending shares of the San Diego-based chipmaker up 2.8 percent to $69 in after-hours trading.China's expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm's opportunities have been clouded by the antitrust probe, which has also contributed to problems in collecting royalty payments from device makers.Qualcomm said in a statement on Monday it would not contest the National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) finding that it violated an antitrust law.Asked whether the resolution in China could affect the outcome of ongoing antitrust probes into Qualcomm in Europe and the United States, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said, ""We fully respect their authority, but we don't believe it's likely that other agencies will necessarily meet similar conclusions.""The U.S. firm cut its full-year earnings estimate, putting the cost of the fine at about 58 cents per share, but it raised the lower end of its revenue forecast slightly. ""It removes a significant source of uncertainly from our business and positions our licensing group to really participate in the full growth of the wireless market in China,"" CEO Steve Mollenkopf said in a phone interview. ""It's something we're happy is over."" FINE COULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER Discussions in Beijing over one of the most contentious cases under China's 2008 anti-monopoly law had intensified in recent weeks, culminating in meetings between Qualcomm senior executives and the NDRC on Friday.Xu Kunlin, head of the NDRC's anti-monopoly bureau, said the $975 million fine - equal to 8 percent of Qualcomm's 2013 sales in China - was less than the 10 percent of sales maximum allowed under Chinese law because Qualcomm fully cooperated with investigators. ""Issuing the fine was not our primary purpose,"" Xu told reporters on Tuesday, according to a Sina.com live-blog of his remarks. ""Our purpose was to restore orderly, free-market competition. Qualcomm's practices had stifled innovation.""Under the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm will offer licenses to its current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents, widely used by Chinese device makers, separately from other patents. For companies opting for the new agreement, which applies to phones sold for use in China, Qualcomm will calculate royalties based on 65 percent of the phone's selling price, instead of on the whole price.Some on Wall Street have speculated that even limited concessions made to Qualcomm's licensing business in China could affect the technology company's licensing deals elsewhere.""That's the first time I've ever seen them in writing agree to that and it begs the question of why 65 percent is the right number in China and it's not the right number everywhere,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.As a result of the fine, Qualcomm said it now expects full-year earnings per share of $3.56-$3.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with a prior forecast of $4.04-$4.34. It raised its fiscal 2015 revenue forecast to $26.3-$28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $26-$28 billion.Excluding the cost of the fine and other one-time items, Qualcomm forecast earnings of $4.85-$5.05 per share, raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $4.75-$5.05. On that basis, analysts had expected $4.96 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Qualcomm is one of several overseas companies, including Microsoft Corp, to come under investigation in China for allegedly anti-competitive practises.

192,"   By Robyn Mak | HONG KONG  HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - China has held back with its Qualcomm settlement. The country's antitrust watchdogs hit the U.S. chipmaker with a $975 million fine on Feb. 9 and forced it to lower patent fees. That's helpful for local smartphone makers that rely on Qualcomm's third and fourth generation mobile technology. Yet the resolution stopped short of explicitly curbing the tech giant's dominance in the country. Big as China is, it can't yet afford to shut out foreign technology.The one-off fine may be the largest in China's corporate history, but the $117 billion tech group can afford to take the hit: Qualcomm is debt-free and held $32 billion worth of cash and securities at the end of December. But Beijing's order for Qualcomm to price its royalties based on 65 percent of the selling price of a phone, rather than the whole price, will leave a bruise. Assuming 30 percent of the company's China revenue in the last fiscal year comes from patents - in line with Qualcomm's global ratio - a 35 percent reduction in royalties collected would have slashed the group's revenue last year by $1.4 billion.Yet China's antitrust watchdogs have left some leeway for Qualcomm to play tough with its customers. Unlike in Japan or South Korea, Beijing did not explicitly ban the company from ""cross-licensing"" - where Qualcomm requires clients to make their patents freely available to the chipmaker and its other customers - or from bundling chip sales with license agreements. Rather, Qualcomm has committed to negotiating with Chinese companies ""in good faith"". The lack of detail raises the risk Chinese regulators will flex their interpretation of ""good faith"", but there's scope for Qualcomm to retain its dominance and market share.A likely explanation for the relative lenience is China's reliance on foreign technology. The country has been aggressively ramping up next generation mobile networks: shipments of 4G smartphones in China will hit 422 million by 2017, up from 152 million last year according to IDC. But more than 90 percent of chips are imported, which means even more reliance on foreign companies for expanding 4G networks. Beijing's regulators may have a lot of weight, but Qualcomm is still very much in the game. CONTEXT NEWS - U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm announced that it has reached a resolution with China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) on Feb. 9, ending a 14-month investigation into anti-competitive practices. The NDRC is China's top economic planning body and also regulates prices and market dominance under China's anti-monopoly law. - Under the agreement, Qualcomm will pay China a fine of $975 million for violating China's anti-monopoly law and modify some of its business practices in a ""rectification plan"". Specifically, the company will change the way it charges royalties from smartphone manufacturers for its third and fourth generation cellular technology. Qualcomm has also committed to negotiating its licensing and chip sales agreements with Chinese manufacturers fairly and reasonably.- Qualcomm raised its forecast revenue for fiscal 2015 to a range of $26.3 billion to $28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its last forecast of $26 billion to $28 billion, as a result of the agreement. - Qualcomm reported revenue of $7.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015, a 7 percent increase from the same period last year on Jan. 29.

195,"   By Se Young Lee | SEOUL  SEOUL As Samsung Electronics Co Ltd sells fewer of its own smartphones, the South Korean group's components businesses are under pressure to pick up the slack and secure external customers for chips and display panels, including putting these in rival mobile devices. Samsung Display has begun supplying organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels to Chinese smartphone makers Lenovo, Coolpad, Oppo Electronics and Vivo Electronics. And the subsidiary says it's on the lookout for more clients, aiming to have half its total revenue by 2017 from sales to outside customers, up from just over a third in 2013.Industry officials estimate that external clients account for around a fifth of Samsung Display's sales of smaller smartphone and tablet panels compared to about 50 percent for large panels for TVs, underscoring a need for more mobile clients.""Samsung Display's desire to grow overseas sales wasn't as strong when Samsung Electronics' Galaxy S devices were selling well, but now it's trying to avoid being too over-reliant on a single client,"" a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Samsung's systems chips business is also trying to grow its customer base following a weak 2014. Some analysts say the business lost more than $1 billion last year on declining sales of Galaxy smartphones and the loss of a contract to supply the processor for Apple Inc's iPhone 6.Samsung's next Galaxy S smartphone is widely expected to be powered by its own Exynos processor chips after Qualcomm Inc acknowledged that a key customer won't use its Snapdragon mobile chip in a flagship device.Samsung has declined to comment on that, but another individual familiar with the matter said the proportion of next-generation Galaxy S phones powered by Exynos chips will likely increase from previous versions.   A successful launch of the new device could help win more external orders, and bolster profits. Samsung said late last month it was in talks with third-party customers about supplying its Exynos mobile processors.""Some of Samsung's components businesses and other affiliates were too dependent on the captive (in-house) market,"" said IM Investment analyst Lee Min-hee.

196,"  (Adds link to TV clip)By Se Young LeeSEOUL Feb 10 As Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  sells fewer of its own smartphones, the South Korean group's components businesses are under pressure to pick up the slack and secure external customers for chips and display panels, including putting these in rival mobile devices.Samsung Display has begun supplying organic light-emitting diode (OLED) panels to Chinese smartphone makers Lenovo , Coolpad, Oppo Electronics and Vivo Electronics. And the subsidiary says it's on the lookout for more clients, aiming to have half its total revenue by 2017 from sales to outside customers, up from just over a third in 2013.Industry officials estimate that external clients account for around a fifth of Samsung Display's sales of smaller smartphone and tablet panels compared to about 50 percent for large panels for TVs, underscoring a need for more mobile clients.""Samsung Display's desire to grow overseas sales wasn't as strong when Samsung Electronics' Galaxy S devices were selling well, but now it's trying to avoid being too over-reliant on a single client,"" a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Samsung's systems chips business is also trying to grow its customer base following a weak 2014. Some analysts say the business lost more than $1 billion last year on declining sales of Galaxy smartphones and the loss of a contract to supply the processor for Apple Inc's iPhone 6.Samsung's next Galaxy S smartphone is widely expected to be powered by its own Exynos processor chips after Qualcomm Inc  acknowledged that a key customer won't use its Snapdragon mobile chip in a flagship device. Samsung has declined to comment on that, but another individual familiar with the matter said the proportion of next-generation Galaxy S phones powered by Exynos chips will likely increase from previous versions.A successful launch of the new device could help win more external orders, and bolster profits. Samsung said late last month it was in talks with third-party customers about supplying its Exynos mobile processors.""Some of Samsung's components businesses and other affiliates were too dependent on the captive (in-house) market,"" said IM Investment analyst Lee Min-hee.

197,"   By Noel Randewich and Matthew Miller | SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING  SAN FRANCISCO/BEIJING Qualcomm Inc has agreed to pay a fine of $975 million, the largest in China's corporate history, ending a 14-month government investigation into anti-competitive practices.The deal - the details of which were first reported by Reuters on Monday - also requires Qualcomm to lower its royalty rates on patents used in China, likely helping local smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Technology Co Ltd [XTC.UL] and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL]. Qualcomm said the agreement removes a major source of concern for its investors, sending shares of the San Diego-based chipmaker up 2.8 percent to $69 in after-hours trading.China's expanding high-speed 4G network is driving demand for smartphones with leading-edge technology, but Qualcomm's opportunities have been clouded by the antitrust probe, which has also contributed to problems in collecting royalty payments from device makers.Qualcomm said in a statement on Monday it would not contest the National Development and Reform Commission's (NDRC) finding that it violated an antitrust law. Asked whether the resolution in China could affect the outcome of ongoing antitrust probes into Qualcomm in Europe and the United States, Qualcomm President Derek Aberle said, ""We fully respect their authority, but we don't believe it's likely that other agencies will necessarily meet similar conclusions.""The U.S. firm cut its full-year earnings estimate, putting the cost of the fine at about 58 cents per share, but it raised the lower end of its revenue forecast slightly. ""It removes a significant source of uncertainly from our business and positions our licensing group to really participate in the full growth of the wireless market in China,"" CEO Steve Mollenkopf said in a phone interview. ""It's something we're happy is over.""FINE COULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER Discussions in Beijing over one of the most contentious cases under China's 2008 anti-monopoly law had intensified in recent weeks, culminating in meetings between Qualcomm senior executives and the NDRC on Friday. Xu Kunlin, head of the NDRC's anti-monopoly bureau, said the $975 million fine - equal to 8 percent of Qualcomm's 2013 sales in China - was less than the 10 percent of sales maximum allowed under Chinese law because Qualcomm fully cooperated with investigators.""Issuing the fine was not our primary purpose,"" Xu told reporters on Tuesday, according to a Sina.com live-blog of his remarks. ""Our purpose was to restore orderly, free-market competition. Qualcomm's practices had stifled innovation.""Under the terms of the agreement, Qualcomm will offer licenses to its current 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents, widely used by Chinese device makers, separately from other patents. For companies opting for the new agreement, which applies to phones sold for use in China, Qualcomm will calculate royalties based on 65 percent of the phone's selling price, instead of on the whole price.  Some on Wall Street have speculated that even limited concessions made to Qualcomm's licensing business in China could affect the technology company's licensing deals elsewhere.""That's the first time I've ever seen them in writing agree to that and it begs the question of why 65 percent is the right number in China and it's not the right number everywhere,"" said Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon.As a result of the fine, Qualcomm said it now expects full-year earnings per share of $3.56-$3.76 for fiscal 2015, compared with a prior forecast of $4.04-$4.34. It raised its fiscal 2015 revenue forecast to $26.3-$28 billion, slightly raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $26-$28 billion.Excluding the cost of the fine and other one-time items, Qualcomm forecast earnings of $4.85-$5.05 per share, raising the lower end of its previous forecast of $4.75-$5.05. On that basis, analysts had expected $4.96 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Qualcomm is one of several overseas companies, including Microsoft Corp, to come under investigation in China for allegedly anti-competitive practises.

Such a view has helped fuel a stock market surge of nearly 30 percent in the last few months, though the rally has shown signs of flagging in recent weeks as more firms issue profit warnings. ""We're seeing a technical rebound as expectations of further policy support help stabilise the market,"" said Shen Zhengyang, analyst at Northeast Securities.""But we don't see fresh capital flowing in as the market doesn't guarantee red envelopes ahead of the Lunar New Year,"" he added, referring to the customary gifts of cash in red packets for the holiday.The CSI300 index ended the morning session up 0.6 percent at 3,426.22 points, while the Shanghai Composite Index  was up 0.2 percent. But Hong Kong shares fell, with the Hang Seng index  down 0.8 percent and the Hong Kong China Enterprises Index  marginally weaker.Trading volumes in Shanghai remained thin, after hitting a fresh three-month low on Tuesday, as many investors await clues on whether the economy is bottoming out.Although the market expects fresh monetary easing measures  - China International Capital Corp forecast another interest rate reduction and three reserve ratio cuts ahead - analysts said they are aimed at bolstering the economy, rather than the stock market. In a sign of waning interest in stocks, the number of new trading accounts opened last week totalled 384,800, down nearly 20 percent from the previous week, according to the China Securities Journal.Software and telecom stocks climbed on Wednesday, as investors bet the $1 billion anti-trust fine China slapped on U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc would benefit domestic rivals.

""That's the real significance of the (Qualcomm) settlement.""The competitive dynamics are particularly complex in China, the world's biggest smartphone manufacturer and consumer, as large Chinese telecom equipment makers that hold many essential patents for wireless technology also compete in the phone market against younger, nimbler manufacturers.The settlement could prove tricky for companies like Xiaomi Inc, a 4-year-old Beijing-based smartphone maker whose weak patent position has proved a major vulnerability.

His stockbroker, former Merrill Lynch vice president Gary Yin, pleaded guilty to money laundering, officials said.Sentencing hearings for Wang and Yin have yet to be scheduled, the statement said.Cohen, who has agreed to forfeit the $200,000 he gained to the U.S. government, faces maximum penalties of 20 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Sentencing is scheduled for May 22.

207,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Honeywell International Inc said on Monday it has teamed up with satellite internet startup OneWeb Ltd to expand the high-speed data services it offers to aircraft.OneWeb, whose investors include Richard Branson's Virgin Group and Qualcomm Inc, plans to build a network of 648 low-orbit satellites capable of beaming fast internet around the world starting in 2019.Honeywell will use OneWeb's bandwidth to provide aircraft services such as streaming maintenance data from engines and other equipment to the ground, transmitting weather and navigation data to pilots and supplying fast internet connections to passengers. The system also could stream black box flight data or cockpit video, ideas regulators are discussing, Honeywell said.Honeywell already supplies some services through satellite providers such as Iridium Communications Inc and Inmarsat Plc. But the faster speeds and low latency that OneWeb promises - at least 50 megabits per second per aircraft, and possibly much more - could in theory increase Honeywell's market by three to five times, Carl Esposito, vice president of marketing and product management at Honeywell Aerospace, said in an interview.    ""It's a big opportunity,"" he said. Because of the high bandwidth, ""it really is transformational across the entire aircraft.""  The deal does not rule out or alter other partnerships.""It is very complementary to the solutions we're already providing,"" he said.Honeywell will also sell equipment that connects the aircraft to the satellite.  Honeywell says the agreement will allow it to target a wider range of aircraft, including smaller business and military planes, along with commercial jetliners.OneWeb says its system will be capable of providing 10 terabits of data per second, and much of that bandwidth will go to ground-based users in developing countries seeking internet access. Aircraft add another, potentially lucrative market, although the prices of OneWeb and Honeywell's services have not been set. OneWeb does not see a threat from other technology companies that provide global broadband such as Facebook Inc, Google Inc and SpaceX. ""There's an insane appetite for bandwidth,"" Chief Executive Officer Greg Wyler said. ""We're going to make a dent in it with our system. But we're not going to complete it.""OneWeb plans to start launching its small satellites in 2017, placing them about 750 miles above Earth. The satellites will weigh 275 pounds (125 kilograms) and will be built with a partner. The satellite and launch partners have not been announced. (Additional reporting by Alexei Oreskovic.

219,"   By Se Young Lee and Noel Randewich | SEOUL/SAN FRANCISCO  SEOUL/SAN FRANCISCO Samsung Electronics Co Ltd used more of its own chips to power the new Galaxy S6 smartphone than it did for the predecessor S5, according to an early teardown report, in a blow to U.S. chip supplier Qualcomm Inc. Samsung is not only using its own Exynos mobile processor, as had been widely reported, but also decided to rely on its in-house semiconductor business to source other parts, including the modem and power management integrated circuit chips, Ottawa-based consultancy Chipworks said in a web posting dated April 2.Samsung is counting on its new flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 edge phones to help revive earnings momentum after a disappointing 2014. Strong sales of system chips such as its Exynos processor could also help boost earnings, analysts and investors say.The Galaxy S6 also comes with Samsung's Shannon modem chip, U.S. phone carrier AT&T said on its website. ""It's pretty clear if they're using Shannon for the modem for AT&T that they're trying to use all-Samsung silicon,"" said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. ""With their market share going down they're under pressure to increase profit margins.""The findings suggest a deeper loss of business for Qualcomm in the new generation of Samsung's flagship handsets than anticipated previously. Teardown reports of the predecessor Galaxy S5, released last year, showed the U.S. chipmaker supplied several components that Samsung has supplanted with its own this year, based on the phone Chipworks investigated.   Qualcomm said in January that a key customer declined to use its new Snapdragon processor in an upcoming flagship phone presumed to be Samsung's Galaxy S6. But it had been unclear whether Samsung would drop Qualcomm's modem chips as well. Qualcomm is the industry leader in LTE, the most advanced modem technology, but Samsung, Intel, MediaTek and others have developing their own offerings.

220,"   By Se Young Lee and Noel Randewich | SEOUL/SAN FRANCISCO, April 3  SEOUL/SAN FRANCISCO, April 3 Samsung Electronics Co Ltd used more of its own chips to power the new Galaxy S6 smartphone than it did for the predecessor S5, according to an early teardown report, in a blow to U.S. chip supplier Qualcomm Inc.Samsung is not only using its own Exynos mobile processor, as had been widely reported, but also decided to rely on its in-house semiconductor business to source other parts, including the modem and power management integrated circuit chips, Ottawa-based consultancy Chipworks said in a web posting dated April 2.Samsung is counting on its new flagship Galaxy S6 and S6 edge phones to help revive earnings momentum after a disappointing 2014. Strong sales of system chips such as its Exynos processor could also help boost earnings, analysts and investors say. The Galaxy S6 also comes with Samsung's Shannon modem chip, U.S. phone carrier AT&T said on its website.""It's pretty clear if they're using Shannon for the modem for AT&T that they're trying to use all-Samsung silicon,"" said Jim McGregor, an analyst at Tirias Research. ""With their market share going down they're under pressure to increase profit margins."" The findings suggest a deeper loss of business for Qualcomm in the new generation of Samsung's flagship handsets than anticipated previously. Teardown reports of the predecessor Galaxy S5, released last year, showed the U.S. chipmaker supplied several components that Samsung has supplanted with its own this year, based on the phone Chipworks investigated. Qualcomm said in January that a key customer declined to use its new Snapdragon processor in an upcoming flagship phone presumed to be Samsung's Galaxy S6. But it had been unclear whether Samsung would drop Qualcomm's modem chips as well.Qualcomm is the industry leader in LTE, the most advanced modem technology, but Samsung, Intel, MediaTek  and others have developing their own offerings.Samsung and Qualcomm did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

The rise of 126,000 jobs was well below economists' expectations for a gain of 245,000.* The jobs data was released on Good Friday, when Wall Street was closed. Major European markets were closed from Friday through Monday for the Easter holiday, and were set to reopen Tuesday. * The weak data eased some concerns that the U.S. dollar would continue to strengthen and further pressure earnings of companies with international exposure. It also pushed expectations of a rate hike from the Federal Reserve further down the road.* However, investors are concerned that a patch of soft economic data, including jobs, factory activity and consumer spending, may point to more than a weather-related slowdown and could indicate a loss of momentum in the U.S. economy.* Separate readings on the U.S. services sector, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of the country's economic activity, are due shortly after the opening bell.

222,"  * Seeks to resolve supply issues for curved model quickly* Says could use Qualcomm chips in future products* Plans new wearable devices   (Adds comments from executives, analysts, background)By Se Young LeeSEOUL, April 9 Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  expects record shipments for its new Galaxy S6 smartphones and said it will struggle to meet demand for the curved-edged version due to production constraints, adding to hopes for a turnaround in mobile sales.The S6 models are widely expected to sell briskly following a string of positive reviews, boosting prospects for an earnings recovery in 2015. This week, the company estimated its January-March operating profit to be its highest in three quarters, which analysts said was partly because Samsung put its own chips in the new phones.Samsung expects the flat screen S6 to sell more than the higher-margin S6 edge - priced about $120 more in South Korea - but mobile chief J.K. Shin said at a media event on Thursday the firm won't be able to keep up with demand for the latter model in the near term because the curved screens are harder to manufacture. ""Some carriers are switching existing orders to get more of the S6 edge, and it looks like demand for the model will exceed supply throughout this year,"" said HMC Investment analyst Greg Roh. ""That means average selling price will fall at a slower rate, which will have a positive impact on Samsung overall.""Samsung has not disclosed its shipment record for a handset. Analysts regard the Galaxy S3 as its best-selling model overall, though they estimate the Galaxy S4 to have done better in its initial year, when a model is most profitable.Nomura estimated that Samsung sold 80 million S3s in three years from its 2012 launch, and 43 million S4s from the model's April 2013 launch to the end of that year. Some analysts say Samsung could ship 50 million or more S6 phones this year. Samsung's Shin also said the South Korean electronics maker is preparing a variety of wearable devices, including a new version of its Gear smartwatch, but did not give specifics. Arch-rival Apple Inc is due to roll out its much-anticipated smartwatch on April 24. QUALCOMM STILL A PARTNER Shin acknowledged that Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from U.S.-based Qualcomm Inc.Samsung previously relied heavily on Qualcomm chips for its flagship phones, but recent reports based on dismantling Samsung's handsets showed the firm replaced many Qualcomm chips with its own. Shin said the companies remain close partners.""We have to use the best engines to make our products competitive, which is why we opted to use our own chips,"" Shin said. ""But we may very well end up using products from Qualcomm again in the next Galaxy phone.""The new Galaxy devices go on sale in 20 countries on Friday.

223,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch  U.S. stocks dipped on Monday as fears increased that the strong dollar and lower oil prices will hurt U.S. first-quarter earnings.Nine of the 10 S&P 500 sectors fell, led by a 1.1 percent decline in S&P industrials. Shares of General Electric Co dropped 3.1 percent to $27.63 after rallying on Friday, when the company said it may return more than $90 billion to investors through 2018. Shares of 3M Co were down 0.7 percent at $165.84.The dollar was last up 0.1 percent against a basket of major currencies after hitting a peak of 99.99, its highest in four weeks. A stronger dollar tends to hurt profits for U.S. multinationals. U.S. crude oil prices edged higher, but their  sharp decline since last year has weighed on energy companies' results.Corporate earnings kick into high gear this week. Estimates for first-quarter S&P 500 results have fallen sharply since Jan. 1, with earnings for the period expected to have declined 2.9 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed.""There is some trepidation about what the earnings announcements are going to look like, and so investors are cautious,"" said John Carey, portfolio manager at Pioneer Investment Management in Boston. ""Most people are thinking earnings are going to be weak due the strong dollar, lower oil prices and sluggish consumer spending due to the winter weather. But we'll see."" Among the companies expected to report this week are GE, Intel Corp and Johnson & Johnson, whose shares fell 1.5 percent to $100.55 on Monday. Several big banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co  and Bank of America Corp , also are due to report.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 80.61 points, or 0.45 percent, to 17,977.04; the S&P 500 dropped 9.63 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,092.43, and the Nasdaq Composite eased 7.73 points, or 0.15 percent, to 4,988.25.The Nasdaq briefly traded above 5,000, within 110 points of its all-time intraday high.

Netflix Inc shares rose 4.4 percent at $474.68.

233,"  (Adds investor reaction to Fink letter)By Jessica ToonkelNEW YORK, April 14 BlackRock Inc chief Larry Fink has asked the top executives of the 500 largest publicly listed U.S. companies urging them to take a long-term approach to create value for shareholders or risk losing his firm's support.In a letter to the chief executive officers of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, Fink asked the companies to avoid short-term pressures created by the increasing activist shareholder activity of recent years.""It is critical ... to understand that corporate leaders' duty of care and loyalty is not to every investor or trader who owns their companies' shares at any moment in time, but to the company and its long term owners,"" Fink wrote in the letter, dated March 31.BlackRock is the world's largest asset manager. At the end of 2014, it had $4.65 trillion of assets under management.In 2014, dividends and buybacks in the United States totaled $900 billion, the highest ever, according to the letter. Through March, buyback authorizations totaled $257 billion, the fastest start to any year on record, according to Birinyi Associates.Many market analysts expect that a rise in interest rates will not derail the buyback boom bolstering stocks.The company made Fink's letter available to Reuters after The New York Times first reported on the document on Monday evening, ahead of the company's scheduled release of first-quarter results on Thursday. Given the low interest rate environment, such moves ""send a discouraging message about a company's ability to use its resources wisely and develop a coherent plan to create value over the long-term,"" Fink wroteCorporate boards should act as ""the first line of defense"" against short-term pressures.""In the last two years, activists have taken positions in some of the largest U.S. corporations seeking larger share repurchases, divestitures or other corporate action. The companies targeted included Apple Inc, General Motors Co, DuPont and Qualcomm Inc.Hank Smith, chief investment officer of Haverford Trust Co, which has $8.2 billion in assets under management, disagrees with Fink and believes most activists now are more long-term than the corporate raiders of the 1980s. ""I think the majority of activist investors today are really investors and are not going into this to slash and burn,"" Smith told Reuters in an interview Tuesday afternoon.For example, Smith applauded Nelson Peltz' Trian Fund Management LP for taking a long-term approach with its campaign against the management of chemicals and agricultural company DuPont.Trian is pushing the company's board to be more accountable and argues it should be split in two. The fund is pushing for four seats on DuPont's board.""I think Trian represents a positive influence,"" he said. Smith also disagrees with Fink that dividends are a sign  companies are thinking short-term.""Dividends are the mother's milk of returns to investors,"" said Smith, who only invests in companies that pay them. ""Dividend increases are the most tangible statement management can make about the firm's fundamentals and future prospects.""For its part, BlackRock has revised its proxy guidelines to highlight it expects board members to protect shareholders against short-term thinking.Firms that have a long-term strategy to create shareholder value, as well as credible metrics to assess performance, will have BlackRock's support during periods of underperformance.""In such cases, we will take action to ensure that the owners' interest are effectively served,"" he wrote.Dan Fuss, vice chairman of Loomis Sayles and known as the Warren Buffett of bonds, shared Fink's sentiments.""In a number of cases, in the tech area among the most prominent of the examples, is where you ought to be reinvesting in the business,"" he said. ""There's too much catering to quarterly earnings engineering slash activist shareholders.""    (Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan.

234,"  * Revenue likely to fall 7-8 pct from Q1* Forecast comes after client Qualcomm's chips dropped by Samsung* Q1 net rises 65 pct to T$79 bln, beats estimates   (Adds revenue outlook, industry outlook, executive comments)By Michael GoldTAIPEI, April 16 Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC)  on Thursday said revenue is likely to fall in the second quarter from the first, due in part to the loss of business at one of its key customers.The world's largest contract chip manufacturer expects a decline of 7 percent to 8 percent in April-June. In the three months prior, revenue was flat on quarter but grew 50 percent on year, pushing net profit beyond analyst estimates.The forecast comes a week after rival Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said it used its own chips in its just-released flagship smartphone instead of chips from Qualcomm Inc, which contracts a large share of its production to TSMC. ""A key customer's business loss to an IDM ... will negatively impact our business,"" TSMC Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho said in a quarterly analyst conference, without identifying the IDM or the customer.IDM refers to companies like Samsung which both design and manufacture chips, unlike TSMC which only manufactures them.The development follows TSMC's presumed loss of orders to Samsung for chips for Apple Inc's next iPhone, likely due out this year, analysts said. Estimates for TSMC's share in the handset's next iteration range from 30 percent to 50 percent, from as much as 100 percent in the iPhone 6 models. At the lower end of the smartphone market, declining prices worldwide may drive handset makers to opt for smaller players such as Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp  and United Microelectronics Corp which offer more competitive prices for less-advanced technology, analysts said.SLOWING MARKET  TSMC said the chip industry - from design to manufacturing and testing - is likely to grow 4 percent this year, rather than 5 percent forecast in January, and that revenue growth in manufacturing alone will be more 10 percent than 12 percent.""Emerging countries' demand for low-end smartphones is relatively weak"" in the short-term, said spokeswoman Elizabeth Sun. ""We're also seeing some delay in the launch of high-end phones from Android brands other than Samsung.""TSMC also sliced $1 billion from its capital expenditure plan for 2015, largely attributed to improved efficiency rather than weak demand.For the three months through March, TSMC said net profit rose 65 percent to T$79 billion ($2.54 billion), beating the T$77.8 billion average estimate of 22 analysts polled by Reuters.Ahead of the earnings, TSMC shares closed up 2.8 percent versus a 1.2 percent rise in the overall TAIEX index.

The company also reported a quarterly revenue rise of 49.8 percent, as devices from watches to washing machines require more chips.Shares of TSMC closed up 2.8 percent ahead of the earnings release, versus a 1.2 percent rise in the overall TAIEX  index. Company-watchers are skittish about the firm's future as competition intensifies to produce the smallest, most energy-efficient chips against rivals Samsung Electronics Co Ltd  and Intel Corp.Most agree TSMC lost orders to Samsung to produce chips for Apple's next-generation iPhone, likely due out this year.

236,"   By Danielle Robinson  NEW YORK, April 17 (IFR) - Hedge fund pressure to break up Qualcomm is not likely to be an obstacle when the world's largest phone chip-maker comes to market as expected with a jumbo bond to finance a share buyback.Activist hedge fund Jana Partners, which holds 4.4 million shares in Qualcomm, wants it to split its chip-making business from its technology-licensing operation, among other changes.But with A1/A+ ratings, no debt outstanding and some US$32bn of cash on hand, Qualcomm is highly unlikely to take heed - and investors are expected to shrug off Jana's complaints as well.""Qualcomm is a US$113bn company,"" said Matt Duch, senior portfolio manager at Calvert Investments.""So I'm sure the (buy-side) response is: they are too big for Jana to really influence management decisions.""Jana is widely seen as the biggest and toughest of all hedge fund activists, and typically its involvement would spell nothing but trouble for a company.Moreover, its gripes about Qualcomm's recent performance are understandable.Qualcomm shares have slumped almost 9% year-to-date, and the company is facing intense competition from the likes of Samsung, MediaTek and Intel.""We believe that the board and management recognise the need to address its historical underperformance and improve investor perceptions of the company,"" Jana said this week, calling Qualcomm's chip business ""essentially worthless"" at current valuations.But with its strong ratings and lack of debt, Qualcomm has the ability to issue tens of billions of dollars of bonds for shareholder-friendly actions - and still remain single A rated with cash to spare. ""As a bondholder you're always concerned that a company may pursue more aggressive financial policies to boost shareholder returns,"" said Scott Kimball, portfolio manager at Taplin, Canida & Habacht.""But an inaugural issuance in the A rated technology bucket by a company with no debt outstanding would appeal to a wide audience.""With demand for high-quality corporates increasing with every drop in government bond yields worldwide, investors are more willing to accept bonds that mitigate risks with covenants.""In this market, Qualcomm could structure the bond issuance with strong covenants (change of control language, limitations on leverage and subordination) and enough credit spread to overcome the Jana Partners overhang,"" said Kimball.""In fact, one could argue that debt with heavy covenants limits Jana's flexibility."" PRESSURE'S ON Jana is hardly alone when it comes to activism, which has skyrocketed in the US since the credit crisis.With large piles of offshore cash, tech companies like Qualcomm and Apple - which bowed to pressure with its first-ever bond for a share buyback two years ago - are regular targets.According to Moody's, tech companies were the target of 20% of all such activism in 2014. And the ratings agency said there had been 55 cases across 14 non-financial industry sectors by early April, versus 43 in the same period in 2014.Qualcomm would be one of the last of the tech giants to bite the bullet and put debt on its balance sheet to pay for shareholder-friendly actions, and the market is gearing up for a bond deal as large as US$10bn.While there is no official mandate yet, expectations are that deal will surface soon after the company announces earnings on April 22.A bond would help finance a US$15bn share buyback plan announced by the company in March, about two-thirds of which it aims to do this year.Some analysts say Qualcomm could easily issue up to US$20bn and still keep a low single A rating.And the investment-grade bond market has proven time and again that it can absorb mammoth deals in one fell swoop - even for lower rated issuers like Actavis, which sold US$21bn across 10 tranches in March. Actavis is rated Baa3/BBB-/BBB-.""While we originally thought management would take leverage up to 1.0x, indicating a US$10bn issuance, we think that with activist pressure, Qualcomm may end up with closer to US$20bn of debt over time,"" said Erin Lyons, technology analyst at CreditSights.""At this level, Qualcomm could hold onto a low single A rating, given it would still have a sizeable net cash position.""(Reporting by Danielle Robinson; Editing by Natalie Harrison and Marc Carnegie)",2015-04-17,QCOM,"Fri Apr 17, 2015 | 11:40am EDT",Hedge fund pressure unlikely to block Qualcomm bond,http://www.reuters.com//article/qualcomm-bond-idUSL2N0XA1NI20150417?type=companyNews,0.8929,0.092,0.81,0.098

While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc's first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's new CEO, is charged with reviving the company's falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M's first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy.Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google's future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again.Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street's expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world's largest social network's business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets.

Investors will be looking out for the company's outlook for the remainder of 2015.On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices.On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines. Analysts and investors will be looking out for any details on the tax-free sale of its Alibaba shares.General Motors Co reports first-quarter results before the market opens on Thursday. Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before.On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts' average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer's flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that ""challenges"" with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business.Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes.Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units.

Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry's top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working.On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum's China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from ""brand fatigue"" in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules. The company says customers have simply switched to other meats and that it isn't losing sales - but investors will be on alert for any signs of a slowdown.Drugmaker Biogen Inc is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Friday, driven by strong sales of its top-selling oral MS drug, Tecfidera, which has seen burgeoning sales since its launch in 2013. Biogen, which leads the United States multiple sclerosis market with five drugs for the condition, recently reported promising data for its Alzheimer's drug. Investors will also be looking for commentary on Tecfider's growth expectations, and potential for competition, as well as the longer-acting MS injectable Plegridy.AbbVie Inc, whose planned $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics Inc is meant to lessen the company's dependence on its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug, is expected to report sharply higher earnings and sales for the first quarter on Thursday, fueled by Humira's continuing growth and sales of the company's recently approved Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C.

The company is well positioned to deliver a promised return to profit growth this year, helped by new treatments for cancer and diabetes and growing sales of its animal health brands.Abbott Laboratories will report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Recovering sales of Abbott Laboratories' infant formulas, following costly recalls in Asia, and improving performance of the company's branded generic medicines, are expected to drive quarterly earnings growth despite the negative impact of the stronger dollar.Ebay Inc is expected to report results for the first quarter largely in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. The company has seen strong growth in payments business as well as its non-auction e-commerce business. Analysts expect that the company will continue to benefit from the rise in demand for mobile devices, as consumers increasingly use their smart phones and tablets to shop online. Investors will look for details on the company's plans for the spinoff of PayPal scheduled for the second half of 2015.On Thursday, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit due to a stronger dollar and a slowdown in its agricultural business. The company last month said it would offload a bulk of its low-margin bleach and vinyl-related business to Olin in a $5 billion. Investors will be looking for further comments on the company's cost-saving plans. Johnson Controls Inc, the auto parts supplier and maker of climate control systems for buildings, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by higher sales in its seating and interiors business as auto sales and production rose in the first quarter. The company's buildings efficiency business, which provides air conditioning equipment and building management services, is also expected to report higher revenue as U.S. office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level since the third quarter to 2009. Investors will be looking for comments on Johnson Controls' business focus and outlook following the sale of its workplace solutions business to CBRE Group.Pentagon's No. 1 arms supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, reports first-quarter results on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin has been focusing on increasing sales to commercial customers in United States as well as international governments to make up for pressures from tight U.S. defense spending. Lockheed gets 17 percent of its revenue from international markets and 1 percent from U.S. commercial customers. Investors will be looking to see if Lockheed still expects U.S. military spending to meaningfully pick up this year.Weapons maker Raytheon Co has increased exposure to international markets, which account for about 27 percent of its total sales, as U.S. defense spending remains tight. The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system forecast disappointing 2015 revenue in January as domestic orders remained weak. When the company will report its first-quarter results on Thursday, investors will be looking for an update on a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that Raytheon expected to win in the first quarter.On Tuesday, Omnicom Group Inc, the No. 1 U.S. advertising company, is expected to report first-quarter results largely in-line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Omnicom had warned that a strong dollar would hit revenue this year. Omnicom, whose clients include Apple, McDonald's and Adidas, gets a little less than half of its revenue from outside the United States. On Friday, Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' average estimate according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company's previous quarter was helped by higher ad spending by businesses in the United States.On Tuesday, chipmaker Broadcom Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect the company's connectivity business to sequentially decline as it comes off a strong Apple-driven fourth quarter. Analysts will be looking for the company to provide outlook for the quarter ending June.On Wednesday, data storage company EMC Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit and revenue below analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had in January forecast a lower-than-expected profit for 2015 and said it would cut jobs. The company, which earns nearly half of its revenue from international markets, is expected to be hurt by a strong dollar. Analysts say enterprise storage demand has been mixed in quarter which may hurt EMC.Virtualization software maker VMware Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, hurt by a stronger dollar. More than 48 percent of VMware's revenue comes from outside the United States. Analysts at Wells Fargo estimate a negative impact of 3-4 percent from foreign currency on license revenue growth.Programmable chip maker Xilinx Inc will report fourth-quarter results after markets close on Wednesday. The company, which dominates the programmable chip market along with Altera Corp, is expected to report profit and revenue that are largely in line with analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will look for updates on sales to the broadcast, consumer and automotive end market and sales to communications and data center customers.PulteGroup Inc's first-quarter results are expected to be released on Thursday. Coming on the heels of larger peer D.R. Horton's second-quarter results on Wednesday, PulteGroup's results are expected to provide further evidence of a strong spring selling season this year, suggesting that a slowdown in housing starts in the first three months did not point to underlying weakness in the U.S. housing market.Steelmaker Nucor Corp will report first-quarter results on Thursday. Nucor has been struggling with lower selling prices due to high levels of imports. Declining oil prices have also led to excess inventory in Nucor's pipe and tube business. Analysts will be looking for comments on inventory, steel demand and overcapacity in its steel mills business. On Thursday, Patterson-UTI Energy Inc, the second-largest land driller in North America, is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit as weak oil prices weigh on drilling activity. Patterson, which halved its rig construction program for this year, had warned that 2015 would be ""challenging,"" having received indications that customers could terminate a number of longer-term contracts early. Investors will be looking for updates on further cost saving measures and commentary on contracts and dayrates for its 16 new high-tech Apex rigs, which analysts believe could help the driller boost cash margins this year.Contract driller Nabors Industries Ltd, which is merging with C&J Energy, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as drilling activity continues to be hurt by the fall in oil prices. The company has already warned of weak activity and pricing pressure in its international operations. Investors will be looking for updates on any job cuts and the company's plans to idle rigs in an oversupplied market.On Tuesday, coal miner Arch Coal Inc is expected to report a ninth straight quarterly loss and on Thursday, coal miner Peabody Energy Corp is expected to report a wider first-quarter loss due to continued weakness in coal prices.Kimberly-Clark Corp, the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers, is expected to report better-than-expected first-quarter sales, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, helped by growing demand in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and South Africa. However, higher input costs and a stronger dollar could have hurt profit. The company said in February it would transfer pension obligations to two insurers to reduce risk and will take a charge in the second quarter. It had also warned of an 8-9 percent drop in 2015 sales hurt by the dollar and weak demand for core products such as Huggies diapers. Investors will be looking for any updates on forecast on Tuesday.Hershey Co, the maker of Hershey's Kisses and Reese's peanut butter cups, has been struggling with high cocoa and dairy costs and intense competition from rivals such as Mondelez and Mars.

256,"   By Lehar Maan and Bill Rigby  Avago Technologies Ltd's (AVGO.O) $37 billion deal to buy chipmaker Broadcom  Corp (BRCM.O) creates new competitive challenges for Qualcomm and may force the world's largest mobile chip maker to radically rethink its own strategy.Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), which has dominated the market for connectivity chips on smartphones, has been looking to extend its reach into data centers and network infrastructure, but may find its way blocked by an enlarged competitor combining Avago's strength in storage and Broadcom's power in networking.""Qualcomm has aspirations of moving into Intel's data center processor incumbency that the Avago storage and now enterprise networking (from Broadcom) capability directly overlays,"" said Drexel Hamilton analyst Richard Whittington. That could result in Qualcomm creating some sort of partnership with Intel Corp (INTC.O), he said, to combat the reach of the new company.Wall Street analysts generally cheered the deal on Thursday, despite some fretting about price, saying Broadcom's strength  in wireless networking, WiFi and Bluetooth chips is a good complement to Avago's presence in industrial and wired devices.That presents a challenge to Qualcomm, which finds itself in a tough spot in the maturing microprocessor business, as smartphone makers such as Samsung (005930.KS), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Huawei (002502.SZ) put more effort into producing their own chips. Now a Avago/Broadcom tie-up - which will take the name of Broadcom - potentially gives handset makers another viable supplier, giving them more leverage and putting even more pressure on Qualcomm, said IDC analyst Mario Morales.""The other material impact will come from the adjacencies that Qualcomm is trying to enter now, the data center, infrastructure and the consumer area,"" he added. ""We see a lot of synergy in the technology they (Avago) are buying.""Qualcomm has hinted that it is looking at new areas.  ""I think there's going to be a tremendous amount of growth in computing and resources dedicated to supporting the cloud,"" Qualcomm chief executive Steve Mollenkopf said at last year's Consumer Electronics Show. ""We look at that as an opportunity for a company like ours.""The company did not immediately reply to a request for comment on its strategic plans in response to the Broadcom deal on Thursday.Avago/Broadcom is just the latest in a wave of heavyweight mergers and acquisitions reshaping the chip industry.  NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) unveiled a deal in March to buy smaller peer Freescale Semiconductor Ltd FSL.N. In the same month, Reuters reported that Intel was in talks to buy chipmaker Altera Corp ALTR.O, which many investors expect to result in a deal soon.That backdrop of consolidation may force Qualcomm's hand.""Either divest themselves of the business that they are in that is in direct competition with Broadcom - and now Avago - or find a way to grow their presence,"" said Chris Geier, partner-in-charge of Sikich Investment Banking, assessing Qualcomm's options. ""They are going to have to do one or the other. The status quo for them at this point won't work.""

264,"   By Mari Saito | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO Tumbling markets and economic uncertainty in China pose a risk to major chipmakers such as Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) that derive a big portion of their sales from the world's second-largest economy.Consumer electronics giant Apple Inc (AAPL.O) could also be vulnerable - 17 percent of the company's overall revenue last fiscal year came from China, and in the most recent quarter it sold more iPhones in the country than in the United States for the first time.But the slowing pace of China's economic growth - on top of already weakening demand for mobile devices - could deliver a particularly tough blow to chipmakers, analysts said. ""When you have waning demand hitting at the same time (as the stock market uncertainty), it just makes that industry that much more difficult,"" said Christopher Rolland, a senior equity analyst at FBR Capital Markets & Co. Beijing took steps during the weekend to revive shares following a 30 percent slide in its stock market since mid-June, which raised investors' concerns about the stability of the Chinese economy.Among the companies with the biggest exposure to China are Qualcomm and fellow chipmaker Broadcom Corp (BRCM.O), which depend on China for 50 percent and 24 percent of their overall revenue, respectively. Qualcomm declined to comment ahead of its earnings announcement, and a Broadcom representative was not immediately available to comment. Apple declined to comment.  China's stock market stumble comes as the chip sector was already facing a tough year. Research firm Gartner said it is downgrading its assessment of worldwide semiconductor sales, which it had initially expected to reach $354 billion this year, a 4 percent increase from 2014, although it has not yet released its new assessment.However, the situation may not be as dire as the revenue numbers indicate. Exposure to China may be smaller than the companies' reports suggest, according to Cody Acree, an analyst for Ascendiant Capital Markets.  For instance, Cirrus Logic Inc (CRUS.O), which supplies integrated circuits for audio and automotive applications, reports that it made nearly 80 percent of its revenue in China last year. But the company said the number represents where its products are manufactured and not necessarily the end-market where products are sold. The company said it did not currently see any impact on its business.

266,"   By Foo Yun Chee and Eric Auchard | BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT  BRUSSELS/FRANKFURT European Union antitrust regulators are investigating whether one of the world's biggest chipmakers, Qualcomm, uses illegal tactics to shut out rivals, six years after slapping a record 1 billion euro ($1.09 billion) fine on Intel for a similar offense.Qualcomm has been feeling the heat from regulators in Europe, the United States, China, Japan and South Korea in recent years in relation to its licensing model and the power of its patents in mobile networks and communications devices.The U.S. company agreed in February to pay a fine of $975 million to end a 14-month investigation by the Chinese government into anti-competitive practices. The European Commission said on Thursday it was launching twin probes into the San Diego-based chip designer which center on its control of baseband components used in most of the world's smartphones, including Apple iPhones.One investigation will look into whether Qualcomm offered financial incentives to customers for baseband chips that form the core of the latest 4G phones and tablets, on condition that they bought exclusively or almost exclusively from Qualcomm.The second will look at whether Qualcomm engaged in ""predatory pricing"" by charging at less than cost with a view to forcing competitors out of the market.  The second probe was triggered by a complaint from British phone software maker Icera, which later was acquired by Nvidia Corp in a bid to enter the market for smartphone chips and compete with Qualcomm. ""We are launching these investigations because we want to be sure that high-tech suppliers can compete on the merits of their products,"" European Competition Commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement.""Many customers use electronic devices, such as a mobile phone or a tablet, and we want to ensure that they ultimately get value for money.""Qualcomm, which faces a fine of up to 10 percent of its global  turnover if found guilty of breaching EU rules, said it was disappointed to hear of the new EU investigations. ""We have been cooperating and will continue to cooperate with the Commission, and we continue to believe that any concerns are without merit,"" it said in a statement.The Commission is expected to seek information from Intel, Broadcom, Marvell, MediaTek, Renesas and the former ST-Ericsson joint venture as part of its investigations.As recently as 2009, the market for mobile baseband chips was teaming with competitors, but many established names have since quit. The components are key to allowing the latest 4G phones to ship data at high speeds without sapping batteries.  Texas Instruments, Broadcom, Freescale and ST-Ericsson have all exited this specific category in recent years to focus on other sectors. Graphics chip maker Nvidia, which paid $367 million in 2011 to acquire Icera, acknowledged in May that it had failed to make inroads into the market and that it would wind down its Icera business, if it could not find a buyer. More than 500 jobs, mostly in Britain and France, could be lost.Nvidia declined to comment on the EU investigations.In 2009 the EU closed, without taking further action, a two-year antitrust probe into whether Qualcomm charged unreasonably high royalties for technology that was an integral part of global 3G phone standards.

281,"  LONDON Top European technology stocks shed nearly $6 billion of market value on Wednesday, with suppliers for Apple the top fallers after the tech giant's revenue forecasts fell short of expectations.While the worst hit were the handful with 20-70 percent direct exposure, the whole sector suffered as investors cautioned against frothy valuations, with the STOXX Europe 600 tech index .SX8P trading well above its historical average.The European technology index lost 5.7 billion dollars of market capitalization, led lower by a 6.5 percent slump in Germany's Dialog Semiconductors and a 5.1 percent fall in British-listed ARM Holdings ARM.L. Apple orders accounted for around 70-75 percent of Dialog's total revenue, industry experts said, while Apple accounted for 20-25 percent of ARM's processor royalties last year.While Apple's biggest suppliers, such as Intel (INTC.O) and Qualcomm (QCOM.O), are American, Apple is a large customer of many smaller European companies.Dialog, which makes chips for Apple, lost $287 million, while ARM, which licenses chip designs for use in Apple products, saw $1.7 billion knocked off its value.Dialog remains up 67 percent so far this year, and trades at valuations over 15 percent higher than its historical averages. ""We have nothing against Apple, but expectations on that side of the market are a little bit too high and that the reason we now don't have any Apple-related stocks,"" said Anko Beldsnijder, managing director of MainFirst Asset Management.Austria's Ams AG fell 2.9 percent. Its technology is used in the Apple watch, though in June a Swiss newspaper reported it would miss out on a valuable new Apple contract. Shares in European companies with smaller direct exposure to Apple such as Infineon (IFXGn.DE) and STMicro (STM.PA) also fell by around 5 percent, with investors saying sentiment around technology stocks in general had turned negative. The STOXX Europe tech index trades at a price of 18.7 times its 12-month forward earnings, against a 10-year average of 16.2 times, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream.

293,"   By Liana B. Baker | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Qualcomm Inc's (QCOM.O) President Derek Aberle, under pressure from activist hedge fund Jana Partners to improve the licensing and chip design firm's stock performance, on Thursday sounded a cautionary note about a potential breakup of the company.Stressing that the board and management do not expect to  complete a review of a possible split until the end of the year,  Aberle told Reuters that Qualcomm agrees with Jana that its stock is undervalued. Shares have fallen 25 percent over the past 12 months, whereas the S&P 500 is down 2.25 percent. Aberle said that investors calling for a split are taking a ""sum of the parts"" analysis and believe that Qualcomm's two divisions  - its highly profitable licensing arm and its chips unit - would be valued more highly as independent companies. ""You have to step back and say why is that and would a separation actually solve whatever the underlying issues are that are creating the current valuation?,"" he said. ""You have to be careful that it's not too simplistic an analysis.""The company's current structure, Aberle said, also allows Qualcomm to leverage relationships with Chinese customers, since the chipmaker is well-positioned to help them expand to other countries.  At the same time, Aberle acknowledged that having both a chips and licensing division has at times created conflicts with customers, ""but we manage it pretty well.""  DEALING WITH JANA  Jana in April unleashed a public campaign to reform Qualcomm, calling its chip business ""essentially worthless"" at current valuations and pressing the company to spin it off or pursue strategic mergers or acquisitions.Aberle said that when Qualcomm was approached by Jana, the hedge fund which owned $2 billion in stock did not pressure it to pursue a breakup but rather wanted them to review a split as one option to unlock value. It is also working on adding a third independent board member, whom Aberle declined to name. Qualcomm has already added two new board members in cooperation with Jana. ""A lot of the things (Jana) put on the table were very consistent with things we’d already been talking to our shareholders about and already been planning for a long time,"" Aberle said. Qualcomm said in July it would reduce costs by about $1.4 billion, cut about 4,500 full-time staff, or 15 percent of its workforce, and boost capital returns to shareholders.  (Reporting by Liana B.

The company, which got half of its fiscal 2014 revenue from Chinese customers, said it expected the issue to be resolved once the new agreements were completed. Qualcomm is in the middle of a strategic review after hedge fund Jana Partners urged it to separate its chip unit from its highly profitable patent-licensing business.

Samsung had not ruled out using Qualcomm's chips in the future and media reported last month that the South Korean company's Galaxy S7 phones for the U.S. and China markets were expected to use Snapdragon 820 chips.

298,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar  Qualcomm Inc forecast first-quarter profit way below analysts' expectations as the chipmaker struggles against fierce competition from Chinese and Taiwanese rivals, and faces delays in closing new licensing agreements in China.The company's shares fell nearly 6 percent in extended trading on Wednesday.Qualcomm's agreements with two major Chinese customers are taking longer than anticipated, Chief Executive Steve Mollenkopf said on a conference call. President Derek Aberle said some Chinese customers were ""improperly withholding"" royalties on Qualcomm's patents by changing the way they report sales. The company, which got half of its fiscal 2014 revenue from Chinese customers, said it expected the issue to be resolved once the new agreements were completed. Qualcomm is in the middle of a strategic review after hedge fund Jana Partners urged it to separate its chip unit from its highly profitable patent-licensing business.  The company has also announced job cuts and other cost-cutting steps in the face of stiff competition, which is likely to intensify as chipmakers consolidate to meet demand for cheaper semiconductors and to diversify their portfolios. Qualcomm said on Wednesday that demand for the new version of its flagship Snapdragon mobile chips was stronger than it had expected in the fourth quarter. The company was hurt earlier this year by Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's decision to use an internally developed processor, instead of the Snapdragon chips, in its Galaxy S6 smartphones.  Samsung had not ruled out using Qualcomm's chips in the future and media reported last month that the South Korean company's Galaxy S7 phones for the U.S. and China markets were expected to use Snapdragon 820 chips. Samsung is seen rolling out the Galaxy S7 early next year. Qualcomm forecast a profit of 80-90 cents per share for the current quarter, well below the average analyst estimate of $1.08, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The net income attributable to the company fell 44 percent to $1.06 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 27.

314,"   By Suzanne Barlyn  Qualcomm Inc has agreed to pay $7.5 million to settle charges it violated U.S. anti-bribery laws by hiring relatives of Chinese officials to obtain business, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday.The Chinese officials related to Qualcomm's new hires were deciding whether to select the company’s mobile technology products amid growing competition in the global telecommunications market, the SEC said.The conduct, which included offering jobs to some individuals who fell short of hiring standards at the San Diego-based telecommunications company, occurred between 2002 and 2012, the SEC said.Qualcomm, which neither admitted nor denied the SEC's findings, had previously disclosed the SEC probe, the company said in a statement. Qualcomm has taken additional steps to enhance its existing internal controls and procedures, it said.The case is part of an SEC crackdown involving the hiring of ""princelings,"" the term used in Asia to refer to the children or younger relatives of China's political leaders or top executives at state-owned enterprises. The practice could potentially violate U.S. anti-bribery laws.  HSBC, Europe's biggest lender, disclosed on Feb. 22 that the SEC was also investigating its hiring practices in Asia. The SEC had also opened a probe into JPMorgan in 2013 regarding the hiring of princelings.Improper hiring by Qualcomm included a situation in 2010, when a manager at a Chinese state-owned telecommunications company asked Qualcomm employees to find an internship at Qualcomm for her daughter. A Qualcomm employee noted the girl's parents gave ""great help"" for Qualcomm's business development, the SEC said in a settlement.In another instance, Qualcomm gave financial support to the son of an executive at another state-owned company through a $75,000 research grant to an American university where he studied. The measure allowed the son to renew his student visa and retain his position in a PhD program. The Chinese executive's son was later a Qualcomm intern and then permanently employed, despite being deemed a ""no hire"" after company interviews.A Qualcomm executive later personally loaned the employee $70,000 to buy a home. Qualcomm now closely monitors employment referrals to determine if candidates have relationships with employees of state-owned entities or government, the company said. It applies a stricter scrutiny to avoid potential future anti-bribery law risks, the company said.The SEC also found that Qualcomm provided gifts, travel, and entertainment to try to influence officials at government-owned telecom companies in China.Qualcomm lacked sufficient internal controls to detect those payments and misrepresented them in the company's books and records as legitimate business expenses, the SEC said.

Analysts on average were expecting a profit of $1.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Research firm Gartner expects global smartphone sales to grow in single digits in percentage terms for the first time ever this year, while Apple in January also forecast its first revenue drop in 13 years.The uncertainty in the smartphone business seemed to show in the company's third-quarter revenue forecast of $5.2-$6.0 billion, which implies revenue could be between 11 percent lower and 3 percent higher than the year-ago quarter.However, while Qualcomm's chip business is the bigger contributor to revenue, the San Diego-based company's business of licensing its chip technology is the bigger driver of profit. But here too the company has faced delays in closing licensing agreements in China, its biggest market.Qualcomm, which has recently signed new deals with several companies including Lenovo, said on Wednesday it was still in talks with key Chinese smartphone makers to sign agreements. Revenue at Qualcomm's chipmaking division and its licensing business fell, 25 percent and 12 percent respectively, in the latest quarter, dragging down total revenue for the fourth quarter in a row.However, the 19.5 percent drop, to $5.55 billion, in the three months ended March 27, was less than the nearly 23 percent drop analysts were expecting.Net income attributable to Qualcomm rose 10.5 percent to  $1.16 billion, or 78 cents per share.

333,"  June 24 Qualcomm Inc has filed a complaint in a Chinese court against smartphone maker Meizu Technology Co after the tech giant said it was unable to reach a licensing accord with one of the top 10 handset suppliers in its biggest market.The filing by San Diego-based Qualcomm, submitted to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court on Friday, is the first legal action by Qualcomm as it seeks to uphold terms of its landmark 2015 anti-trust settlement with China's economic policy panel, the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC). Qualcomm agreed to pay a fine of $975 million in the settlement, the largest in China's corporate history.The complaint against Meizu asks the court to affirm that Qualcomm's terms for a patent license agreement complies with China's anti-monopoly law and the company's fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory licensing obligations under its 2015 remediation agreement with the NDRC, the company said.Reuters could not immediately contact officials at Meizu for comment.Don Rosenberg, Qualcomm's general counsel, said in a telephone interview that the firm has negotiated extensively and in good faith with Meizu to sign a patent license agreement consistent with the terms of the rectification plan submitted by Qualcomm to, and accepted by the NDRC. ""There's no question that Qualcomm's intellectual property has been used and we have not been properly paid,"" Rosenberg said. He said Qualcomm was not focused on damages, but on leveling the playing field for everyone in China.Meizu, located in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai, was China's eighth-biggest smartphone maker in 2015, shipping 24.82 million devices for the year, according to IDC data. China is Qualcomm's most important market, making up 53 percent of global revenue of $25.28 billion for the fiscal year ended Sept. 27, with a large chunk of profit coming from higher-margin royalties earned from the company's licensing arm.As part of its 2015 settlement with the NRDC, Qualcomm agreed to a plan that modified its business practices in China.

335,"  SHANGHAI Qualcomm Inc has filed 17 fresh complaints in China against Meizu Technology Co, stepping up its battle with the Chinese smartphone maker after the two were unable to reach a licensing accord in the U.S. tech giant's biggest market.The patent infringement complaints by Qualcomm, submitted to intellectual property courts in Beijing and Shanghai on Thursday, mark the second time in a week it has taken legal action against Meizu, one of China's top 10 handset suppliers. It filed its first complaint in Beijing last Friday.Qualcomm is seeking to uphold terms of its landmark 2015 anti-trust settlement with China's economic policy panel, the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC). The San Diego-based firm agreed to pay a fine of $975 million in the settlement, the largest in China's corporate history.The 17 latest patent infringement complaints cover a range of features and technologies used in smartphones, Qualcomm said, including those relating to 3G (WCDMA and CDMA2000) and 4G (LTE) wireless communications standards. ""Meizu is attempting to obtain an unfair and improper cost advantage over its competitors,"" said Qualcomm's general counsel, Don Rosenberg, in an e-mailed statement to Reuters.

Talks are in the early stages and NXP may entertain other offers, should they emerge, according to one of the sources.  An agreement with Qualcomm could be struck in the next two to three months, according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported news of the talks. Representatives for Netherlands-based NXP and San Diego-based Qualcomm declined to comment. NXP shares rose 16.9 percent to close at $96.12 on Thursday, while Qualcomm's rose 6.3 percent to $67.45.  NXP closed a nearly $12 billion deal to buy U.S.-based Freescale Semiconductor last December, creating the world's top maker of automotive electronics and doubling the percentage of its auto-related revenue to 40 percent. It could also attract interest from other large semiconductor companies such as Broadcom and Texas Instruments Inc (TXN.O), analysts have said. Qualcomm, which supplies Android smartphone makers and Apple Inc (AAPL.O), has been dealing with slowing smartphone sales and stiff competition from Chinese and Taiwanese rivals.Qualcomm has so far sat out the transformative consolidation sweeping the industry, which has seen mega-deals such as Avago (AVGO.O)  buying Broadcom for $37 billion last year.  Qualcomm gets the bulk of its revenue from chip sales but most of its profit comes from wireless patents it licenses to the mobile industry. It explored a plan to break up its chip business from its patent licensing unit after pressure from activist investor Jana Partners but decided to remain whole. Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh said that the deal would give Qualcomm a roadmap for the next decade while moving away from a maturing handset market and toward the faster growing opportunity in automotives. Qualcomm was ranked third in terms of revenue among global semiconductor companies in 2015, while NXP ranked No. 7, according to research firm IHS.

Qualcomm, which faces a second antitrust charge of making illegal payments to a major customer for exclusively using its chipsets since 2011, did not ask an oral hearing for this case, the people said.Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso and Qualcomm, which supplies Android smartphone makers and Apple Inc, declined to comment. The company could face a fine up to $2.5 billion or 10 percent of its 2015 revenue, if found guilty of breaking EU rules. (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee.

Foreign purchases of British firms have also slumped 69 percent, according to the figures, despite a sharply weaker pound.That stands in contrast to a burst of dealmaking in the United States and the rest of Europe, which has lifted bankers' hopes for a Christmas fee bonanza after an otherwise mediocre year for M&A globally. AT&T's (T.N)'s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner (TWX.N), Qualcomm's (QCOM.O) $38.5 billion buy of Dutch chip  maker NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) and GE Oil & Gas's $32 billion merger with Baker Hughes (BHI.N) are expected to earn bankers advising on these deals $475.91 million in fees, data compiled by Thomson Reuters and Freeman & Co show.  Those deals, announced in the past month, have pushed global fees earned from completed mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to stand at $21 billion so far this year, down 7 percent on the same period in 2015.Last year was a record year for dealmaking globally with several large deals involving UK-listed companies, like Anheuser-Busch Inbev's (ABI.BR) $110.3 billion acquisition of SABMiller and Shell's (RDSa.L) $53 billion takeover of BG Group.      Softbank's (9984.T) $30.7 billion acquisition of UK-based chip designer ARM Holdings in July had sparked hopes among bankers that the fall in sterling might lead to more deals, but few others have materialized so far.    LAZARD JUMPS ON SABMILLER, BG DEALS  Goldman Sachs remains the biggest earner globally according to Thomson Reuters.But the stand-out performer has been pure advisory firm Lazard (LAZ.N), which is the top fee-earner in Europe so far this year. If it retains that position by the end of 2016 it will be the first time in the 15 years that the data has been collated that it has clinched the top spot. Lazard advised Tyco International on its $16.5 billion merger with Johnson Controls and also worked with ARM Holdings on the Softbank deal.Globally, Lazard ranked fourth both in terms of fees from completed deals and the number of announced deals so far this year, challenging large American bulge bracket banks which also get M&A credit for lending money to their clients.  Companies over the past few years have increasingly turned to so-called ""boutique"" pure advisory firms which are seen as more independent in their advice than universal lending banks. Another pure-play advisory firm, Rothschild (ROTH.PA), ranked number two for European fees and number six globally, the data showed.Among the bulge bracket firms, UBS is set for a record year after advising Swiss chemical firm Syngenta on its $43 billion deal with Chemchina. The Swiss bank ranks at number two for announced deals so far this year in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), just behind Goldman Sachs. But its European rival Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), which is in the middle of a strategic overhaul as it risks a multi-billion fine from U.S. regulator, has been struggling, falling from sixth to tenth globally on announced deals so far this year, the data showed.

393,"  Rockwell Automation Inc (ROK.N), whose automated systems help factories run smoothly, reported a steeper-than-expected fall in quarterly profit, hurt by lower sales outside the United States and in its largest business.The company's shares fell about 5 percent to $114.32 in premarket trading on Wednesday after Rockwell also cut the top end of its full-year earnings forecast.Rockwell narrowed its 2014 adjusted earnings forecast to $6.10-$6.25 per share from $6.00-$6.35.

413,"   By Ankit Ajmera and Meredith Davis  Rockwell Automation Inc forecast its first full-year rise in sales in three years as stabilizing demand in industries including oil and gas helped the company report higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue.Shares of the company, which makes factory automation systems, rose as much as 6 percent to $124.75 on Monday.Rockwell has been hit by weak oil prices that curtailed customer spending in the oil and gas industry, which accounted for about 12 percent of revenue in the year ended Sept. 30, 2015.Rockwell has been cutting jobs as part of a restructuring plan and estimates gross savings of more than $30 million in fiscal 2017. The company also forecast adjusted earnings of $5.85-$6.25 per share and a 1-5 percent rise in sales for the year. Analysts on average were expecting adjusted earnings of $5.98 per share on revenue of $5.88 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Rockwell's fiscal 2017 sales forecast seemed ""aggressive"" and has a ""risk of negative revisions as the year progresses in a still uncertain environment,"" J.P.Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note. Last week, rival Emerson Electric Co forecast a 1-3 percent drop in underlying sales for the year ending Sept. 30, 2017, citing lower industrial spending.Rockwell said it could consider acquisitions in fiscal 2017 as it looks to drive sales growth. ""We have a strong pipeline of potential acquisitions in various stages that address one or more of three focus areas around the world,"" Chief Executive Blake Moret told Reuters.  Sales in Rockwell's architecture and software business, which makes computers that help run manufacturing processes, rose 1.8 percent to $696.4 million in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30.

414,"   By Ankit Ajmera and Meredith Davis  Rockwell Automation Inc forecast its first full-year rise in sales in three years as stabilizing demand in industries including oil and gas helped the company report higher-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue.Shares of the company, which makes factory automation systems, rose as much as 6 percent to $124.75 on Monday.Rockwell has been hit by weak oil prices that curtailed customer spending in the oil and gas industry, which accounted for about 12 percent of revenue in the year ended Sept. 30, 2015.Rockwell has been cutting jobs as part of a restructuring plan and estimates gross savings of more than $30 million in fiscal 2017. The company also forecast adjusted earnings of $5.85-$6.25 per share and a 1-5 percent rise in sales for the year. Analysts on average were expecting adjusted earnings of $5.98 per share on revenue of $5.88 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Rockwell's fiscal 2017 sales forecast seemed ""aggressive"" and has a ""risk of negative revisions as the year progresses in a still uncertain environment,"" J.P.Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note. Last week, rival Emerson Electric Co forecast a 1-3 percent drop in underlying sales for the year ending Sept. 30, 2017, citing lower industrial spending.Rockwell said it could consider acquisitions in fiscal 2017 as it looks to drive sales growth. ""We have a strong pipeline of potential acquisitions in various stages that address one or more of three focus areas around the world,"" Chief Executive Blake Moret told Reuters.  Sales in Rockwell's architecture and software business, which makes computers that help run manufacturing processes, rose 1.8 percent to $696.4 million in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30.

420,"  * Q4 post-tax ENI per adjusted share $1.64 vs Street view 91 cents* Q4 distributable earnings $401 mln vs $188 mln a year ago* Most profitable quarter since Carlyle went public in 2012By Greg RoumeliotisFeb 19 Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP  said on Wednesday its fourth-quarter earnings rose by 216 percent to a record, as the value of its funds jumped and profits generated from the sales of assets soared, beating most analysts' forecasts.Buoyant capital markets not only boosted the value of the companies held by Carlyle's funds but also allowed the Washington, D.C.-based firm to cash out on more of its investments and return money to its investors.""Our performance exceeded our prior outlook because some of the exit activities that we earlier expected would occur in future periods in fact occurred in 2013,"" Carlyle co-founder and co-chief executive David Rubenstein told analysts on a conference call.The value of Carlyle's private equity funds rose by 9 percent in the fourth quarter. Peer Blackstone Group LP  reported an 11.5 percent rise in the same quarter, Apollo Global Management LLC reported a 9 percent rise and KKR & Co LP  reported an 8.4 percent rise.Assets sales in the quarter included Carlyle's $1.39 billion sale of aerospace communications company Arinc Inc to Rockwell Collins Inc and the sale of human resources software company Personal & Informatik AG to private equity firm HgCapital, generating returns of 4.5 times and 6.5 times of Carlyle's investors' money respectively. Carlyle also completed the initial public offerings of luxury jacket maker Moncler SpA, telecommunications equipment maker CommScope Holding Company Inc, travel agency CVC Brasil Operadora & Agencia de Viagens SA  and cable operator Numericable Group SA.It also sold shares in auto parts maker Allison Transmission Holdings Inc, television ratings company Nielsen Holdings NV, BankUnited Inc and consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton Corp, which were already publicly listed.Economic net income (ENI), an earnings measure comprising cash and paper profits or losses based on how funds have been marked to market, increased to $576 million in the fourth quarter from $182 million a year earlier.This translated into post-tax adjusted ENI per share of $1.64. Analysts on average expected 91 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. This was the best quarterly financial result for Carlyle since its initial public offering in 2012.Carlyle shares were up 3.4 percent at $36.68 in early afternoon trading in New York. They had fallen 0.1 percent in the 12 months leading up to Wednesday, compared to a 21 percent rise in the S&P 500 Index. Carlyle also said the value of seven of its funds rose enough in the fourth quarter for them to exceed return hurdle rates of between 7 and 8 percent. This entitles them to pay out so-called carried interest, giving Carlyle a slice of the investment profits generated by the funds at a time of Carlyle's choosing.EARNINGS BLOT A blot on Carlyle's earnings was its real estate and energy division, which reported a loss as a European real estate fund underperformed and the valuation of some energy funds that Carlyle launched with another private equity firm, Riverstone Holdings LLC, dropped. Carlyle has ended its partnership with Riverstone and in 2012 took over another energy-focused private equity firm, Natural Gas Partners, for which it has high hopes.Carlyle also runs credit funds, hedge funds and fund-of-funds products whose divisions also saw profits rise. But private equity continues to dominate the firm's earnings, accounting for 80 percent of its profits in 2013.Carlyle's pre-tax distributable earnings, which show how much cash is available to pay dividends, were $401 million in the fourth quarter versus $188 million a year earlier, as the firm monetized more of its assets.Assets under management were $188.8 billion at the end of December, up from $185 billion at the end of September. Carlyle announced in November it had raised a $13 billion U.S. private equity fund, surpassing its $10 billion target.Rubenstein also said that Carlyle had raised $2 billion from retail investors in 2013 and expressed confidence that the two mutual funds it plans to launch this year will be differentiated enough to succeed in a competitive marketplace.He declined to comment on competitor KKR's disclosure last week that it would liquidate two funds targeting individual investors, in a blow to the firm's efforts to widen its appeal beyond institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance firms.Carlyle's fee-related earnings were $39 million in the fourth quarter, down 30 percent from a year earlier.Carlyle declared a fourth-quarter dividend of $1.40 per share. Dividends for 2013 totaled $1.88 per share, representing 75 percent of Carlyle's after-tax distributable earnings. The firm reaffirmed its dividend policy of paying out 75 to 85 percent of its after-tax distributable earnings in 2014.",2014-02-19,COL,"Wed Feb 19, 2014 | 12:36pm EST",UPDATE 2-Carlyle's fourth-quarter earnings more than triple,http://www.reuters.com//article/carlyle-results-idUSL2N0LO0VG20140219?type=companyNews,0.9968,0.022,0.871,0.107

427,"  (Adds details on possible bidders, share price and comment from minority shareholder)By Peter Maushagen, Tim Hepher and Sagarika JaisinghaniFRANKFURT/PARIS May 5 German aircraft seating maker Recaro is looking at buying assets from B/E Aerospace  after the U.S. company announced a surprise review that could lead to a shakeup of the $3 billion cabins industry.Florida-based B/E Aerospace on Sunday postponed Monday's investor meeting and said it has hired Citigroup Inc  advisers to explore options, including a possible sale, merger or spinoff of the company or selected businesses.The statement came less than two weeks after the company reported a record quarter for new orders amid rising demand for wide-bodied jets, and said it was looking at two potential aerospace acquisitions and had completed a third.Analysts said the review could lead to a break-up of the 26-year-old company, which has grown through more than two dozen acquisitions to become one of the largest makers of aircraft seats, with a leading role in the parts distribution chain.Asked in Frankfurt whether Recaro Aircraft Seating was interested in buying any assets from B/E Aerospace, Chief Executive Mark Hiller told reporters: ""We are looking into it"".B/E shares jumped around 10 percent in early U.S. trading on Monday to $97.99.In Paris, B/E's closest rival in the seats market, Zodiac Aerospace, declined to comment. Its shares were down 1.2 percent, slightly lagging a weaker overall market.""Zodiac cannot be considered a potential bidder on the deal in our view,"" said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christophe Menard.Given B/E Aerospace's $9 billion market value, ""an acquisition in full of the company could only be carried out by a much larger player in aerospace,"" he said in a note.But several of the large companies that could bid for all or part of B/E Aerospace appeared already occupied with other acquisition strategies.General Electric Co said last week that its $13.5 billion offer for the power business of France's Alstom  would effectively fill its allotment for acquisitions through next year, while the company's aviation division is focused predominantly on manufacturing jet engines. At United Technologies Corp analysts have said recently that the diversified manufacturer is more likely to focus on deals to boost its commercial building businesses, which sell elevators and climate control systems, than on aerospace.On United Technologies' earnings call last month, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes said the idea of striking a big deal this year was very unlikely.Honeywell International Inc said in March that it was planning for $10 billion in deals through 2018 as part of its five-year financial plan. That deal value would more than double what Honeywell spent in the previous five years on acquisitions, but the spending was expected to be spread across the whole company, not just the aerospace division, which works primarily on electrical and mechanical systems.Avionics maker Rockwell Collins took on significant debt recently to buy Arinc, whose computer networks help flight crew navigation. That may limit its ability to do a big deal.Spokesmen for GE, United Technologies, Honeywell and Rockwell declined to comment.A bid from within the industry for the seats business would have to overcome competition hurdles, with Zodiac and B/E controlling around 70 percent of the market between them. Buying assets from B/E Aerospace could help Recaro, a family run firm, to expand in the lucrative market for premium seating. Recaro says it is the market leader for economy seats, but wants to expand its grip on profitable premium seats.On Monday, the unlisted German company reported sales of 337 million euros for 2013 and said it was aiming to reach 600 million in 2018, not including the effects of any acquisitions.BREAK-UP TALK B/E Aerospace makes lavatories for the Boeing 737 and galleys for the Airbus A350, as well as seats and oxygen units. It also has a spare parts distribution business.The company made just over half its 2013 revenue of $3.48 billion from commercial aircraft, with about a third coming from consumables management, as the spare parts business is known. Consumables management is the slowest-growing part of the company. The rest of B/E Aerospace's revenue comes from luxury fittings for business jets. In 2008, B/E Aerospace bought the consumables distribution business of Honeywell for $1 billion to create what it describes as the world's largest distributor of fasteners or specialist bolts, operating in a market estimated at $4.5 billion a year.Most analysts said a sale was most likely to work if B/E Aerospace split the interiors business from distribution. And several researchers, including Oppenheimer, said the abrupt weekend announcement suggested talks were already under way.B/E Aerospace shares have risen 40 percent in the past year. In midday trading in New York the stock was up 10.8 percent at $98.60.Several brokers raised their price targets to as much as $121, while noting aerospace acquisitions are looking expensive as commercial suppliers ride a wave of orders and increases in production.B/E Aerospace shares trade at 19.1 times this year's forecast earnings, compared with an average multiple of 16.3 for its industry peers, according to Thomson Reuters data.The company, which has net debt of $1.6 billion, has an enterprise value of 11.6 times its forecast earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, giving it a premium over the sector average of 10.2, according to the data.Scott Thompson, who heads PricewaterhouseCoopers' aerospace and defence coverage, said the announcement from B/E underscored growing interest in acquisition and mergers.""We see things heating up,"" said Thompson, who put out a study last week predicting increased M&A activity this year.B/E management likely has a clear idea of what they can get for the company, and is in a strong position having posted robust earnings in a market ripe with potential investors, said George Young, a partner at St. Denis J. Villere & Co LLC, which owns about 2 percent of the company.He's hoping for a deal priced at the top end of broker targets.""If it's less than $120 per share, then I would be somewhat disappointed,"" Young said.

[ID:nWNAB05IFV]As part of that program, the Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based aerospace manufacturer will develop heads-up displays for the 777X similar to those now supplied on Boeing 787 Dreamliners. The displays allow pilots to see instrument readings while looking out the cockpit window. The 777X is a refresh of Boeing's wide-body 777 jetliner, which is due to enter service in 2020. In tandem, Rockwell Collins will develop and certify heads-up displays for the 777, Boeing's current production mini-jumbo jetliner.  Rockwell wouldn't disclose the value of the 777X contract, but Statler said it will provide a ""very material"" benefit to the company's earnings as it begins product deliveries around 2019.

434,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Sharply falling oil prices are providing a windfall for global airlines by cutting their massive fuel bills, but a weaker euro will temper the benefits for European carriers and limit their ability to spend on aircraft upgrades, the head of Rockwell Collins (COL.N) said on Friday.While the currency effects will not completely neutralize the fuel gains, ""there's no question that ... European currency countries aren't going to see as much good news,"" Chief Executive Kelly Ortberg said in an interview.""In some of those airlines, budgets are going to be tight because of the strengthening dollar against the euro,"" he added. The Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based maker of avionics and information systems has not yet seen an impact from currencies or from lower fuel prices. The company also is actively exploring potential acquisitions for both its defense and information management businesses, Ortberg said.Ortberg expects fuel savings to lift its sales to business jet companies as early as this summer, since they are less hedged on fuel than commercial airlines. Commercial airline sales likely would emerge in the company's next fiscal year. Earlier Friday, Rockwell Collins reported a 26 percent rise in net profit on a 16 percent rise in sales for its fiscal first quarter. On Thursday, the European Central bank announced a 1 trillion euro bond-buying program, sending the euro to 11 year lows against the dollar.  ""Most of the major airlines have hedges, some up to three years, so while fuel is coming down, they're not seeing the direct budget windfall,"" Ortberg said. ""It's going to be a little while before we see any change in buying behavior.""""Having said that, there's no question that this is good news for them. And if there are things they wanted to do but couldn't afford it, they're going to be revisiting that. We're going to see some good news, it's just a little early.""Rockwell Collins wants to build its defense portfolio with acquisitions that can also add capability to its commercial products, especially now that uncertainty about the U.S. defense budget has eased and company valuations are more clear.

444,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force on Monday named Pratt & Whitney as the engine maker for the new Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) long-range strike bomber, and defended the plane's ""cost plus incentive fee"" contract that has been challenged by U.S. lawmakers.U.S. Air Force Secretary Deborah James revealed the names of the engine maker, a unit of United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and other key suppliers at a Pentagon news conference amid growing calls for more transparency about the classified arms program.Other key suppliers for the new B-21 bomber include the U.S. units of two British suppliers, BAE Systems Plc (BAES.L) and GKN Plc (GKN.L), as well as Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc (SPR.N), Orbital ATK Inc (OA.N), Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N) and Janicki Industries, a family-owned company, James said.Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) last month dropped their challenge to the multibillion-dollar bomber contract that Northrop won in October.James said the suppliers named Monday would work on the airframe and mission systems of the new flying wing stealth bomber, but gave no details. Lieutenant General Arnold Bunch, the Air Force's top military acquisition official, declined to say where Northrop would assemble the planes.He said the Air Force hoped in time to provide the value of the bomber development contract and associated incentive fees.He said the incentive fees were based on cost and performance, with an emphasis on meeting plans to start using the new planes in combat from the mid 2020s. The Air Force initially estimated it would cost $23.5 billion to develop the new bomber, but has not released terms of its contract with Northrop. Analysts have said the overall deal could be worth $80 billion to Northrop and its suppliers over time.James said the Air Force was working to address questions raised by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain about the Northrop contract. McCain fears it could leave the U.S. government liable for potential cost increases. She said it would take ""money and time"" to cancel and redo the deal if McCain succeeds in blocking it.McCain says the Air Force has been spared from $1 billion in cost overruns on a new refueling plane being built by Boeing since that plane was developed under a fixed price contract.But Bunch said this program was different since it involved a wholly new airplane, and the company had no potential commercial or foreign military sales customers to help defray its costs.

448,"   By Alwyn Scott | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Boeing Co (BA.N) reported a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss on Wednesday, cushioned by strong performances in its jetliner and defense businesses.The world's biggest plane maker warned last week it planned to take $3 billion in pretax charges related to its 787, 747 and KC-46 tanker aircraft programs.But the quarterly loss of 44 cents a share in so-called core results, which excludes some pension and other expenses, was less than half the 93-cent loss that analysts expected, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Analysts said Boeing produced more aircraft at higher operating profit margins. The company also notched down its full-year forecast by just $2.05 a share, significantly less than the after-tax charges of $3.23 a share. That suggested Boeing is confident that margins will stay firm in the second half, said Ken Herbert, analyst at Canaccord Genuity.      Still, investors remained concerned about a cyclical downturn, a weak global economy and softening demand, factors other industrial companies cited in recent days.""Boeing still faces a tough environment with increasing competition,"" said Jeff Windau, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. Boeing shares rose 3 percent in early trading, but by mid-afternoon they eased and were up 1.2 percent at $136.46 on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing said its decision to slow down payments to suppliers this year was an important strategic move to align its payment processes with industry standards. Reuters reported the change on July 7. The shift has ruffled suppliers, including Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N) and GKN Plc (GKN.L), which noted it recently. Boeing declined to say whether the change had contributed to an 11 percent rise in its cash to $9.3 billion in the quarter, or how it might affect cash generation in the future.""This is not a one-time event or implementation,"" Chief Executive Officer Dennis Muilenburg said in response to questions on a conference call. ""We see this as a key element of our longer-term cash growth plan and consistent with our plans for the business to grow cash year over year."" Muilenburg also said Boeing would rather curb production than cut prices for twin-aisle aircraft to deal with slowing demand. The company ""clearly has work to do"" to sell 40 of its 777s this year, having only sold eight so far, he said.""If those orders don't materialize, we're going to keep a close eye on our production plans and make sure supply and demand remain in balance,"" he said.But he added: ""We don't need to make drastic changes to pricing in order to capture market share. In the wide-body market, even though we're seeing hesitation in buying, the value proposition is holding up well.""  Boeing lifted production of 787s to 12 a month in the quarter, sooner than expected, but has not set a date for boosting output to the next target level of 14 a month.Boeing's results reflected better profitability in its defense, space and security business. While revenue in the unit fell 5 percent, profit rose 9 percent. Margins at the commercial airplanes unit widened to 10.3 percent, excluding the one-time charges, versus 7.1 percent a year ago. Defense margins widened to 8.3 percent, with the tanker charge included, from 7.2 percent. Deliveries of twin-aisle 787s and 777s rose 12 percent and 8 percent, respectively, in the quarter. But the company is delivering fewer 737s as it begins production of the successor 737 MAX jet.Those deliveries are expected to rise next year once the new plane is certified and begins service. That is now expected in the first half, rather than the third quarter as targeted previously.

451,"   By Alwyn Scott  After two years of looking to expand, aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins Inc has struck a deal to buy aircraft interior maker B/E Aerospace Inc for $62 a share in cash and stock, the companies said on Sunday.The acquisition, valued at $6.4 billion plus the assumption of $1.9 billion in debt, expands the range of products Rockwell Collins supplies to major commercial and business aircraft and broadens its customer base internationally.Rockwell on Sunday also reported a 14 percent increase in profit to $1.58 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, on a 4 percent rise in sales.The acquisition, which is expected to be completed next spring, allows both companies to sell to each other’s customers and to deploy Rockwell’s capability with onboard connectivity to make internet-enabled seats, galleys, lavatories and other cabin systems that B/E Aerospace provides.“B/E is very strong in relationships with airlines,” Rockwell Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg said in an interview. “We're stronger with aircraft makers as well as business aviation operators and the military. We’ll be able to sell our respective products into a much broader market base than either of us could do independently.”B/E Aerospace plans to use Rockwell’s dealer network and relationships with business jet owners, for example, to know when jets are coming in for avionics upgrades.“Having that information and time to market directly to the owners of the aircraft is a tremendous opportunity that we're looking to take advantage of,” said Amin Khoury, B/E Aerospace founder and chairman. “It's not something we can do on our own.” The combination is expected to produce cost savings of about $160 million, with 90 percent captured in the first full year of the acquisition, and provide a double-digit percentage boost to per-share earnings in the first full year, the companies said. They also anticipate it generating more than $6 billion in free cash flow over five years.The cost savings come from eliminating public company administration at B/E Aerospace, greater buying power with suppliers, consolidating information technology system and using low-cost factory labor across the combined company, Ortberg said.LITTLE PRODUCT OVERLAP  Rockwell agreed to pay $34.10 a share in cash and $27.90 in shares of Rockwell Collins stock, a 22.5 percent premium to B/E Aerospace's closing price on Friday.The purchase will curb Rockwell’s appetite for big deals for about three years, but the company will still be looking for smaller acquisitions while paying down debt, Ortberg said.The companies have little product overlap. Rockwell is best known for avionics, flight control systems and cabin connectivity, while B/E Aerospace is a major provider of aircraft seats, galleys, lighting and other systems.Rockwell, based in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has market value of about $11 billion, more than twice the size of Wellington, Florida-based B/E Aerospace, which has a market value of $5.1 billion. The offer represents a 22.5 percent premium to B/E Aerospace's closing price on Friday. B/E Aerospace brings more aftermarket and aircraft retrofit business to Rockwell, which is mainly focused on new equipment, and also adds exposure to twin-aisle aircraft, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at the Teal Group.Combined sales will be about evenly split between the U.S. domestic market and international markets, Ortberg said.Pricing pressures from Boeing Co and Airbus are one driver of such a deal. ""But it's also a pretty clear indicator that the market has peaked in terms of deliveries and orders,"" Aboulafia said of new aircraft sales. ""In this environment, consolidation is inevitable as a cost-control move.""Ortberg said that while cost was a factor, ""It’s really the transition to the digital airplane that's creating the perfect timing to bring these two entities together.”Rockwell’s board set up a committee two years ago to examine whether to grow by expanding into new markets or partnering to use existing sales channels. “We thought that (latter strategy) was a much better approach,” he said.

The STOXX 600 was up 0.5 percent at 345.97, having ended Friday flat. Last week it posted its biggest weekly rise since mid-September, up 1.3 percent.Zodiac Aerospace rose 3 percent and was among the top risers on the index in early deals. It benefited from merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in its sector, with Rockwell Collins  striking a deal to buy B/E Aerospace for $62 a share in cash and stock on Sunday.Media and broadcast firms were also in focus, with ITV  up 2.3 percent and Sky up 1.5 percent, after AT&T Inc agreed to buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion over the weekend.French Connection rose 15 percent after the Telegraph reported that there was interest from the United States in a takeover of the UK fashion firm.""We have seen a stronger open this morning after more corporate activity in the US, which will help the media names in the session,"" said Atif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers. ""Also French Connection private equity talk is helping M&A activity (and) this will become a theme given the advantages of the FX weakness allowing more UK listed names to become attractive targets.""However, M&A didn't squarely support the market, as a couple of high profile deals by Chinese firms to take over European companies hit major roadblocks.Syngenta fell 8.6 percent after the EU said that ChemChina had missed a deadline to offer concessions to regulators regarding its $43 billion bid for the Swiss pesticides and seeds group.In another example of the scrutiny that such acquisitions are under from regulators, the German government withdrew its approval for a Chinese takeover of chip equipment maker Aixtron , throwing up an unexpected hurdle for a 670-million-euro ($728 million) deal on the home stretch. Shares in Aixtron were down 6.2 percent.Bank stocks were up 1 percent, and the sector recouped all of its losses since Britain voted to leave the European Union in June.BNP Paribas rose 1.1 percent to its highest level so far this year. Analysts said that its high exposure to fixed income, currency and commodity (FICC) trading should benefit the bank, following stellar results in that department when the major U.S. banks reported earnings last week.BNP Paribas' latest quarterly results are due on Friday.Spanish banks were among the top risers in the sector, and Spain's IBEX was up 1.2 percent, hitting a six-month high and outperforming as the country looked set end a 10-month period of political deadlock.Spain's conservative leader Mariano Rajoy looked set to secure a second term in power for his People's Party after his Socialist rivals agreed to abstain in a looming confidence vote on Sunday.Top individual riser on the STOXX 600 was Philips, up 4.3 percent after its results.Among the big fallers, aerospace and defence firm Cobham  fell 18 percent after it issued its second profit warning in six months.

461,"  Activist investor Starboard Value LP has acquired a stake in aircraft component maker Rockwell Collins Inc (COL.N) and is questioning its $6.4 billion purchase of B/E Aerospace Inc (BEAV.O), a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday, citing sources, that Starboard had asked Rockwell Collins to explore alternative options, including selling itself. Rockwell Collins has yet to receive any formal letter from Starboard, the source said.The source asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Rockwell's shares were up 2.7 percent at $95.20 in extended trading on Wednesday, while B/E Aerospace was down 3.4 percent at $58.00.""We remain confident that the acquisition of B/E Aerospace will create significant value for our shareholders,"" a Rockwell spokeswoman said. ""We're excited to bring together these two industry leaders and look forward to closing this transformative transaction in the spring of 2017.""   In October, Rockwell Collins struck a deal to buy aircraft interior maker B/E Aerospace, to expand the range of products Rockwell Collins supplies to major commercial and business aircraft. The companies have little product overlap, with Rockwell best known for avionics, flight controls and cabin connectivity, while B/E Aerospace is a major provider of aircraft seats, galleys, lighting and other systems.Starboard and B/E Aerospace did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Up to Wednesday's close, Rockwell's shares had risen about 10 percent since Oct. 21, the last trading day before the deal was announced, while B/E Aerospace's increased about 19 percent.

468,"   By Jonathan Stempel  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday charged four San Francisco-area men with insider trading in Ross Stores Inc stock options, and one of the four with insider trading in stock options of a company that was later bought by Oracle Corp.The alleged scheme resulted in more than $12.6 million of illegal profit and was centered on Saleem Khan, a former finance manager at a healthcare nonprofit, according to the regulator.Khan will begin a 1-3/4 year prison term on June 23 after pleading guilty in an unrelated case, court records show.According to the SEC, former Ross finance executive Roshanlal Chaganlal from 2009 through 2012 routinely tipped Khan about the apparel retailer's monthly sales results.Khan allegedly used the tips to make $11.4 million by trading Ross stock options for himself and his brother-in-law, and through intermediaries kicked $130,000 back to Chaganlal. The regulator said Khan also provided inside tips about Ross to his supervisor Ranjan Mendonsa and colleague Ammar Akbari, who made a respective $800,000 and $2,000 in Ross stock options.Khan was also accused by the SEC of making $450,000 by using tips from an Oracle insider to trade Taleo Corp stock options in the six days before Oracle agreed on Feb. 9, 2012 to buy that software company for $1.9 billion, an 18 percent premium.The SEC said Khan, Chaganlal and Akbari live in Dublin, California, where Ross is based, while Mendonsa lives in nearby San Ramon. It said they invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination during the agency's probe. Khan's lawyer, Chris Cannon, said: ""Saleem has made hundreds of short-term trades in Ross, many of which were unprofitable, and if he were trading on inside tips he would have been able to avoid the unprofitable trades.""Martin Sabelli, a lawyer for Chaganlal, declined to comment.

Investors had been hoping that Yellen would catapult the S&P to the milestone 2,000 level.While Russia has maintained the trucks contain humanitarian aid, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen condemned the move as an ""alarming build-up."" He called on Russia to ""stop destabilizing Ukraine.""""People are thinking maybe the convoy sent wasn't in line with an acknowledgment of a Red Cross-led endeavor and was something taken on by Russia unilaterally, which has reestablished a little bit of investor anxiety,"" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Markets were also pressured by comments from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where Yellen and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi delivered remarks on the labor market.  Yellen did not give a timeline for Fed interest rate hikes, saying that with slack remaining in the labor market, ""there is no simple recipe for appropriate policy.""The comments ""were more hawkish than what the market was anticipating"" because Yellen kept the Fed's ability to hike interest rates sooner than expected on the table, said Karyn Cavanaugh, senior market strategist with Voya Investment Management.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 38.27 points, or 0.22 percent, to 17,001.22, the S&P 500 ended down 3.97 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,988.4 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 6.45 points, or 0.14 percent, to 4,538.55. Despite the day's losses, all three major indexes posted gains for the week, with the Dow up 2 percent, the S&P up 1.7 percent and the Nasdaq up 1.6 percent. It was the strongest week of gains for both the Dow and the S&P since April, and the third straight week of gains for all three indexes.Retailers moved higher, led by a 7.4 percent advance in Ross Stores to $74.37 after the apparel and home fashion retailer posted second-quarter results.

SMOOTH SAILING AHEAD Royal Caribbean said it expected smoother sailing in the coming quarters as bookings were seen rising and demand for its Chinese and European cruises was expected to stay strong.The company said it expected double-digit percentage rise in yields in its Europe and Asia Pacific cruises this year.Europe cruises account for 22 percent of the company's capacity, while Asia Pacific sailings make for 12 percent.

486,"   By Zachary Fagenson | MIAMI  MIAMI Retired English soccer captain David Beckham lobbied Miami lawmakers on Wednesday to approve his proposed 25,000-seat soccer stadium on the city's prized bayfront real estate.Beckham, wearing a tailored dark suit, went door-to-door in Miami-Dade lawmakers’ offices in downtown Miami throughout the morning and afternoon, meeting with commissioners and posing for pictures.Beckham's plan for a futuristic, waterfront stadium near the port of Miami to house a new Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise has run into resistance from a group led by Royal Caribbean Cruises, which argues that it would interfere with cruise and cargo operations.An alternative proposal offered by Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez this week would locate the stadium on another nearby downtown waterfront site, currently a boatslip, sandwiched between an art museum and the Miami Heat basketball arena.“If they want to have a piece of property there ... they would have to bear the cost of filling the slip in,” Gimenez said, pegging the cost between $12 million and $18 million. Gimenez said the land could be worth as much as $50 million.""It's another option it gives us another location which has come out of the blue,"" Beckham told reporters outside county hall on Wednesday.""It's gone from having one great possible location to two. We’re very happy."" Beckham said he never expected a ""smooth ride"" getting stadium approval. ""Investors and I will be putting up a quarter of a billion dollars ... we don't want to bring worries,"" he said.Beckham along with his partners Simon Fuller, creator of American Idol, and Bolivian-born billionaire Marcelo Claure, founder of Miami-based Brightstar Corp, say they will pay the county tax and rent. The group plans to privately finance the $250 million stadium construction. Beckham has yet to reveal who his investors are.The mayor's alternative plan has already drawn the ire of several critics, including former Miami Mayor Manny Diaz and a handful of former city commissioners who said the space should become parks and plazas for the tens of thousands of downtown Miami residents now living in the city’s high rises that once sat empty following the city and nation’s real estate collapse.“Miami has become one of the world’s leading urban centers, fulfilling its long awaited destiny ... let us not purge this gift by building a stadium where it does not belong,” Diaz wrote in a widely circulated Wednesday email.

The firm did not disclose the vessel's price but analysts estimate that its previous Oasis-class ships cost around $1.4 billion each. Royal Caribbean also said it now sees capital expenditure of $6.8 billion through 2018, up from an earlier guidance for $5 billion through 2017. Royal Caribbean last month raised its earnings guidance on a strong rise in bookings, in a signal that the global cruise industry is slowly recovering from several lean years. The vessel will be built by STX France, 66.6 percent-owned by STX and 33.3 percent by the French state.The first two Oasis-class ships were built in Turku, Finland while the third vessel, two tonnes bigger than its sisters, is being built in Saint-Nazaire, France.

489,"   By David Adams | MIAMI  MIAMI Forced to rethink the location of a stadium for his proposed Major League Soccer team, retired England captain David Beckham is forging ahead with plans for a new site next to the Miami Heat basketball arena.Representatives of Miami Beckham United on Monday met with the mayors of the city of Miami and Miami-Dade county and outlined plans for a stadium that would be sandwiched between two new museums and the basketball arena on Biscayne Bay.Beckham's group has insisted on a downtown waterfront site to win approval for the Miami franchise from the board of governors of Major League Soccer, the top professional division in the United States. Beckham, who starred with Manchester United, England and Real Madrid, also played with Los Angeles Galaxy in MLS for five years until the end of 2012. Beckham's group has agreed to finance a $250 million stadium with seating for 20,000 and to pay rent for the land.The proposal still has to be vetted by city and county commissioners and undergo public hearings before being put to a referendum later this year. Beckham’s initial preferred site for the stadium, an undeveloped plot of land on the port of Miami, was resisted by  Royal Caribbean Cruises and others who argued the stadium could interfere with cruise and cargo operations.Miami Mayor Tomás Regalado told reporters after Monday's meeting that the new proposal involved filling in a large boat slip creating extra park land by the bay, including a public walkway between the stadium and the water. ""I liked it because we are gaining more park land and we will make money,"" Regalado said.

Growth in net yield was driven by fewer discounts on last-minute bookings, the company said.An improvement in pricing is expected to help the company in the next two quarters, Morningstar analyst Jaime Katz said.Lower fuel costs also helped the company beat the average profit estimate for the second straight quarter. Fuel costs accounted for 9.8 percent of total revenue in the second quarter ended June 30, down from 12.2 percent a year earlier.Crude oil prices have slumped more than 40 percent since June last year, reducing fuel costs for cruise operators and airlines.Royal Caribbean, which owns Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises and Azamara Club Cruises, raised its profit forecast for the year to $4.65-$4.75 per share from $4.45-$4.65.Analysts on average were expecting $4.61 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income rose 34 percent to $185 million, or 84 cents per share, in the second quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of 73 cents.Total revenue rose 4 percent to $2.06 billion, in line with estimates.The company's shares were up more than 8 percent at $89.58 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. They hit a record high of $90.81 earlier in the session.

A sharp selloff in Chinese shares over the past weeks has stoked concerns about a slowdown in growth in the world's second-biggest economy.""Essentially they (commodities) have been on the downtrend for a month and of course we have been on a roller coaster ride in China equities and that has affected sentiment,"" said Societe Generale strategist Alvin Tan.Wall Street ended flat on Thursday as investors digested ho-hum corporate earnings and new data showed that economic growth accelerated in the second quarter.With more than half of the S&P 500 companies having reported quarterly results, analysts expect overall earnings to edge up 1 percent and revenue to decline 3.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.

529,"  (Corrects eighth paragraph to make clear that only one of the two lawsuits seeks class-action status, and identifies that lawsuit in tenth paragraph)By Jonathan StempelFeb 25 Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd faces at least two lawsuits by passengers accusing the company of negligently endangering their lives by letting its Anthem of the Seas cruise ship sail into a fierce Atlantic storm this month.The lawsuits filed in the U.S. District Court in Miami claim that Royal Caribbean knew, or should have known, that a coastal storm carrying hurricane-force winds had been forecast before the ship set sail from Cape Liberty, New Jersey on Feb. 6 for a scheduled seven-night cruise to the Bahamas.Nonetheless, Royal Caribbean chose to sail the ship into the storm, motivated by a desire to profit at the expense of the safety of roughly 4,500 passengers and 1,600 crew, the lawsuits said.Cynthia Martinez, a Royal Caribbean spokeswoman, said the Miami-based company does not discuss pending litigation, and has taken steps to minimize the risk of another similar incident. Royal Caribbean has said the storm was more severe than expected.Passengers hunkered in their rooms as the Anthem of the Seas encountered high winds and 30-foot waves off the North Carolina coast, a day after its departure. Royal Caribbean later turned the ship around, and it returned to New Jersey on Feb. 10. The company offered passengers full refunds, and discounts on a future cruise.One of the lawsuits seeks class-action status for passengers, and both lawsuits seek unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.The first lawsuit was filed on Feb. 18 by Bruce Simpson, a Delaware resident who claimed to suffer a concussion and other injuries after being thrown 18 feet into a door when the ship pitched violently. The second lawsuit, the proposed class action, was filed on Thursday by Frank DeLuca, of Cinnaminson, New Jersey, who suffered back injuries during the voyage, and whose wife has suffered from panic attacks and sleeplessness, their lawyer Michael Winkleman said.""Royal Caribbean showed an absolute lack of respect for the lives of its passengers,"" Winkleman said in a phone interview. A refund and a future cruise credit is insulting for what the passengers went through.""Simpson's lawyer was not immediately available for comment.The cases are Simpson v.

552,"  Veteran Raymond Floyd will be a vice-captain on this year's American Ryder Cup team, U.S. captain Tom Watson said on Tuesday.Floyd, 71, won four majors, including two U.S. PGA Championships, during a decorated career.Eight-times major winner Watson had previously announced that twice U.S. Open champion Andy North would be a vice-captain.The Ryder Cup will be played at Gleneagles, Scotland from September 26-28.Europe are defending champions in the biennial event, which the U.S. have not won in Europe since 1993, when Watson previously was captain. Watson selected Floyd as a player back then.""What Raymond brings is experience and respect of the players,"" Watson said in making the announcement at Riviera Country Club, site of this week's Northern Trust Open.""When these players look at Raymond, they know he's been there, they know he's been successful.""You look at Raymond's eyes, you never saw his eyes waver... His eyes had a focus you like to see and the way he played the game, every shot counted, and that's the type of guy I wanted taking care of my back.Floyd played in eight Ryder Cup teams, compiling a 12-16-3 record, and he captained the 1989 side who tied with Europe. ""I'm flattered obviously and it's going to be a thrill for me to be back,"" Floyd said via telephone.Floyd said he had never met several likely players on the team, but he did not believe that was a problem.""Our responsibilities are to see that (the players) are comfortable (and) if there are any questions they have to be comfortable coming to us,"" he said.Floyd was an assistant on Paul Azinger's winning American team in 2008. There is no limit on how many assistants a captain has. Davis Love had four when he captained the American team two years ago and Watson said he might add another one.Either way, Watson does not think any inspirational speeches will be necessary, considering the U.S. surrendered a four-point point lead on the final day to lose two years ago.""The main motivation is the fact we lost the last one. We had a big lead and we lost it. If that's not enough motivation for the players of the 2014 Ryder Cup team, we're spinning our wheels,"" he said.""What a crushing defeat. What a pit that left in my stomach for several days afterwards.""

553,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, February 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects to rate Ryder System Inc.'s  (Ryder) 5 1/2-year, $350 million senior unsecured notes 'A-'. Fitch does not  believe there will be a material impact on Ryder's leverage as a result of the  issuance, as proceeds are expected to be used to refinance term debt outstanding  and for general corporate purposes. A full list of rating actions is at the end  of this rating action commentary. KEY RATING DRIVERS The expected rating is equalized with the ratings assigned to Ryder's existing  senior unsecured debt as the new notes will rank equally in the capital  structure. The equalization of Ryder's unsecured debt with its long-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) reflects the company's 100% unsecured funding profile.  Ryder's ratings reflect its established market position in the truck leasing  business, its operating consistency, strong liquidity and funding profile,  relatively low leverage, and solid capitalization. Rating constraints include  the company's pension burden, cyclicality inherent in used vehicle pricing and  the commercial rental business, and the regulatory impact on business trends.  Ryder currently has a Stable Outlook, which reflects Fitch's expectation for  continued economical access to the capital markets through market cycles, strong  liquidity, solid capitalization, and earnings growth in 2014 driven by an  increase in full-service lease activity and organic growth in supply chain  solutions. RATING SENSITIVITIES While Fitch believes positive rating action is likely limited over the medium  term, positive rating momentum could result from greater revenue diversification  and lower leverage.  Negative rating action could be driven by a decline in earnings and/or free cash  flow beyond Fitch's expectations which yields an increase in leverage beyond the  targeted range and/or indicates a weakened competitive position in the industry.  Additionally, deterioration in asset quality, an inability to realize residual  values on used vehicles, a material increase in non-earning vehicles, and/or a  decline in liquidity could result in negative rating action.  A material shift to secured funding could affect the notching between the  long-term IDR and the unsecured debt rating.  Established in 1933 and headquartered in Miami, Florida, Ryder is one of the  world's largest providers of highway transportation services. As of Dec. 31,  2013, the company had 161,100 vehicles in its full-service and commercial rental  fleet and generated $6.4 billion of revenue during 2013. Ryder's stock is listed  on the NYSE under the ticker 'R'. Fitch expects to assign the following rating:  Ryder System's Inc.:  --$350 million senior unsecured notes due 2019 'A-'. Fitch currently rates Ryder System's Inc. as follows: --Long-Term IDR 'A-'; --Short-Term IDR 'F2'; --Commercial Paper rating 'F2';  --Senior unsecured notes 'A-'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

554,"  May 25 Ryder System Inc's shares could rise 30 percent in a year as the truck rental company continues to attract first-time leases and expands its out-sourced maintenance services, Barron's financial newspaper said in its latest issue.Ryder looks likely to grow its earnings at a double-digit clip over the next few years, while the S&P 500's earnings growth has recently slowed to near zero, the newspaper said. (on.barrons.com/1Rg0j3w)First-time leases are contributing about a third of the growth of leases overall, the company's biggest money maker, Barron's said. Wall Street expects Ryder's earnings to grow 17 percent this year, to $6.50 a share, and to top $8 in 2017, Barron's said. A rise to $125 per share in a year would put Ryder's shares at about 17 times forward earnings, where the S&P 500 trades now, the newspaper said. That is assuming that estimates stay put and Ryder, which has topped estimates in each quarter over the past three years, merely meets them, Barron's said.

560,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, October 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long- and Short-Term  Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder) at 'A-'/ 'F2',  following the completion of its fleet leasing peer review. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS  IDRS AND SENIOR DEBT The ratings are supported by Ryder's established market position in the truck  leasing business, growing market share in the logistics and supply chain  solutions (SCS) business, good asset quality, relatively consistent operating  performance through various cycles, appropriate leverage, solid liquidity, and a  largely unsecured funding profile. Rating constraints specific to Ryder include the company's pension obligation,  which can have an impact on balance sheet leverage, and customer concentrations  in the SCS segment. Rating constraints applicable to the broader truck leasing  sector include cyclicality inherent in used vehicle pricing and the commercial  rental business and potential regulatory impact on business trends.  The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation for continued economic access to  the capital markets through various market cycles, limited sensitivity to rising  interest rates, strong liquidity, appropriate leverage, and continued earnings  growth over the Outlook horizon, driven by growth in full-service lease and  contract maintenance revenue, as well as increased penetration in the supply  chain outsourcing business. Asset Quality Mean Reversion Expected Ryder's asset quality and equipment valuation metrics are strongly influenced by  the general condition of the domestic economy. Net accounts receivables  write-offs were 1.43% in 2015, and modestly higher than the five-year average of  1.06% and which Fitch believes remains relatively low. Mean reversion is  expected in the medium term, as Fitch views asset quality performance at current  historical lows as unsustainable. That said, write-offs are not expected to  approach peak levels experienced in 2009. The company reported average gains on the sale of trucks, tractors, and trailers  of 23.8% between 2011 and 2015. Gains on sales of equipment have been elevated  in recent years given strong demand by buyers to purchase pre-2010 engines.  Sales gains in the first-half of 2016 (1H16) declined 45.6% year-over-year,  reflecting lower used vehicle pricing, offset by higher sales volume. Fitch  expects gains on sale will continue to moderate in the medium- to longer-term  given normalization of used vehicle pricing from historical highs.  Relatively Consistent Operating Performance Ryder reported 6% operating revenue growth in 1H16, reflecting higher revenue  across all operating segments, partially offset by a negative impact from  foreign exchange. Pre-tax income decreased 6% to $205.5 million in 1H16, due to  lower commercial rental revenue and reduced gains on used vehicle sales,  partially offset by higher full-service lease results, lower insurance costs in  dedicated transportation solutions (DTS), and increased pricing, new business,  and increased volumes in DTS and SCS.  This translated into annualized pre-tax return on assets of 3.7%, which is  modestly below the five-year average of 4%. Fitch expects operating performance  to remain relatively consistent in 2H16, supported by growth in full-service  leasing, tight management of fleet inventories, and controlling costs amid a  weaker environment for rentals, and lower used vehicle prices. Fitch believes interest rate sensitivity is relatively limited for Ryder as  rental contracts are typically short term and increased funding costs can be  passed through to the full-service lease customers. However, there is a slight  lag on the leasing side given that contracts are typically intermediate-term;  however, Ryder seeks to mitigate this by issuing term debt in an attempt to  match-fund that portion of the business. Appropriate Leverage Ryder has an articulated long-term leverage target, defined as managed  debt-to-equity including the present value of capital lease obligations of  2.25x-2.75x. Managed leverage amounted to 2.75x, as of June 30, 2016, which is  within the target but modestly higher than the average of 2.54x since 2011, as  capital expenditures have been funded with increased borrowings in recent years.  For leasing companies, Fitch focuses on managed debt-to-tangible equity in its  analysis of leverage. On this basis, leverage amounted to 3.51x as of June 30,  2016, which is consistent with the average of 3.59x since 2011.  Ryder's pension obligation is viewed as having a potential negative impact to  the company's leverage profile given the accumulated net pension equity charge  (after tax) of $577 million, which was due to the underfunded status (79% as of  end-2015) of its defined benefit plans. Even so, Fitch expects leverage to  decline toward the midpoint of Ryder's articulated range by end-2016, driven by  retained earnings generation and lower capital expenditures. Fitch believes  Ryder's leverage metrics are appropriate for its current ratings, and  incorporate the expectation that Ryder will scale or pull-back on repurchase  activity, as necessary, to manage leverage within its long-term target. In December 2015, Ryder reinstated its antidilutive share repurchase program,  which allows the company to repurchase up to 2 million shares of common stock in  periodic, open-market transactions. In 1H16, the company repurchased a total of  321,718 shares at an average price per share of $68.05. We do not expect further  material repurchases of common stock given that managed leverage is already near  the top of Ryder's articulated range.   Solid Liquidity Profile Fitch views Ryder's liquidity as solid, supported by the substantial cash  generating capability of the operating lease portfolio. While free cash flow  (FCF) generation was negative for 6M16, this is attributable to the firm  investing primarily in full-service lease assets which are expected to generate  meaningful cash earnings. When lease and/or rental demand declines, the firm has  historically managed its fleet down quickly, resulting in positive FCF and an  ability to de-lever, as was observed during the recent financial crisis.  In addition, corporate credit facilities serve as a source of contingent  liquidity. Ryder has a $1.2 billion global revolving credit facility provided by  a syndicate of 12 banks, which also serves as a backstop to its commercial paper  issuance. Borrowing availability under the facility amounted to $425 million, as  of June 30, 2016. Based on unrestricted cash of $66 million and estimated  annualized operating cash flow of $1.5 billion, Ryder would have sufficient  liquidity to address near-term debt maturities of $1.1 billion in the next 12  months.  Continued Funding Flexibility Ryder is predominately funded through unsecured debt, which represented around  92% of total funding as of June 30, 2016. This is viewed positively by Fitch, as  available unencumbered assets improve balance sheet flexibility in times of  market stress. Sale-leaseback transactions and capital leases represented 8% of  total funding. Borrowings from these sources have been modest, but remain  important for Ryder, as they provide additional funding diversity. The company has demonstrated strong access to various funding sources through a  variety of market cycles. In 1H16, Ryder issued $300 million of unsecured  medium-term notes maturing in November 2021. The proceeds from the issuance were  used to repay maturing debt and for general corporate purposes. Fitch believes  Ryder will continue to opportunistically access the capital markets to maintain  funding diversity and optimize pricing. RATING SENSITIVITIES IDRS AND SENIOR DEBT Fitch believes positive rating actions are limited over the medium term.  However, positive rating momentum could develop over the longer term from  greater revenue diversification, stronger liquidity, and lower tangible balance  sheet leverage.  Conversely, negative rating actions could be driven by an increase in tangible  balance sheet leverage resulting from a decline in earnings and/or free cash  flow beyond Fitch's expectations, or a substantial pension charge which inflates  leverage meaningfully beyond the targeted range for an extended period. In  addition, deterioration in the firm's competitive position, weaker asset quality  metrics, an inability to realize residual values on used vehicles, a material  increase in non-earning vehicles, and/or a decline in liquidity could also  result in negative rating actions.  Established in 1933 and headquartered in Miami, FL, Ryder is one of the world's  largest providers of highway transportation services. The company's stock is  listed on the NYSE under the ticker 'R'. Fitch has affirmed the ratings as follows:  Ryder System, Inc. --Long-Term IDR at 'A-'; --Short-Term IDR at 'F2'; --Commercial paper at 'F2'; --Senior unsecured debt at 'A-'.

Fitch Affirms Ryder System's Ratings at 'A-/F2' Following Peer Review; Outlook  Stable Fitch Ratings, New York, 10 October 2016: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Long-  and Short-Term Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of Ryder System, Inc.

Relatively Consistent Operating Performance Ryder reported 6% operating revenue growth in 1H16, reflecting higher revenue  across all operating segments, partially offset by a negative impact from  foreign exchange. Pre-tax income decreased 6% to $205.5 million in 1H16, due to  lower commercial rental revenue and reduced gains on used vehicle sales,  partially offset by higher full-service lease results, lower insurance costs in  dedicated transportation solutions (DTS), and increased pricing, new business,  and increased volumes in DTS and SCS.

For leasing companies, Fitch focuses on managed debt-to-tangible equity in its  analysis of leverage. On this basis, leverage amounted to 3.51x as of June 30,  2016, which is consistent with the average of 3.59x since 2011.  Ryder's pension obligation is viewed as having a potential negative impact to  the company's leverage profile given the accumulated net pension equity charge  (after tax) of $577 million, which was due to the underfunded status (79% as of  end-2015) of its defined benefit plans.

The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors.

569,"  (Adds details from conference call, updates share price)By Sruthi RamakrishnanFeb 27 Salesforce.com Inc raised its full-year revenue forecast and said it aims to improve its adjusted operating margin, after quarterly revenue grew more than expected on strong sales at ExactTarget, an email marketing firm it acquired in June.The world's biggest maker of online sales software on Thursday estimated revenue of $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion for the year ending January 2015, compared with its previous forecast of $5.15 billion to $5.2 billion.Salesforce forecast adjusted earnings of 48-50 cents per share for the full year.That was largely below analysts' average estimate of 50 cents per share for the full year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The full-year adjusted profit forecast implies adjusted operating margin growth of 125 to 150 basis points, and assumes no significant mergers and acquisitions by Salesforce for the year ending January 2015.Adjusted profit for the year ended January was 35 cents per share.""We are committed to improving non-GAAP profitability by 125 to 150 basis points, which is a huge goal of mine for this year and increasing cash flow growth this,"" Chief Executive Marc Benioff said on a conference call with analysts. Salesforce aims to keep delivering topline growth at an ""outstanding"" pace, he added. Benioff said in November that he would seek to balance ""growth and profitability"" without jeopardizing his company's ""outrageous"" pace of revenue expansion.Benioff, who founded Salesforce in 1999, has for years shrugged off calls from Wall Street to turn a bigger profit by arguing that it was more important to re-invest earnings to increase its market share.The San Francisco-based company also said its chief financial officer of six years, Graham Smith, would retire in 2015. Salesforce shares, which had closed at $66.20 on the New York Stock Exchange, dropped 3 percent to $64 after hours but later pared losses to trade at $65.98.The company's net loss widened to $116.6 million, or 19 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 31, from $20.8 million, or 4 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned 7 cents per share, one cent higher than analysts' expectations.Revenue rose 37 percent to $1.15 billion and beat analysts' expectations of $1.13 billion.Salesforce's unbilled deferred revenue, a critical measure of contracts that have been closed with business customers but remain off-balance sheet, rose to $4.5 billion, up 29 percent from a year earlier.

570,"  SAN FRANCISCO, March 25 Chuck Ganapathi, the executive behind Salesforce's popular Chatter software, is starting a company that takes aim at that company's core focus of managing business relationships.Tactile, a service launching on Tuesday, aims to automatically synchronize email, calendar, tasks, Salesforce data, LinkedIn contacts, Twitter and other functions. It will help salespeople and other users manage data, Ganapathi said in an interview last week.He has raised $11.2 million from Redpoint Ventures and Accel Partners, the venture firm where he worked as entrepreneur in residence while he developed the idea for Tactile. ""There was no better place to think about it because they are the ones who funded Dropbox,"" he said, referring to the startup he drew inspiration from. Dropbox, widely considered an initial public offering candidate for later this year, allows users to synchronize files automatically to the cloud, so the files can be accessed from anywhere rather than a specific set of computers. Ganapathi said Redwood City, Calif.-based Tactile will be more complimentary than competitive with services such as Dropbox and Salesforce. Dozens of enterprise-application software startups are trying to tap into a market that research firm Gartner estimated would total $142.8 billion dollars in 2014. Base, Intercom, Nimble, and Pipedrive make up a handful of the startups competing in various aspects of customer-relations management.Accel's Kevin Efrusy, a former classmate of Ganapathi's at Stanford University's graduate school of business, will join Tactile's board, as will Redpoint Ventures' Satish Dharmaraj.

In a demonstration of the platform, the companies showed how a nurse could remotely use a networked weighing scale and a pill dispensing box to assist elderly patients.Van Houten said he expected insurance companies would be keen to fund the use of networked healthcare devices because of potential cost savings.""There's a huge amount of money in the healthcare ecosystem; it's 17 percent of U.S. GDP,"" he said.

598,"  PARIS, March 30 European stocks were set to rise on Monday, bouncing back from last week's losses with tech shares in focus after news of merger talks in the sector spurred a late-session rally on Wall Street on Friday.     Intel Corp is in talks to buy fellow chipmaker Altera Corp  in a deal likely to top $10 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter, which would make it Intel's biggest acquisition ever and the latest merger in the quickly consolidating semiconductor sector.      Intel shares jumped 6.4 percent on Friday, making it the biggest boost to the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes, while Altera shares surged 28.4 percent. Infineon, STMicroelectronics, ARM and ASML feature among Europe's biggest chipmakers and chipmaking production equipment makers.     At 0650 GMT, futures for Euro STOXX 50, for Germany's DAX  and for France's CAC were up 0.4-0.5 percent.     Market sentiment on Monday was also supported by recent central bank comments.     Weekend comments from Chinese central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan reinforced expectations for further monetary easing to support the country's slowing economy.      On Friday, Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled that the U.S. central bank will likely start raising borrowing costs later this year, but emphasized the return to normal interest rates will be gradual.      ""The cautious tone that she struck stating that there was no set path, completely dependant on the data, and the fact that she highlighted the risks of raising rates too quickly as greater than leaving them low for too long is also set to play in to the hands of the bulls this morning,"" Capital Spreads trader Jonathan Sudaria wrote in a note.     Greek shares will be in the spotlight again after Greece and its international creditors continued talks through the weekend on reforms to unlock loans and Athens sounded an upbeat tone, but the lenders said it could take several more days before a proper list of measures was ready.           ------------------------------------------------------------------------------   MARKET SNAPSHOT AT 0650 GMT:                                          LAST   PCT CHG  NET CHG  S&P 500                             2,061.02    0.24 %     4.87  NIKKEI                               19411.4    0.65 %   125.77  MSCI ASIA EX-JP                        484.5    0.43 %     2.07  EUR/USD                               1.0866   -0.19 %  -0.0021  USD/JPY                               119.28    0.15 %   0.1800  10-YR US TSY YLD                       1.953        --     0.01  10-YR BUND YLD                         0.195        --    -0.01  SPOT GOLD                          $1,193.20   -0.47 %   -$5.60  US CRUDE                              $48.01   -1.76 %    -0.86   > GLOBAL MARKETS-Asia shares swing higher as China nears 7-yr high    > US STOCKS-Wall St ends 4-day skid on late tech rally    > Nikkei up in choppy trade; airline shares outperform on weak oil prices    > TREASURIES-Bond prices rally on month-end buying, hold gains after    > FOREX-Dollar supported even as Yellen drives home message of patience    > PRECIOUS-Gold slips as Yellen signals U.S. rate hike on track    > METALS-London nickel slides to lowest since 2009 on weak demand    > Oil prices fall as Iran, world powers seek nuclear deal           COMPANY NEWS:          TECH SHARES      Intel Corp is in talks to buy fellow chipmaker Altera Corp  in a deal likely to top $10 billion, according to a source familiar with the matter, making it Intel's biggest purchase ever and the latest merger in the quickly consolidating semiconductor sector.

602,"   By Bill Rigby | REDWOOD CITY, Calif.  REDWOOD CITY, Calif. Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) Chief Executive Safra Catz said her company could benefit if Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) or another rival bought online customer relationship management firm Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N).Oracle, Microsoft and Germany's SAP (SAPG.DE) are the most likely candidates for such a big deal, according to analysts, which could top $50 billion and be the biggest software acquisition on record. Each of the companies have declined to comment, but multiple sources familiar with their thinking have poured cold water on bid speculation.Catz declined to comment on whether Oracle had made an approach to buy Salesforce.com, following a report on Wednesday that Salesforce.com had hired advisers after receiving an offer from an unnamed suitor.If Microsoft or another rival did buy Salesforce.com, it might help Oracle in the customer relationship management sector, Catz said.""It would cause a lot of disruption in that market and so I would view that as something that would be helpful to us especially in the short or medium term, dependent on who it was."" Catz was speaking at a media event at Oracle's headquarters in Silicon Valley on Thursday. Catz and her colleague Mark Hurd were both named CEO of Oracle in September, as co-founder and former CEO Larry Ellison took the titles of executive chairman and chief technology officer. Oracle has spent more than $60 billion on more than 100 acquisitions in its 38-year history but is ""not known to throw around money,"" Catz said.The $190 billion market value company, which built its fortune on database systems and corporate software, is much bigger than Salesforce.com, which is worth about $46 billion. But it lags Salesforce.com in the fast-growing market for online customer relationship management (CRM), helping corporations organize and track sales calls and leads. Salesforce.com is No. 1 in the $23 billion a year CRM market, according to tech research firm Gartner, on track for about $6.5 billion in annual revenue this fiscal year. Salesforce.com is entirely provided over the cloud with no software directly installed on PCs. Oracle and Microsoft, which were relatively late to the cloud model, have much smaller online CRM revenues, but do not break them out. Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff has been a vocal critic of Oracle, Microsoft and SAP, goading them for their slow adoption of the cloud, which has divided opinion over the viability of an acquisition.

603,"  (Adds background on Oracle, Microsoft)By Bill RigbyREDWOOD CITY, Calif., April 30 Oracle Corp  Chief Executive Safra Catz said her company could benefit if Microsoft Corp or another rival bought online customer relationship management firm Salesforce.com Inc .Oracle, Microsoft and Germany's SAP are the most likely candidates for such a big deal, according to analysts, which could top $50 billion and be the biggest software acquisition on record.Each of the companies have declined to comment, but multiple sources familiar with their thinking have poured cold water on bid speculation.Catz declined to comment on whether Oracle had made an approach to buy Salesforce.com, following a report on Wednesday that Salesforce.com had hired advisers after receiving an offer from an unnamed suitor. If Microsoft or another rival did buy Salesforce.com, it might help Oracle in the customer relationship management sector, Catz said.""It would cause a lot of disruption in that market and so I would view that as something that would be helpful to us especially in the short or medium term, dependent on who it was.""Catz was speaking at a media event at Oracle's headquarters in Silicon Valley on Thursday. Catz and her colleague Mark Hurd were both named CEO of Oracle in September, as co-founder and former CEO Larry Ellison took the titles of executive chairman and chief technology officer. Oracle has spent more than $60 billion on more than 100 acquisitions in its 38-year history but is ""not known to throw around money,"" Catz said.The $190 billion market value company, which built its fortune on database systems and corporate software, is much bigger than Salesforce.com, which is worth about $46 billion. But it lags Salesforce.com in the fast-growing market for online customer relationship management (CRM), helping corporations organize and track sales calls and leads. Salesforce.com is No. 1 in the $23 billion a year CRM market, according to tech research firm Gartner, on track for about $6.5 billion in annual revenue this fiscal year.Salesforce.com is entirely provided over the cloud with no software directly installed on PCs. Oracle and Microsoft, which were relatively late to the cloud model, have much smaller online CRM revenues, but do not break them out.Salesforce.com CEO Marc Benioff has been a vocal critic of Oracle, Microsoft and SAP, goading them for their slow adoption of the cloud, which has divided opinion over the viability of an acquisition.""Personality is not a factor,"" said Michael Maoz, an analyst at Gartner.

612,"   By Richard Leong | NEW YORK  NEW YORK The global bond market rout slowed on Thursday as long-term borrowing costs retreated from their highest levels in more than five months, helping to stabilize European stocks and kindle a mild recovery on Wall Street.The absence of a deal between Greece and its lenders, however, put pressure on the euro and regional stocks.Investors' rush out of stocks and bonds earlier this week sent major European indexes to their lowest in two months and major U.S. and Japanese gauges to the weakest in a month.U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's warning about high equity valuations on Wednesday added pressure to U.S. stocks ahead of Friday's U.S. jobs report, which may support expectations of a possible Fed rate increase later this year.Oil prices scaled back from 2015 highs on the perception of ample supply despite data that showed the first weekly drop in U.S. crude inventories since January.""That drastic, draconian move in bonds and violent updraft in oil are settling a little bit and that's helping us focus on stocks,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.A retreat in European bond yields from their session peaks caused the euro to decline from a 10-week high against the dollar. A bounce in the dollar and elevated bond yields touched off a second day of selling in gold. Bond markets were at the center of this week's rout, prompted by heavy supply and less pessimism about Europe, with German Bunds on track for their biggest weekly spike in yields in over a decade.Italian and Spanish yields hit 2 percent for the first time this year, French yields topped 1 percent and U.S. Treasuries, the benchmark for borrowing costs globally, briefly broke 2.3 percent. [EUR/GVD] [US/]Global yields receded from their Thursday peaks on bargain-hunting, led by Japanese investors who had been out of the market due to the three-day Golden Week holiday, analysts and traders said.  The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 83.38 points, or 0.47 percent, at 17,925.36, the S&P 500 ended 7.9 points, or 0.38 percent, higher at 2,088.05 and the Nasdaq Composite finished up 25.90 points, or 0.53 percent, to 4,945.54.

619,"   By Nadia Damouni  Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) currently is not weighing an offer for Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N), two people familiar with the matter said on Thursday, dampening speculation that Microsoft could be drawn into bidding for the cloud software company.Bloomberg News, citing people with knowledge of the matter, reported earlier this week that Microsoft was evaluating a bid for Salesforce after the latter was approached by another unnamed would-be buyer.Microsoft considers Salesforce's current market valuation  expensive, one of the people said. It is possible that Microsoft could review a bid for Salesforce in the long term, the other person said.The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.Microsoft and Salesforce both declined to comment. San Francisco-based Salesforce is No. 1 in the $23 billion-a-year customer relationship management (CRM) market, according to tech research firm Gartner. It helps corporations organize and track sales calls and leads.Salesforce's services are entirely provided over the cloud, with no software directly installed on PCs. Oracle (ORCL.N) and Microsoft, which were relatively late to the cloud model, have much smaller online CRM revenues.As a result, Microsoft and several other big software companies are seeking to beef up their presence in cloud computing. Yet any deal for Salesforce, which has a market capitalization of $49 billion, would be pricey. Salesforce's shares, which have risen 48 percent in the last 12 months, trade at 106.8 times the company's forward earnings, well above Microsoft's multiple of 19.1, according to Thomson Reuters data.Last month, Oracle Chief Executive Safra Catz said her company could benefit if Microsoft or another rival bought Salesforce.com. ""It would cause a lot of disruption in that market and so I would view that as something that would be helpful to us, especially in the short or medium term, dependent on who it was,"" Catz said. She declined to comment on whether Oracle had made an approach to buy Salesforce.Another potential buyer for Salesforce has ruled itself out. SAP SE (SAPG.DE) Chief Executive Bill McDermott said earlier this week his company has ""zero interest"" in its software rival. ""We have never bought something that was impaired and in decline,"" he said, saying that Salesforce's cloud computing software was becoming commoditized.

The central bank's officials believed it would be premature to raise rates next month even though most felt the economy was set to rebound from a dismal start to the year, according to minutes from their April policy meeting.However, data on Thursday showed that jobless claims rose slightly more than expected last week, manufacturing sector growth slowed for a second straight month during May and home resales unexpectedly fell in April.""I doubt we'll see a rate hike this year,"" said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management in Chicago.""The market is weighed down by debt.

Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)       WEEK AHEAD      The stragglers for the earnings season - Home Depot, Wal-Mart and a few others - will report results to close out the quarter next week, with expectations that retailers would see decent sales after recent revisions show better-than-expected activity in the second quarter. The markets will also continue to watch the Chinese yuan after its unexpected devaluation this week, with anticipation that the dollar will strengthen a bit more, boosting bond-market activity in what is otherwise expected to be a slower week.      Fed minutes are released on Wednesday and will be parsed for clues of an interest rate rise. The Changes in the July statement pointed to an improving economy and labor markets. Characterization of the debate in the minutes could indicate how firm opinions are about the state of the U.S., and how confident members are that inflation and employment will move towards the Fed's target levels. Investors will also look for the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 0.2 percent in July, a bit down from a rise of 0.3 percent in June. Housing data, including housing starts and building permits on Tuesday and existing home sales on Thursday will be in focus. The Conference Board releases its Leading Economic Index, a gauge of future U.S. economic activity on Thursday.      Retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Target Corp release its results for the second quarter. Wal-Mart is expected to report better-than-expected quarterly sales on Tuesday, while Target is expected to miss estimates when it reports on Wednesday. Also on Tuesday, TJX Cos Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' average estimates. The off-price retailer is expected to be helped by lower gas prices, wage growth, and higher traffic to its stores as more consumers hunt for bargains. A hike in the number and quality of brands in its stores and merchandise that reflects popular fashion trends is also expected to drive sales. Investors will look for third-quarter forecast, commentary on industry trends and plans to expand in international markets.      Home Depot Inc, the world's No. 1 home improvement chain, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts' average estimate on Tuesday. Strong housing market data over the last few months is expected to have kept overall demand for home improvement goods steady. However, record rainfall in May and June in large parts of the United States is likely to have kept a lid on sales of products in the home exterior improvement categories, such as paint and gardening supplies. Lowe's Companies Inc, the second-largest U.S. home improvement chain, is likely to report second-quarter sales below analysts' average estimates on Wednesday.      Hardware and software maker Hewlett-Packard Co is expected to report third-quarter earnings slightly above analysts' average estimate on Thursday. HP has been cutting costs and focusing on higher-margin sales in the face of a strong dollar and weak enterprise demand for its services. The company is also in the processes of separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing corporate hardware and service operations.      Salesforce.com Inc, the world's biggest maker of online sales software, is expected to report a second-quarter profit above analysts' average estimate. Salesforce has struggled to earn consistent profits despite strong revenue growth over the past few years, hurt by higher spending on hiring. The company reported a profit for the first time in seven quarters in May. On Thursday, the investors will look for improvement in margins in the quarter and merger-related comments.      Data storage equipment maker NetApp Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue on Wednesday slightly above average analysts' estimate. NetApp, which cut about 500 jobs in May, has been trying to boost growth by focusing on cloud-based products as businesses cut spending on high-end storage systems. The company appointed George Kurian as its new CEO in June to replace Tom Georgens. Investors would be looking for second-quarter forecast.      On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis President Narayana Kocherlakota speaks before the ""Macroeconomic Policy and Price Measurement Issues in a Low Inflation Environment"" conference, in Seoul, South Korea. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco releases the text of the speech Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams delivered before the Bank Indonesia-BIS Research Conference in Jakarta, Indonesia.      Apparel retailer Gap Inc is expected to report a second-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday. Out of fashion merchandise and a general lack of trendy products have led to a decline in sales at the company's flagship Gap brand, leading to heavy discounts. Shipment delays caused due to disruptions at the West Coast ports early this year and a strong dollar are also expected to hurt the company's results in the quarter. Investors will look for comments on recovery at the Gap brand and performance in the current quarter.      On Wednesday, teen apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales above analysts' average estimates. The earnings beat is expected to be driven by trendy, fashionable merchandise, lower discounts, benefits from lower cotton prices and tight inventory controls. American Eagle is also benefiting from a new multi-channel distribution center that allows it to control inventories more efficiently by enabling it to supply to its brick-and-mortar as well as online stores. Investors will look for third-quarter forecast, commentary on promotions and trends, and expectations for the back-to-school shopping season.      Agriculture equipment maker Deere & Co has been hurt by a strong dollar as well as weak demand for its farm and turf equipment, which make up about two-thirds of its annual revenue. Falling U.S. farm income and weak commodity prices have reduced spending on new equipment by farmers. In May, Deere forecast a fall in global sales for its farm equipment in 2015 and said it would close plants and cut jobs. When the company reports its third-quarter results on Friday, the investors will be looking for an update on the company's plans to shutter more factories to adjust to lower demand, as well as whether it is expected to take a hefty charge on a tractor recall announced earlier in August. They will also be looking for more information on a fire in a chemical warehouse in China last week that left some Deere workers critically injured.      Friday data is expected to show that Canada's June retail sales have increased a little, compared with the previous month's reading. It is likely to have risen 0.2 percent, compared with a rise of 1.0 percent in May. Canada's inflation data is also out on Friday. Country's annual inflation is likely to have advanced 1.4 percent in July, up from 1.0 percent in June. Statistics Canada releases June wholesale trade data on Thursday.      On Thursday, Mexico's statistics institute will release GDP data for the second quarter, after the central bank said it sees quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.3 percent for the period, slackening from the first quarter after weaker-than-expected exports and a slump in domestic oil output. The same day, data with show how economic activity fared in June, after slowing to a nine-month low in May. On Friday, retail sales data for June will show how domestic spending performed after rebounding by 0.2 percent in May.           MONDAY, AUGUST 17      U.S. homebuilder sentiment is expected to stay strong in August as the National Association of Home Builders's NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index is likely to show an increase to 61 from 60 in July, which was the highest since November 2005. (1000/1400) Also, the New York Federal Reserve releases its New York Fed's Empire State general business conditions index for August. (0830/1230)      Beauty products company Estee Lauder Co Inc has been seeing a revival in sales in North America, helped by product launches and acquisitions. However, Estee has to increase promotions in its flagship Clinique and Estee Lauder brands which have shown some weakness. The company's smaller brands such as Smashbox and Bobbi Brown have seen a rise in demand, helped by their extensive online presence. Even as sales in overseas markets like the UK and China grow by double digit percentages, a stronger dollar in the past few quarters has stripped their value. The company is expected to beat revenue and profit estimates for the fourth quarter. Investors will be keen on 2016 forecast, updates on acquisitions and the impact of the dollar.      Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc is expected to report second-quarter profit and sales slightly above analysts' average estimates. The beat is expected to be driven by strong performance at the flagship Urban Outfitters brand, which accounts for a majority of sales, but margins are expected to be pressured by higher promotions at the Anthropologie brand, where sales growth has slowed in recent quarters. The company is also benefiting from investments in its fast-growing e-commerce and online division. Investors will look for commentary on sales recovery at the Anthropologie brand, promotions, and updates on performance for the back-to-school shopping season.      Data from Statistics Canada will show the holdings of Canadian securities by non-residents for June. Foreign investors sold C$5.45 billion in Canadian assets in May.

640,"  (Adds details on currency, emerging markets revenue)By Lehar Maan and Abhirup RoyOct 19 International Business Machines Corp  posted a bigger-than-expected drop in revenue and cut its full-year profit forecast, as a stronger U.S. dollar accentuated weakness in demand from China and emerging markets.It was the 14th quarter in a row that IBM has posted a reduction in revenue, as the world's largest technology services company gets rid of low-margin businesses, but has so far failed to make up the shortfall with newer initiatives in the more lucrative area of cloud computing.Shares of IBM fell 4.8 percent in after-hours trading to $141.95.""This is another example of the massive headwinds that large-cap traditional tech stalwarts are seeing in this ever-changing environment, as more customers move to the cloud,"" FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.China was particularly hard hit, with fewer big deals causing revenue from that country to fall 17 percent, IBM's chief financial officer said on a conference call with analysts. Sales in Brazil, Russia, India and China combined were down 30 percent.Armonk, New York-based IBM, which gets more than half its business from overseas, said overall revenue from continuing operations was cut 9 percent by a strong U.S. dollar, which is up about 17 percent from a year ago against a basket of currencies.The company's total revenue fell 13.9 percent to $19.28 billion in the quarter, below analysts' average forecast of $19.62 billion. Martin Schroeter, IBM's CFO, pointed to weakness in its consulting and storage businesses for the revenue shortfall, after taking currency moves and discontinued business into account.'STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES' ""I would characterize it as the consulting and systems integration business moving away from these large, packaged applications and the storage business moving to flash and to the cloud,"" Schroeter told Reuters in an interview. Flash is a speedy type of memory used in mobile phones and other types of electronic devices.IBM lowered its full-year 2015 operating profit forecast to a range of $14.75 to $15.75 per share from $15.75 to $16.50. Analysts on average were expecting $15.68, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company is shifting away from hardware to the cloud, much like established rivals such as Oracle Corp and Microsoft Corp. Each is striving to boost Internet-based software and services sales to compete with Salesforce.com Inc and Amazon.com Inc's web software unit.In August, IBM said it would buy medical image company Merge Healthcare Inc in a $1-billion deal and combine it with its newly formed health analytics unit, which is powered by its famous Watson supercomputer. Revenue from what the company calls ""strategic imperatives,"" which include cloud and mobile computing, data analytics, social and security software, rose about 17 percent in the third quarter ended Sept 30.Yet the new businesses have so far failed to make up for revenue lost to divestitures. The company known as 'Big Blue' has been selling low-margin businesses such as cash registers, low-end servers and semiconductors to focus on high-growth areas such as security software and data analytics, besides cloud-based services.IBM's net income from continuing operations fell to $2.96 billion, or $3.02 per share, from $3.46 billion, or $3.46 per share, a year earlier.Consolidated net income rose to $2.95 billion, or $3.01 per share, from $18 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier.Last year profit was hurt by non recurring pre-tax charge of $3.3 billion, net of tax, for discontinued operations.Excluding items, IBM earned $3.34 per share from continuing operations in the latest quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of a profit of $3.30 per share.Up to Monday's close, IBM's shares had fallen about 7 percent this year.

Deferred revenue, which primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance from subscription services, rose 26 percent to $3.82 billion in the second quarter. Jefferies analysts had estimated deferred revenue of $3.89 billion.""The revenue in the quarter isn't the best indicator of how the quarter went, especially for a SaaS (software as a service) company like this one,"" Wedbush Securities analyst Steve Koenig said. Billings, a more important metric, was below estimate and consensus, Koenig said.Revenue from the company's biggest unit, the sales cloud business which involves software that allows companies to forecast sales opportunities, rose 12.5 percent to $754.9 million, for the second quarter. Salesforce reported net income of $229.6 million, or 33 cents per share, in the second quarter ended July 31, compared with a loss of $852,000, or nil cents per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose 25 percent to $2.04 billion.Excluding items, the company earned 24 cents per share. Analysts had expected earnings of 22 cents per share on revenue of $2.02 billion.

BakerSAN FRANCISCO, Sept 27 With speculation mounting that Twitter Inc will soon have a new corporate owner, the 10-year-old social networking service - which has long struggled to define its core purpose -may end up heading in one of several distinctly different directions depending on who ends up paying for it.Companies including Salesforce.com Inc, Walt Disney Co and Alphabet Inc's Google have shown interest in Twitter, which is working with investment banks to evaluate its options, according to people familiar with the matter.With Salesforce.com, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming.It is not clear how quickly Twitter might approach a sale, but it is moving to formalize the process, sources have said.

Salesforce.com could also likely gain much of the benefit of Twitter's data from licensing its trove of tweets as opposed to buying the whole company.Salesforce.com investors are already spooked by the speculation it could acquire Twitter: its shares are down 6  percent since news of the company's interest flared up last week.

695,"   By Liana B. Baker and Jessica Toonkel  Twitter Inc has told potential acquirers it is seeking to conclude negotiations about selling itself by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, according to people familiar with the matter.The timeline is hugely ambitious in the context of most mergers and acquisitions, given that Twitter began mulling a sale only last month. It is the clearest sign yet that Chief Executive Jack Dorsey is pushing to provide clarity to shareholders and employees over the company's future as quickly as possible.Binding acquisition offers are due in the next two weeks, and Twitter has already whittled down the field of potential acquirers, the people said this week. Salesforce.com Inc is in the running, while Google parent Alphabet Inc, and Walt Disney Co have also been contemplating bids, the people added.Recode reported on Wednesday, citing sources it did not identify, that Google would not move forward with a bid to acquire Twitter.It is not certain the process will result in a sale, the Reuters sources cautioned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.    Twitter and Salesforce declined to comment. Disney and Google did not return requests for comment.With Salesforce.com, Twitter might turn its focus to customer service communications and mining its database of tweets for business intelligence. Google would likely be most interested in the social and news dimensions of Twitter. Disney, by contrast, might see it as a way to expand the reach of its sports and entertainment programming. Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news. The company missed Wall Street's sales expectations in both the first and second quarters of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company.It has also failed to keep pace with rivals, notably Facebook Inc's Instagram and Snapchat.

699,"   By Caroline Valetkevitch  U.S. stocks ended little changed on Friday, losing ground late after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's comments on the economy unnerved investors.Financial shares finished up, giving the S&P 500 its biggest boost after stronger-than-expected bank results, but gave up most of their early gains. Healthcare shares led declines.Yellen, in a speech at a conference of policymakers and academics, laid out the deepening concern at the Fed that U.S. economic potential is slipping - and may need aggressive steps to rebuild it.""In looking at the market, I think, yes, (Yellen's speech) had a dovish tilt to it if you took it literally,"" said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive of DoubleLine Capital, said Yellen's speech could suggest the U.S. central bank will stay accommodative for longer.Yellen did not address interest rates or immediate policy concerns directly. Traders have currently priced in a 67-percent chance of a rate hike in December.The S&P 500 financial index .SPSY was up 0.5 percent. JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) and Citigroup (C.N) trounced third-quarter estimates. Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N) barely beat expectations as a sales scandal engulfed the bank.  Shares of JPMorgan ended down 0.3 percent, however, while Citigroup (C.N) ended up 0.3 percent and Wells Fargo (WFC.N) was down 0.1 percent.Wells Fargo has been under pressure following recent revelations that branch staff had opened as many as 2 million accounts without customers' knowledge. The bank earnings somewhat helped shore up Wall Street's confidence on the outlook for third-quarter earnings after some disappointing results from industrial and healthcare companies. S&P 500 earnings for the quarter are still expected to have declined 0.4 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed up 39.44 points, or 0.22 percent, to 18,138.38, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.43 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,132.98 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.83 points, or 0.02 percent, to 5,214.16.For the week, the Dow was down 0.6 percent, the S&P 500 was down 1 percent and the Nasdaq fell 1.5 percent.Shares of Twitter (TWTR.N) fell 5.1 percent to $16.88 after Salesforce.com's (CRM.N) chief executive ruled out bidding for Twitter. Salesforce.com shares jumped 5.2 percent to $74.27.HP Inc (HPQ.N) fell 4.4 percent to $14.48 after the company said it would cut about 3,000 to 4,000 jobs over the next three years. About 6.0 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.6 billion daily average for the past 20 trading days, according to Thomson Reuters data.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 27 new highs and 80 new lows.

Yellen, in a speech at a conference of policymakers and top academics, laid out the deepening concern at the Fed that U.S. economic potential is slipping - and may need aggressive steps to rebuild it.Traders have currently priced in a 67-percent chance of a rate hike in December, while the odds for November are minimal as the Fed's meeting falls just days before the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election.""Is Chair Yellen now adding yet another reason for holding off raising rates in December? We'll have to watch the data as (we) move towards the mid-December FOMC meeting and more carefully monitor ... Yellen's guidance,"" said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial. Gains in bank shares helped to support the market, with the S&P 500 financial index up 0.8 percent, though shares of JPMorgan, Citigroup and Wells Fargo were mostly flat following their results.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 95.79 points, or 0.53 percent, to 18,194.73, the S&P 500 gained 6.85 points, or 0.32 percent, to 2,139.4 and the Nasdaq Composite  added 11.72 points, or 0.22 percent, to 5,225.05.

721,"  By Ernest Scheyder and Swetha GopinathJan 17 Schlumberger Ltd, the world's largest oilfield services company, posted a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Friday as robust international activity offset stiff competition in North America.Fracking, drilling seismic studies and other lucrative services for oil producers across most of the Middle East, Asia and Latin America helped the company's profit top analysts' estimates for the ninth straight quarter.Intense competition with Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc for work in North America's vast shale fields, though, combined with weak natural gas prices, eroded regional results.Without strong sales from the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, North American revenue would have dipped.""The main challenge in the North America land market is still pricing,"" Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a conference call with investors.Negotiations for new contracts with several key North American customers should further dent results, with pricing falling, he said. Statoil and other international energy firms are Schlumberger's largest North American customers and have used the oversupply of oilfield services to their advantage.Despite tepid North American growth, Schlumberger expects the global economy to improve in 2014 and oil demand to rise, with double-digit earnings growth across the company for the year, Kibsgaard said.Schlumberger has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers. International markets brought in about two-thirds of Schlumberger's 2013 revenue of $45.27 billion. Middle Eastern revenue jumped 5 percent in the quarter, helped by activity in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but a temporary shutdown of operations in southern Iraq in November, following a protest, slightly dented fourth-quarter results, the company said.Schlumberger suspended activity in Iraq in November after dozens of Shi'ite Muslim workers and tribesmen, accusing a foreign security adviser of insulting their religion, stormed the Schlumberger camp in North Rumaila and wrecked offices.Seasonal slowdowns in North America, the North Sea, Russia and China also weighed on results. The company expects oil producers' exploration and production spending, the lion's share of its business, to increase this year for international markets and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.Barclays expects oil and gas companies to spend about $723 billion on exploration and production this year, an increase of 6.1 percent from 2013, according to report released last month.Schlumberger's net income rose to $1.66 billion, or $1.26 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec.31, from $1.36 billion, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier.Excluding items, profit from continuing operations was $1.35 per share.Revenue rose about 7 percent to $11.91 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.32 per share on revenue of $12.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The results come the day after Schlumberger boosted its quarterly dividend by 28 percent to 40 cents.The company, which reviews its dividend every January, has no set level for future dividend payouts, Kibsgaard said.""There is no target number,"" he said.Baker Hughes and Halliburton are scheduled to report their fourth-quarter results on Jan. 21.Baker Hughes, considered the smallest of the ""big three"" oil service providers, earlier this month estimated a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit, citing the suspension of its operations in Iraq.Schlumberger shares rose 1.1 percent to $89.61 in morning trading on Friday.Schlumberger shares have risen 21 percent in the past year, compared with a 17 percent rise in the Philadelphia oil service index.",2014-01-17,SLB,"Fri Jan 17, 2014 | 10:38am EST","UPDATE 3-Schlumberger profit surges, helped by Middle East & Asia",http://www.reuters.com//article/schlumberger-results-idUSL3N0KR3DL20140117?type=companyNews,0.9836,0.043,0.849,0.108

724,"  By Guillermo Parra-Bernal     SAO PAULO, Jan 24 Bankrupt oil producer Óleo e Gás Participações SA will delay presenting its restructuring plan to creditors, initially scheduled for Friday, by about a week as the company attempts to secure more funding, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.     Óleo e Gás, formerly known as OGX Petróleo e Gas Participações SA, and creditors are discussing terms of a potential $200 million debtor-in-possession loan, said the sources, who declined to be identified because the talks are private. The delay is unlikely to disrupt operations, and the company has enough funds to stay afloat, both sources added.     Management wants to convince the maximum number of creditors to back the recovery plan, which has to be filed with a Brazilian bankruptcy court, the first source said. Óleo e Gás owes about $5.1 billion to investors such as bond fund Pimco, dozens of suppliers including Schlumberger NV, and sister company and shipbuilder OSX Brasil SA.     Óleo e Gás and OSX are both controlled by Brazilian tycoon Eike Batista, the former billionaire whose empire of commodities and industrial companies collapsed last year in dramatic fashion under a mountain of debt after disappointing output at the oil company's wells sent investors running for the exits.     Calls to Óleo e Gás in Rio de Janeiro were not immediately answered. Lawyers working on behalf of the company and creditors declined to comment.     Once Óleo e Gás delivers the restructuring plan to the bankruptcy court, creditors will then have between 30 days and 60 days to endorse or reject the plan. Bankers and creditors have moved slowly with the DIP loan because they are uneasy with the lack of precedent for such a structure in Brazil, the second source said.     In the United States, DIP loans are the first debt that gets repaid. As a result, such loans tend to be a regular feature of bankruptcy cases and are credited with saving companies and their employees from fire-sale liquidations.      In recent weeks, Óleo e Gás obtained a bridge loan to pay for operations while it seeks the DIP loan.      The company, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Oct. 30, stands to lose offshore exploration rights in Brazil's Espírito Santo state should it fail to meet capital spending commitments by the end of this week, a source with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters on Thursday.

At the same time, they are moving into newer, more-lucrative Eastern Hemisphere regions that have higher logistical risks.Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, which provide drilling technology and equipment, well construction services and seismic surveys for oil and natural gas companies, have for months been complaining of market weakness in North America.Additionally, Royal Dutch Shell and other large, international oil companies, after a decade of double-digit growth in capital budgets, have begun cutting spending as oil prices stagnate and project costs rise, a bad sign for oilfield service companies.Executives from Schlumberger, the world's No. 1 oilfield services company by revenue, and Baker Hughes told analysts on conference calls they expect results to slightly improve this year in parts of North America but they warned of potential problems in other regions.Schlumberger said deepwater drilling off Brazil should decline 20 percent this year compared with last year and that revenue could drop in Russia due to weakness in the rouble. Both countries are important markets for Schlumberger.""Brazil revenue for us this year is going to be significantly down versus 2013,"" Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said on a call with analysts, citing slipping demand and less-lucrative contracts signed last year.Baker Hughes said its revenue this quarter would decline slightly in North America, where it gets half its annual revenue, partly due to a slowdown in Canada. GULF OF MEXICO HOLDS PROMISE Three years after the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history, large oil and gas companies are ramping up operations in the Gulf of Mexico, which they expect to yield more than 700,000 barrels per day of crude.""The Gulf of Mexico will play a big role in our North American margin growth,"" Baker Hughes Chief Executive Officer Martin Craighead said.While Schlumberger's revenue from deepwater drilling in the region fell in the first quarter due to operational delays, it  expects the situation to normalize this quarter. ""The outlook for deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico remains strong for the full year,"" Kibsgaard said.Baker Hughes, which said it had a good first quarter in the Gulf, expects business in the region to continue to improve and boost margins particularly in the second half of the year.The company's North American revenue rose 12 percent to $3.68 billion in the first quarter. Baker Hughes posted a 7 percent rise in revenue to $2.78 billion from the region.Baker Hughes' shares rose 4.1 percent to $69.05 in afternoon trading.Schlumberger's shares, which hit their highest point in nearly six years on Thursday morning, fell 0.4 percent to $100.53. The stock has risen about 12 percent in the past month, outperforming shares of Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes.In the past few quarters, unusually cold weather in North America and Russia disrupted drilling, hurting oil and gas companies while pushing up natural gas prices in North America and depleted stockpiles to their lowest level since 2003. Kibsgaard said the fundamentals of the global economic recovery were intact despite the harsh winter, slowing growth in China, and problems in Ukraine.Schlumberger, which cut its 2014 capital spending budget by about 3 percent to $3.8 billion, said it expected spending on well-related activity to rise by more than 6 percent this year.WEAK LATAM Schlumberger's first-quarter revenue fell short of analysts' average estimate due to reduced drilling activity and pricing pressure in Latin America.Revenue from the region declined 8 percent to $1.76 billion, the lowest in eight quarters. Latin America accounted for nearly 16 percent of Schlumberger's total sales in the first quarter ended March 31.Schlumberger's profit from continuing operations rose 32.5 percent to $1.59 billion, or $1.21 per share, in the first quarter.

730,"   By Sayantani Ghosh and Ashutosh Pandey  Oilfield services companies Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) reported better-than-expected quarterly profits and signaled an improvement in the North American market, driven by increased drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.Schlumberger, the world's largest oilfield services company, gets a third of its revenue from North America. The region accounts for half of rival Baker Hughes' annual revenue.The companies provide drilling technology and equipment, well construction services and seismic surveys to oil and gas companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N).Three years after the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history, large oil and gas companies are ramping up operations in the Gulf, which is poised to deliver more than 700,000 barrels per day of crude.While Schlumberger's revenue from deepwater drilling in the region fell in the first quarter due to operational delays, the company expects the situation to normalize in the current quarter.""The outlook for deepwater drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico remains strong for the full year,"" Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a conference call with analysts.Baker Hughes, which said it had a good first quarter in the Gulf, expects business to continue to improve in the region and boost margins, particularly in the second half of the year.Barclays analysts were upbeat on both stocks, saying the companies had done well in North America despite a colder-than-usual winter.""The industry bellwether posted a solid earnings number in a tough quarter (and) signaled a 'robust' North American market ...,"" they said in a research note, referring to Schlumberger.The company's North American revenue rose 12 percent to $3.68 billion in the first quarter. Baker Hughes posted a 7 percent rise in revenue to $2.78 billion from the region. Baker Hughes' shares rose as much as 5 percent to $69.43 on the New York Stock Exchange - their highest since August 2011.Schlumberger's shares, which rose less than 1 percent in morning trade to their highest in nearly six years, were marginally down at $100.34 in morning trading.The stock has risen about 12 percent in the past month, outperforming shares of Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes.SPENDING CUTS In the past couple of quarters, colder-than-usual weather in North America and Russia disrupted drilling, hurting oil and gas companies. The cold weather, however, pushed up natural gas prices in North America and depleted stockpiles to their lowest level since 2003, after years of glut that forced many drillers to idle rigs.Kibsgaard said the fundamentals of the global economic recovery were intact despite the harsh winter, slowing growth in China, and problems in Ukraine.""These factors, however, are likely temporary in nature ... but supply and demand is expected to normalize over the coming months,"" he said in a statement.Oilfield services companies are expected to feel the heat as large oil companies, after a decade of double-digit growth, cut spending amid stagnating oil prices and higher project costs.The company has already seen a reduction in spending from integrated oil companies, Kibsgaard said, adding that he expects them to cut spending more on infrastructure and less on well-related projects.

734,"  (The writer is a Reuters columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)By John WasikCHICAGO, June 23 Despite the incendiary conflict in Iraq that last week sent the benchmark price of Brent crude oil to more than $115 a barrel, a nine-month high, U.S. stock markets largely shrugged off the oil threat, hitting record closing highs last week.For investors, a new energy crisis in the Middle East presents something of an opportunity, albeit a fragile, short-term one.Energy production has become much more geographically diverse, particularly in the United States. That lessens the severity of a Mideast production shortfall while boosting the long-term prospects of investment in fossil-fuel companies.As is the case during any threat to global oil production - Iraq is still OPEC's second-largest producer - the share prices of oil companies and the funds that invest in them soar on bad news, which is what happened last week. Petroleum producers score in the short term when this happens.Owing to greater demand for oil and geopolitical tensions, ExxonMobil Corp, the largest energy company by market valuation, climbed 10.5 percent over the three months through June 20, compared to a 5.3 percent gain in the S&P 500 Index. BP PLC (the ADR) was up nearly 15 percent over the three months ended June 20.The last three months are important because they include a spate of good reports on economic growth in Europe and the U.S. and a run-up to the political strife in the Middle East. These events, and growing demand from developing countries such as China and India, have pressured oil prices upward. The Vanguard Energy ETF, which holds a broad portfolio of oil and gas exploration, refining and pipeline companies, gained 16 percent in the quarter through June 20. It holds companies like ExxonMobil, Chevron Corp and Schlumberger NV, and nearly all its holdings are based in North America. It's up about 16 percent in the three months through June 20.For a fund that's not dominated by the most popular energy stocks, consider the Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Energy ETF , which holds a global portfolio of energy producers in roughly equal proportions.The Guggenheim portfolio places more emphasis on smaller, lesser-known companies like Newfield Exploration Co, Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Nabors Industries Ltd . The fund is up nearly 16 percent for the three months through June 20. Independent companies like these may have more drilling activities in the areas where shale oil and gas are being discovered throughout North America. ENERGY SHOCK BOOMERANG Over a short period of time, it makes sense to hold energy stocks as a defense against rising oil prices. After all, companies make profits on price surges.But on the consumer level, higher petroleum prices can act as a damaging boomerang. When prices soar beyond a certain level, it brakes economic activity across the board. Higher fuel prices force people to drive less and stay away from stores, raise prices for everything from farm goods to plastics, and act as a tax on economic growth.During the last draconian oil-price run-up in 2008 - when crude oil prices topped $140 a barrel - the combination of an energy shock, a banking/credit meltdown and massive unemployment from Athens to San Francisco created a recession in Europe and North America. Towards the end of that year, energy prices bludgeoned an already-hobbled economic situation and the Vanguard Energy fund lost nearly 40 percent of its value, slightly more than the S&P 500 Index.Looking ahead, what may mitigate any traumas in terms of oil prices will be growing U.S. oil and gas production, particularly in regions where ""fracking"" technology has liberated more hydrocarbons from shale formations from the Appalachians to North Dakota.Production in the U.S. was up a record 1.1 million barrels per day last year, offseting declines in global output from Libya, Nigeria and Iraq - all due to political strife.""The huge investments seen in the U.S. have been encouraged and enabled by a favorable policy regime,"" BP economist Christof Ruhl told Reuters. ""And this has resulted in the U.S. delivering the world's largest increase in oil production last year. Indeed, the U.S. increase ... was one of the biggest annual oil production increases the world has ever seen.""Across the globe, the future for energy stocks is positive long term. Consumers in China, India and Africa are buying petroleum-hungry vehicles. And until less-costly alternatives present themselves, fossil fuels will power the engines of these developing economies.Short-term political conflicts are unlikely to extinguish these trends.

735,"  Schlumberger Ltd's, the world's largest oilfield services company, reported better-than-expected second quarter revenue as drilling activity picked up in North America.Revenue from the oversupplied market — where all major oilfield service providers have been competing for fewer contracts — jumped 16 percent to $3.89 billion from a year earlier.Smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc also reported a higher-than-expected profit on strong growth in North America, earlier on Thursday.Schlumberger and Baker Hughes provide several services, including seismic surveys that determine where oil lies under the earth's surface and hydraulic fracturing of wells.Robust drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico and a rise in onshore drilling in the United States helped offset seasonal weakness in Canada, Schlumberger said in a statement on Thursday. Schlumberger has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers, which include Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc.International markets brought in about two-thirds of Schlumberger's quarterly revenue, with a 12 percent rise in revenue from the Middle East and Asia and 4 percent rise in Europe. Revenue from Latin America fell 3 percent. Total revenue for the second quarter ended June 30 rose 8 percent to $12.05 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $11.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income fell by nearly a quarter to about $1.60 billion, or $1.21 per share, from $2.10 billion, or $1.57 per share.

736,"  (Adds details from statement, background)July 17 Schlumberger Ltd's, the world's largest oilfield services company, reported better-than-expected second quarter revenue as drilling activity picked up in North America.Revenue from the oversupplied market - where all major oilfield service providers have been competing for fewer contracts - jumped 16 percent to $3.89 billion from a year earlier.Smaller rival Baker Hughes Inc also reported a higher-than-expected profit on strong growth in North America, earlier on Thursday. Schlumberger and Baker Hughes provide several services, including seismic surveys that determine where oil lies under the earth's surface and hydraulic fracturing of wells.Robust drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico and a rise in onshore drilling in the United States helped offset seasonal weakness in Canada, Schlumberger said in a statement on Thursday. Schlumberger has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers, which include Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc.International markets brought in about two-thirds of Schlumberger's quarterly revenue, with a 12 percent rise in revenue from the Middle East and Asia and 4 percent rise in Europe. Revenue from Latin America fell 3 percent. Total revenue for the second quarter ended June 30 rose 8 percent to $12.05 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $11.94 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net income fell by nearly a quarter to about $1.60 billion, or $1.21 per share, from $2.10 billion, or $1.57 per share.Earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.37, higher than the analyst average estimate of $1.36 per share.

738,"  (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)By John WasikCHICAGO, July 21 All too often, I see investors heading in the wrong direction en masse. They buy stocks at the top of the market or bonds when interest rates are heading up.Occasionally, though, active investors may be heading in the right direction. A case in point has been the flow of money into certain exchange-traded funds in the first half of this year.Reflecting most hot money trends, billions of dollars moved because of headlines. The Energy Select SPDR exchange-traded fund, which I discussed three weeks ago, gathered more than $3 billion in assets in the first half, when crude oil prices climbed and demand for hydrocarbons remained high.The Energy SPDR, which charges 0.16 percent for annual management expenses and holds Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron Corp and Schlumberger NV, has climbed 22 percent in the past 12 months, with nearly one-third of that gain coming in the three months through July 18. Long-term, this may be a solid holding as developing countries such as China and India demand more oil.""We think the Energy Select SPDR is a play of oil prices remaining high and supporting growth for integrated oil & gas and exploration and production companies,"" analysts from S&P Capital IQ said in a recent ""MarketScope Advisor"" newsletter.Headlines also favored European stocks as represented by the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF, which holds leading eurozone stocks such as Nestle SA, Novartis AG  and Roche Holding AG. The fund has been the top asset gatherer thus far this year, with $4 billion in new money, according to S&P Capital IQ.As Europe continues to recover over the next few years and the European Central Bank keeps rates low, global investors will continue to benefit from this growing optimism. The Vanguard fund has gained nearly 16 percent for the 12 months through July 18. It charges 0.09 percent in annual expenses and is a solid holding if you have little or no European exposure in your stock portfolio.RATE HIKES Not all hot money trends make sense, however. As the economy accelerates and interest-rate hikes look increasingly likely, investors are still piling money into bond funds, which lose money under those circumstances. The iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF, which holds middle-maturity U.S. Treasury bonds, continued to rank in the top 10 funds in terms of new money in the first half. The fund, which holds nearly $5 billion, is up nearly 4 percent for the 12 months through July 18, compared with 4.2 percent for the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Total return index, a benchmark for U.S. Treasuries. The fund charges 0.15 percent in annual expenses.While investors were able to squeeze a bit more out of bond returns in the first half of this year, they may be living on borrowed time.The U.S. Federal Reserve confirmed recently that it would be ending purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in October. This stimulus program, known as ""QE2,"" has kept interest rates artificially low as the economy has had a chance to recover.The phasing out of QE2 could be bearish for bond funds. Will interest rates climb to reflect growing demand for credit and possibly higher inflation down the road? How will the ending of the Fed's cheap money program affect U.S. and emerging markets shares?Many pundits believe public corporations may pull back from their enthusiastic stock buybacks and trigger a correction. Yet low inflation and modest employment gains may mute bond market fears.""The Fed is on track to complete tapering in the fourth quarter, and we think there is essentially no chance that it will move the fed funds rate higher this year,"" Bob Doll, chief equity strategist with Nuveen Investments in Chicago, said in a recent newsletter.""With the 10-year Treasury ending the quarter at 2.5 percent, the yield portion of this forecast is more uncertain,"" Doll added, ""although we expect yields will end the year higher than where they began.""While there could be any number of wild cards spoiling the party for stocks, it is wise to ignore short-term trends and prepare for the eventual climb in interest rates.That means staying away from bond funds with long average maturities along with vehicles like preferred stocks and high-yield bonds that are highly sensitive to interest rates.Longer-term, shares of companies in consumer discretionary, materials and information technology businesses likely to benefit from a global economic resurgence will probably be a good bet.Just keep in mind that the hot money can be wrong, so build a long-haul diversified portfolio that protects against the downside of a torrid trend going from hot to cold.

739,"  * Second-quarter revenue up 10 pct, beats expectations* Raises share buyback program to $6 bln from $5 bln* Sees risk from U.S. sanctions on Russia later this year* Sees N. America margins of 20 pct in Q3 vs 18.2 pct in Q2* Shares hit life-high   (Updates link to graphic)By Swetha Gopinath and Ashutosh PandeyJuly 21 Halliburton Co, North America's top oilfield services provider, said it would add fracking equipment and crew to take advantage of higher demand in the region, signaling an industry-wide recovery after a two-year slump.Shares of the world's No.2 oilfield services provider rose 2 percent to a life-high of $72.20 after the company also raised its share repurchase program to $6 billion from $5 billion.Halliburton, like global leader Schlumberger Ltd, said while there was no impact on business yet due to the U.S. sanctions against Russia, projects being tendered later this year could be impacted. The country contributes in the ""low single digit"" percentage to Halliburton's total revenue. ""As tensions potentially escalate and the risk of more sanctions sort of looms, that's what we believe puts some risk into the business in the back half of the year,"" Chief Executive David Lesar said on a post-earnings call.Halliburton reported a 20 percent rise in second-quarter profit, meeting Wall Street's expectations, as drilling activity increased in North America.HIGHER MARGINS Halliburton, which gets half its revenue from North America, said it expects margins in the region to touch 20 percent in the current quarter, up from 18.2 percent in the quarter ended June 30. The company's margin in the region was higher than Baker Hughes Inc's 12 percent and Schlumberger's 18 percent.Halliburton said it would ""immediately"" speed up additions to its crew and hydraulic fracturing fleet as capacity tightened in North America.""I think it is a kind of vote of confidence that demand is on its way back,"" said S&P Capital IQ analyst Stewart Glickman.Prices for hydraulic fracturing, where water, chemicals and sand are blasted into wells to extract oil and gas, have been depressed due to excess equipment and a drop in natural gas drilling, brought on by low prices of the fuel. However, a recent rise in natural gas prices has led to increased drilling, helping boost revenue at Halliburton, Schlumberger and Baker Hughes.WEAK LATAM Halliburton's revenue from North America rose sequentially to 11 percent in the second quarter - stronger than a 9 percent rise in the eastern hemisphere, where it had been making a strong push to combat the weakness in North America.The weakest region was Latin America, where revenue rose just 4 percent, dragged down by reduced activity, a delayed order and costs related to new projects in Mexico.Margins in the region are expected to improve in the second half, with full-year margins in line with those a year earlier.The company's revenue rose 10 percent to $8.05 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $7.88 billion.Halliburton also said it would move the role of president to Chief Operating Officer Jeff Miller from Chief Executive David Lesar, effective Aug. 1.

746,"  * Region supplied 5 percent of French oil needs in 1920s* Very small volumes produced today, but highly profitable* Suspicion surrounding shale gas holds back permitsBy Gilbert ReilhacMerkwiller-Pechelbronn, France, Oct 1 (Reuters) - S ustainably high oil prices have lured small oil explorers back to Alsace, the cradle of the French oil exploration industry that gave birth to corporate giants such as Schlumberger.The activity near the Rhine on the German border does not amount to an oil boom. The region provides 1 percent of French oil production, which is just under 2 percent of European output.Nonetheless, 13 wells are pumping, two exploration permits have recently been granted and more are being reviewed by the French administration.""For us, Alsace was a sleeping beauty,"" said Stephane Touche, whose company Millennium Geo-Venture holds the two recent exploration permits and has applied for five more.Among its advantages, the region's oil reserves are already completely mapped and are very close to the surface. Oil leaks have long provided a favourite mud-bath playground for wild boars in the Alsatian forest.Oil production in Alsace started in the 18th century and peaked in the 1920s, when more than 650 wells and four refineries supplied 5 percent of French oil needs and provided work for 3,000 people around Merkwiller-Pechelbronn, 50 km north of Strasbourg. In that era, the Schlumberger brothers carried out the first electrical well log and created the company.The drop in oil prices and large discoveries in what was then French Sahara led to the end of the region's oil industry in the 1960s.The Rhine valley has produced about 80 million barrels of oil so far, Touche said.Millennium recently drilled its first well near Soufflenheim, and production is expected to start this autumn. The 46-year-old engineer founded the company with investors from Norwegian company Moore Energy, which has applied for more licences in the Paris basin for conventional oil and gas. MORE PROFITABLE THAN IN AFRICA Another advantage for the oil industry is that French taxes are light by comparison with more established oil-producing countries. Crude production in France becomes commercially viable at around $70 a barrel, according to industry figures.""A barrel produced in France is 10 to 20 times more profitable than a barrel produced in Africa,"" said Philippe Labat, who founded a small company called Oelweg and runs a well near Oberlauterbach.The 60-year-old had been a production engineer at Elf, now known as Total, when it tried and failed to revive French oil production in the 1980s.Oelweg, which has applied for three more permits in Alsace, has re-opened a well abandoned by Elf and has added a heater to improve its productivity. The beam pump, surrounded by corn fields, produces 10 barrels per day with only one part-time worker, giving Oelweg a net profit of 163,500 euros ($207,400) in 2012 on revenue of 375,000 euros.Since the closure of the region's Reichstett refinery in 2011, oil from Alsace is send to the Karlsruhe refinery in Germany. ""Thanks to Alsace, France exports crude oil,"" Labat quipped.The French authorities have not made oil exploration any easier in recent years, however. France banned hydraulic fracking in 2011, and fears about shale gas among environmentalists and the public have made even conventional oil drilling suspect.Last year, a request by U.S. firm Hess Corp to explore for shale oil and gas in the Paris basin, France's main production area, was rejected by the government despite assurances it would not use fracking.The fracking technique, which involves pumping water and chemicals underground, was banned under former President Nicolas Sarkozy due to concerns over the environmental impact including possible contamination of groundwater and earthquakes.The ban was upheld by the constitutional court in 2013, after a challenge by another U.S-based company, Schuepbach Energy, which held two permits that were cancelled.French oil lobby UFIP estimates that 112 hydrocarbon permit requests are currently frozen by the French administration, having been withheld sometimes for several years, although a few have been awarded this year.But the debate about oil and gas exploration on French soil shows no sign of abating. Sarkozy, in a policy U-turn, came out in favour of shale gas in his first political rally since his return to French politics this month, while energy minister Segolene Royal confirmed her opposition.Back in Alsace, however, the local population has no qualms about its black gold. ""It's part of our history,"" the mayor of Soufflenheim, Camille Scheydecker, said.

747,"   By Greg Roumeliotis  Oct 8 Schlumberger Ltd, the world's largest oilfield services company, is exploring the sale of its oilfield tools rental unit Thomas Tools, which could be valued at more than $600 million, according to people familiar with the matter.An auction is already underway for Thomas Tools, which has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of around $80 million, the people said this week.Private equity firms keen to buy the unloved divisions of big conglomerates are among those that have shown interest in Thomas Tools, the people said. Boutique investment firm PPHB is advising Schlumberger on the sale process, one of the people added. The sources asked not to be identified because the process is confidential. A Schlumberger representative did not respond to a request for comment while PPHB declined to comment.New Iberia, Louisiana-based Thomas Tools is a provider of oilfield rental tools, such as drill pipes, to energy exploration companies. Founded in 1961 as a downhole tool specialty company, Thomas Tools was taken over by Houston, Texas-based Schlumberger in 2010 as part of its $11 billion acquisition of Smith International Inc.The market for companies that provide rental equipment to the oilfield industry has become increasingly competitive, with low barriers to entry for new participants offering less sophisticated products, and customers unwilling to tie themselves up in long-term contracts. Reuters reported earlier this year that Light Tower Rentals, a privately held peer of Thomas Tools, was exploring a sale that could have valued it at around $700 million.Light Tower Rentals subsequently pulled the sale process for the entire company after it failed to meet its valuation expectations and borrowed $330 million in July to refinance debt and pay a dividend to its owners, private equity firm Clairvest Group Inc and the company's management.One month later, Light Tower Rentals announced it had sold 44.2 percent of the company's equity for $100 million to new investors that included investment firms StepStone and Constitution Capital Partners LLC.

748,"   By Shubhankar Chakravorty  Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world's largest oilfield services company, posted a third-quarter profit that beat estimates for at least the ninth consecutive quarter, helped by strong drilling activity in North America.Schlumberger, which provides drilling technology and equipment, well construction services and seismic surveys for oil and natural gas companies, said revenue from its U.S. operations rose 18 percent to $4.26 billion in the quarter, accounting for a third of total revenue.Revenue from the company's international business rose 5 percent to $8.31 billion, as its resilient Middle East and Asia businesses trumped ""significant headwinds"" in Northern Iraq and sanctions against Russia, Schlumberger said.Schlumberger, which drills with Rosneft (ROSN.MM) on the island of Sakhalin, had warned in August that sanctions against Russia would hurt its third-quarter profit by as much as 3 cents per share. The company has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers, which include Halliburton Co (HAL.N), Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N) and Weatherford International Plc (WFT.N).Baker Hughes reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first time in five quarters earlier on Thursday, as political tensions in Libya and Iraq and a sharp fall in drilling in the Gulf of Mexico hurt margins. Baker Hughes said its clients would reconsider projects if oil prices fell to and remained at $75 per barrel for a few months.Ample supply and weak demand have hit oil prices in recent months. Global benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose to $84.49 a barrel on Thursday, after falling to $83 earlier, off nearly 28 percent from a June high.U.S. crude prices CLc1 also rose to $82.83 a barrel after falling to a two-year low of $80 a barrel. Schlumberger's shares have lost over a fifth of their value in the past three months, mirroring a fall in global oil prices, while Baker Hughes' stock has declined 30 percent.""Weakening oil prices really don't have an impact on services companies' results. Outside of sentiment issues that affect the stock, it doesn't influence the companies,"" Societe Generale analyst Edward Muztafago said.Net income attributable to Houston, Texas-based Schlumberger rose to $1.95 billion, or $1.49 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.72 billion, or $1.29 per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose 9 percent to $12.65 billion.Analysts on average expected earnings of $1.46 per share on revenue of $12.63 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Schlumberger shares closed up 1.6 percent at $90.64 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Revenue from the company's international business rose 5 percent to $8.31 billion, as its resilient Middle East and Asia businesses trumped ""significant headwinds"" in Northern Iraq and sanctions against Russia, Schlumberger said.Schlumberger, which drills with Rosneft on the island of Sakhalin, had warned in August that sanctions against Russia would hurt its third-quarter profit by as much as 3 cents per share. [ID:ID:nL4N0QI44G]The company has the lowest exposure to North America among the big four oilfield service providers, which include Halliburton Co, Baker Hughes Inc and Weatherford International Plc. Baker Hughes reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first time in five quarters earlier on Thursday, as political tensions in Libya and Iraq and a sharp fall in drilling in the Gulf of Mexico hurt margins.Baker Hughes said its clients would reconsider projects if oil prices fell to and remained at $75 per barrel for a few months.Ample supply and weak demand have hit oil prices in recent months. Global benchmark Brent crude futures rose to $84.49 a barrel on Thursday, after falling to $83 earlier, off nearly 28 percent from a June high.U.S. crude prices also rose to $82.83 a barrel after falling to a two-year low of $80 a barrel. Schlumberger's shares have lost over a fifth of their value in the past three months, mirroring a fall in global oil prices, while Baker Hughes' stock has declined 30 percent.""Weakening oil prices really don't have an impact on services companies' results.

751,"   By Swetha Gopinath  Oct 17 Schlumberger Ltd, the world's largest oilfield services company, said oil and gas spending would increase in 2015 as global oil demand is poised to rise, downplaying fears of an investment slowdown due to weak crude prices.Schlumberger shares were up 7 percent at $97.10 in early morning trading.The company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit after markets closed on Thursday, helped by strong drilling activity in North America.Oil prices have slid nearly 20 percent since June due to oversupply, signs of weak demand growth and indications that key oil producers, particularly Saudi Arabia, have limited appetite to intervene in prices.The steep fall has sparked fears that oilfield earnings would be hurt with oil and gas customers reigning in spending. ""The key to the overall oil market is still that the global oil demand is currently set to increase by 1.1 million barrels per day in 2015, which will require growth in exploration and production investments,"" Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said on a post-earnings call on Friday.The International Energy Agency earlier this week cut its 2015 estimate for oil demand growth by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 1.1 million bpd, citing weak global economies.Oil demand was ""largely unchanged"", while supply was relatively ""well balanced,"" Kibsgaard said on the call. ""WTI oil at $80 a barrel for a short time is unlikely to have an impact on growth and margins for the services companies, but $80 oil for more than a month or two certainly will,"" William Blair & Co analysts wrote in a note.They expect the company to ""wait and see"" how $80 WTI would impact producers' spending plans. West Texas Intermediate crude was at about $83 per barrel on Friday, while Brent crude was over $87.Baker Hughes Inc, the world's No.3 oilfield services provider, said on Thursday that drilling activity was unlikely to slow unless crude fell to and remained at $75 for a few months.Still, Schlumberger expects 2014 exploration spending to fall by 4-5 percent from a year ago, largely due to a 20 percent fall in seismic expenditure.Oil and gas companies are spending more on maximizing production from existing wells, than on searching for new reserves as they face increasing investor pressure to raise shareholder returns.Up to Thursday's close, Schlumberger shares had fallen more than 20 percent over the last three months due to the sharp slide in crude prices.

752,"  The proposed merger of oilfield service companies Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc would create a serious challenger to Schlumberger NV in international markets and cement the two companies' dominance in North America.And that is the problem, according to some analysts.""The proposed merger would be dominant in North America, which could spur protracted (antitrust) scrutiny; and likely elicit howls of protest from customers everywhere, potentially requiring concessions to more than one national anti-trust authority,"" analysts at FBR Capital Markets wrote in a note.Baker Hughes disclosed after the market closed on Thursday that it was in preliminary merger talks with its Houston neighbor.But muted market reaction on Friday highlighted the likelihood that any deal would face an uphill regulatory battle.Baker Hughes' shares were up 0.2 percent in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange while Halliburton's were up 1.4 percent. Schlumberger's stock was up 0.4 percent. A combined Halliburton-Baker Hughes would have combined revenue of about $52 billion, based on 2013 results, outstripping Schlumberger's 2013 revenue of $45.3 billion.The merged company's business in North America would also be about double that of Schlumberger, which gets more than two-thirds of its revenue from international operations.Still, the merged entity's market value of about $70 billion would be far less than Schlumberger's $120 billion. Baker Hughes, whose shares were trading at $58.38 at midday, should be able to command a 25 percent premium to its Wednesday close of $50.98 for an enterprise value of $25.46 billion, Evercore ISI analyst James West said in a note.The proposed deal would give Halliburton, the No. 2 oilfield services provider, the leading market share in oilfield services such as directional drilling, coiled tubing and drill-bits, unseating Schlumberger in all three markets, said West. A deal would not be all bad news for Schlumberger, however. Analysts said that by reducing the number of big players in  the industry to two from three, pricing could stabilize.""Schlumberger, Halliburton and Baker Hughes have been in a knife fight the past few years for international and offshore tenders,"" Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co analysts said.""A combined company could help introduce more discipline to these bid processes and ultimately improve returns/profits for the industry.""  (Reporting by Swetha Gopinath in Bangalore; Editing by Ted Kerr)",2014-11-14,SLB,"Fri Nov 14, 2014 | 2:11pm EST",Proposed merger of oilfield firms poses challenge to Schlumberger,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-bakerhughes-halliburton-research-idUSKCN0IY24H20141114?type=companyNews,0.9144,0.028,0.903,0.069

The Houston-based company said capital expenditure, excluding multiclient and project management investments, is expected to be $3 billion for 2015. Capex for 2014 was $4 billion.""In this uncertain environment, we continue to focus on what we can control.."" Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said. Schlumberger, which provides drilling technology and equipment, reported a fourth-quarter profit that beat Wall Street estimates for the tenth straight quarter.Revenue rose 6 percent to $12.64 billion, mainly helped by an 18.5 percent jump in revenue from North America.Net income attributable to the company fell to $302 million, or 23 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.66 billion, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier.On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.50 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.45 per share,  according Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of the company closed at $76.63 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The multi-stage deal announced by the companies on Tuesday will see U.S. group Schlumberger, which has been in a strategic alliance with Eurasia since 2011, offer $22 a share for the near-46 percent stake.Shares in Eurasia, formed about 10 years ago mostly from the drilling assets of Russia's second-largest oil producer Lukoil, jumped 68 percent to $20.45 per global depositary receipt after Tuesday's announcement. The company, shares of which lost about 60 percent of their value last year in the face of the weakening Russian economy and increased competition from the likes of state oil producer Rosneft, intends to go private by delisting from the London stock market before the deal is completed.  The Schlumberger transaction and delisting are both expected to be completed in the first quarter, Eurasia said.In a separate statement, Schlumberger said it has an option to buy the remaining shares in Eurasia during a two-year period commencing three years from the closing of the initial transaction.

Russia is the world's leading oil producer, with output hitting a post-Soviet high at an average of 10.58 million barrels per day last year, but the Western sanctions pose an increasing threat to this key source of the country's revenue.  The oil services sector is ripe for consolidation as it grapples with reduced exploration investment in response to the painful 57 percent slump in global oil prices to around $49 since June and Schlumberger's move would leave it well placed for any upturn in Russia.Along with Halliburton, Schlumberger is one of the largest foreign oilfield services companies operating in Russia.""Eurasia ... joining with Schlumberger ... establishes an exceptionally strong platform for delivering drilling services to Russia's oil and gas industry as future market conditions stabilize,"" said Roderick Peacock, chairman of Xenon Capital Partners, adviser to Eurasia Drilling's core shareholders.

773,"   By Ernest Scheyder | WILLISTON, N.D.  WILLISTON, N.D. Feb 4 Halliburton, Statoil ASA, Hess Corp and other North Dakota energy companies have decided, for now, not to lay off staff in the No. 2 U.S. oil producing state, hoping to be prepared for any prolonged rebound in crude prices.Many oil producers and their contractors are trying to strike a balance between cutting costs and maintaining workforce reserves after a more-than 50 percent drop in oil prices  since last June.The drop has made some oil patch investors anxious that North Dakota could experience a third oil bust after slumps in the 1950s and 1980s. Local business leaders, though, say they're confident the state's economy can abide the slowdown.Indeed, oil prices are nothing if not volatile, up about 19 percent in the past four trading days after plunging for months.Whiting Petroleum Corp, the largest North Dakota oil producer, has no plans to lay off any of its 507 employees in the state, spokesman Eric Hagen said. Oilfield service provider Halliburton has told its roughly 1,500 North Dakota employees that job cuts are not coming, for now. The update came in a letter to staff from Brent Eslinger, senior district manager for Halliburton in Williston, considered capital of North Dakota's oil patch.Halliburton spokeswoman Susie McMichael added that the company ""will continue to monitor the business environment"" and cut costs as needed.Hess Corp, the state's third-largest oil producer and one that uses Halliburton to hydraulically fracture wells, has no plans to cut North Dakota staff. ""We're all about lean efficiencies, but there are no plans for layoffs,"" Hess spokesman John Roper said.Other large North Dakota producers, including Oasis Petroleum Inc and Statoil, have said they have no plans to reduce their workforce. EOG Resources Inc hasn't ""announced any layoffs,"" spokeswoman K Leonard said. To be sure, all energy-related companies in North Dakota's oil patch are hunkering down. Many of the state's oil producers, including Hess and Oasis, have cut 2015 capital budgets. Whiting and EOG release spending plans later this month.While there are nearly 800 wells needing to be fracked in North Dakota, oil producers can wait up to a year to do so. Hess, for instance, plans to bring fewer wells online in 2015.Halliburton's announcement last month that it will lay off 1,000 in the eastern hemisphere - as well as similar plans by peers Schlumberger NV and Baker Hughes Inc, which Halliburton is buying for roughly $35 billion - sparked concern that the companies would cull large portions of their North Dakota staffs, steps that would have a negative economic ripple effect. Such fears, for now, appear unwarranted.Continental Resources Inc, North Dakota's second-largest oil producer, did not return a call seeking comment on staffing levels. Chief Executive Harold Hamm, though, bragged in a Tuesday press release that Continental's North Dakota acreage continues ""to provide exceptional results.""

Eurasia said on Friday the company and Schlumberger were continuing to cooperate with the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS) to respond to requests for information regarding the deal.It said the merger, including the delisting of its global depositary receipts in London, would not occur in the first quarter as it had previously announced. FAS approval is essential for all major mergers or acquisitions. Eurasia said it would make a further announcement once all conditions set out in the merger agreement had been satisfied, including that ""no further notification to, or review by, FAS is required"". Eurasia, whose shares lost about 60 percent of their value last year because of the weakening Russian economy and increased competition from the likes of state oil producer Rosneft , intends to go private by delisting from the London Stock Exchange before the deal is completed.Last month, Schlumberger said it had an option to buy the remaining shares in Eurasia during a two-year period commencing three years from the closing of the initial transaction.

778,"  Oilfield giants Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) and Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and many others in the oil and gas industry have announced plans to lay off thousands of people in the past few months as global oil prices have halved since June.In March, Brent prices LCoc1 fell to a near six-year low, hurt by a global supply glut and OPEC's decision not to curtail production. This prompted oil producers to trim their budgets and lower the number of rigs planned for 2015, hurting their suppliers and service providers.Smaller oil services company Weatherford said last month it would eliminate the position of chief operating officer, while tiny oil and gas producer Resolute Energy Corp (REN.N) said it would slash its CEO's base pay by 96 percent.  Oil major BP Plc (BP.L) said it would freeze its base pay across the company this year, while Basic Energy Services (BAS.N) said it has implemented salary cuts for all management and administrative employees and made changes to some benefit programs.  The job cuts announced so far would not be sufficient to maintain profitability, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein wrote in a note on March 16. The offshore oil services industry in the United States and Europe has to cut 10-15 percent more jobs over 2015, they said.

779,"  The U.S. shale oil industry may have forever abandoned its heavy-spending ways in the face of sliding crude prices, Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N), the world's No.1 oilfield services provider, said on Monday.Spending cuts already announced by producers - to the tune of 25 to 60 percent - have dropped the rig count by 45 percent since late 2014, and output will soon decline or flatten out so prices can recover, Schlumberger Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said. U.S. oil prices CLc1 have fallen by 50 percent since June to below $50 per barrel as growing supplies of tight oil from shale and oil sands in North America overwhelm weak global demand.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has refrained from cutting output to lift prices, a move Kibsgaard said may be part of an effort to test the resilience of higher cost producers.At the time of $100 oil, some highly-leveraged U.S. players were known for their intensive capex budgets. That has changed.""Going forward, we believe financial prudence, where investments are limited to the cash flow generated byproduction, will be the new normal for U.S. tight-oil developments,"" he said at the Scotia Howard Weil Energy conference in New Orleans. Outside of North America, Schlumberger expects the oil and gas industry's international spending on exploration and production to drop by 10 to 15 percent in 2015, continuing a trend seen last year.He said this is related to a ""sharp reduction"" in deepwater exploration activity that could delay the sanctioning of new developments, adding that the company is seeing lower activity and pricing pressure in the Gulf of Mexico. That means, he said, ""the global oil market is clearly heading for a tightening ... in the second half of this year."" The rebalancing would come in part from less supply but also stronger demand in a market currently oversupplied by about 1 million barrels per day.Schlumberger, which has seen its share price fall by about a third since July, would be positioned to take advantage of any uptick in demand for its range of oilfield services, from drilling to fracking, Kibsgaard said.He emphasized that Schlumberger has been generating more free cashflow than its two main competitors, Halliburton Co (HAL.N) and Baker Hughes Inc (BHI.N), which are in the process of merging. But he also acknowledged that the industry is going through a rocky downturn.""In the short term, activity visibility still remains limited as many of our customers are making drastic andsometimes unpredictable cuts to protect margins and cash flow,"" he said.

796,"  NEW YORK, April 17 An eventual recovery in U.S. oil drilling activity after the biggest slump in three decades may never reach last year's frenzied pace, according to the world's largest oilfield services company.The drilling recovery will likely to be slower to emerge due to a growing reserve of wells that have been drilled but not yet hydraulically fractured and increased activity in re-fracking wells that are running dry, Schlumberger Ltd Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said in a conference call Friday.Schlumberger expects the rebound in U.S. onshore drilling ""will be pushed out in time as the inventory of uncompleted wells drilled and the refracturing market expand,"" Kibsgaard told analysts following the announcement of the company's earnings.The recovery ""will fall well short of reaching previous levels.""The message suggests that the disconnect between rigs drilling for oil and the trajectory of U.S. production may get worse before it gets better. While U.S. output rose in tandem with the number of rigs in the early years of the shale boom, output has continued climbing even as the rig count collapses to less than half its October peak. The decline in oil rigs slowed this week but left their number at the lowest since 2010, Baker Hughes Inc, another oil services firm, said separately on Friday.Now, fracking a backlog of wells and reviving existing ones could mean that oil production begins to recover even as the number of rigs drilling new wells remains depressed. ""There were a number of people still out there who were still expecting a v-shaped recovery,"" said James Wicklund, managing director of equity research at Credit Suisse.The recovery will instead be shaped like a bathtub, scraping along the bottom, with drilling levels remaining depressed for the coming four to five years, he said. In part, the return to drilling will lag because producers will begin to frack drilled uncompleted wells - wells that have been opened up, but have not yet had the oil extracted from them.""At least 2,700 wells have been identified as candidates for refracture in North America,"" said James West, an analyst at EvercoreISI.The Eagle Ford likely contains 1,000 of these wells, known as DUCs, according to West's estimate, while the Bakken has about 500, and the Marcellus, Niobrara, and Haynesville each contain over 300 candidates. The market value of these opportunities together is about $5 billion, he said.

803,"  (Adds details, analyst comments, updates markets)* Core capital goods orders fall 0.5 percent in March* Core capital goods shipments slip 0.4 percent* Durable goods orders jump 4.0 percent on transportationBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, April 24 U.S. business investment spending plans fell for a seventh straight month in March, weighed down by a strong dollar and lower energy prices, suggesting the economy was struggling to rebound from a recent soft patch.The report from the Commerce Department on Friday came on the heels of lukewarm data on retail sales, employment and housing starts that have hinted at insufficient growth momentum that could prompt the Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until later this year.""This is consistent with a sluggish rebound in growth. It's shedding more doubt on the Fed's willingness to raise rates mid-year,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, declined 0.5 percent last month after a revised 2.2 percent drop in February, which was the biggest decline since July 2013.The so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have declined 1.1 percent in February. Economists had forecast these orders gaining 0.3 percent last month. The weakness mirrors other manufacturing indicators such as industrial production and various regional factory surveys.The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the report, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. U.S. stocks were trading marginally higher as investors were cheered by strong results from Google Inc, Amazon.com Inc  and Microsoft Corp.The Fed has kept overnight interest rates near zero since December 2008, but a number of officials have said an increase will likely be considered at its June policy-setting meeting.MANUFACTURING STRUGGLING  Manufacturing has been undermined by the buoyant dollar, whose 12.1 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since last June has eroded overseas profits of multinational companies like Procter & Gamble Co.The world's largest household products maker on Thursday reported a 8.3 percent decline in quarterly sales.In addition, lower energy prices have cut into domestic oil production, reducing demand for equipment by oil-field companies, including Schlumberger and Halliburton .Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oil-field services provider, has cut its capital expenditure plans for this year by about $500 million to $2.5 billion. Halliburton slashed its capex by about 15 percent to $2.8 billion.""Cheap oil and a strong dollar, while beneficial to consumers, are putting serious pressure on manufacturers,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York. The dollar and reduced capex spending by oil-field firms combined with a harsh winter and softer global demand to slow U.S. growth at the start of the year.In March, shipments of core capital goods - which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement - fell 0.4 percent after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in February.Shipments in February were previously reported to have risen 0.3 percent. As a result, JPMorgan lowered its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 0.6 percent annual pace.Barclays trimmed its forecast to a 1.1 percent rate from a 1.2 percent pace. The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The government will publish its snapshot of first-quarter GDP next Wednesday.Pointing to prolonged weakness in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, unfilled orders for core capital goods fell for a second straight month in March after barely rising in January.""We have not seen the full ramifications of the strong dollar and the drop in oil-related investment, so that could continue to play out,"" said Thomas Costerg, a U.S. economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. ""The focus is now on services and consumers in the hope that they are going to pick up the tab.

Last month, Schlumberger said it planned to buy a 45.65 percent stake in Eurasia for about $1.7 billion, potentially paving the way for it to become the sole owner of Russia's most active oilfield services company.Russian authorities have been concerned about complications that could arise from future international sanctions impeding the activity of investors operating in Russia. The deal requires approval from the governmental commission. Eurasia Drilling and FAS declined immediate comment.Eurasia, whose shares lost about 60 percent of their value last year because of the weakening Russian economy and increased competition from state oil producer Rosneft, intends to go private by delisting from the London Stock Exchange before the deal is completed.

(bloom.bg/1HRYqUb) Share prices of both companies dropped on the report. Halliburton spokeswoman Susie McMichael said in an email to Reuters that the company was fully committed to its target of closing the acquisition in late 2015. Baker Hughes declined to comment.Halliburton has said it was willing to sell three drilling businesses to satisfy anticipated Justice Department concerns. Halliburton said on Monday that it was ""pleased with the prices and level of interest"" it had received. The second source called the potential purchasers ""impressive.""The Justice Department concern focused on two areas, according to the first source. One is that the drilling technology businesses would go to small companies that could not effectively compete with the two leaders. The other is that the leaders would have less incentive to innovate. Halliburton and Baker Hughes have overlapping businesses in the United States, Asia and Europe, and the deal is being scrutinized by regulators in several countries.The second source, who believes regulators will ultimately approve the deal, said the companies knew going into the antitrust probe that divestitures would be needed, and that these were under discussion. The Justice Department has not said if it was satisfied, said the source, who noted that the agency was far from ready to make a final decision.The source also said it would be unusual for the department to sue because of an expected loss in innovation.Halliburton has said it was confident of achieving cost synergies of nearly $2 billion from the Baker Hughes deal.Shares of Baker Hughes closed down 3.9 percent at $58.28 while Halliburton finished down 0.8 percent at $41.54.

Sources told Reuters on July 22 U.S. Justice Department officials were concerned the merger could stifle innovation and drive up prices in the industry.Halliburton's statement said the European regulators' request came as a response to a standard notification form it filed with the commission on July 23. ""Both Halliburton and Baker Hughes continue to work constructively with the DOJ on the investigation,"" the statement said. ""Halliburton is fully committed to a target of closing the acquisition in late 2015, though the acquisition agreement provides that the closing can be extended into 2016, if necessary.""The combined company would overtake Schlumberger NV  as the No. 1 oilfield services provider.

Igor Artemyev, head of Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (FAS), said the FAS had signed a nine-point agreement with Schlumberger regarding the bid last summer.A government commission must now make its decision on the deal. ""I'm not sure if there will be requirements for any additional points, but any of the bodies may put forward their proposals,"" RIA quoted Artemyev as saying.The deal to sell the stake to New York-listed Schlumberger has met with resistance in Russia's higher echelons of power, according to a senior government official speaking on the condition of anonymity.A source, familiar with the deal, said that it was probably a clause in the contract which opens the door to Schlumberger taking control of Eurasia which has irked some authorities. A Schlumberger spokesman has said the company ""is still committed to building on our successful collaboration with Eurasia Drilling Company and taking a minority position"".""Meanwhile, we are still awaiting on a formal response from the authorities,"" he said.Yana Yakovleva, head of Moscow-based non-profit organisation Business Solidarity, said the government has taken Russian President Vladimir Putin's advice to gradually refuse foreign help.""In the end, the party line to substitute imports will hit the effectiveness of domestic oil and gas production,"" she said.

845,"  (Updates estimates in paragraph 13 and adds day of Apple earnings announcement)By David RandallNEW YORK Oct 26 U.S. companies are far from optimistic that next year will see them get a break from the tough economic and market conditions they have faced in 2015. And that may well hurt capital investment and jobs growth.In the first three weeks of October, 165 American companies have cited the slowing global economy in their outlooks for earnings and revenue. That is up from 108 in the same period last year, and 97 in the year-earlier quarter, according to an analysis of earnings reports by Thomson Reuters.Among the phrases that have appeared in many of those statements are ""challenging macroeconomic environment,"" or ""global headwinds.""Earnings and revenue have been depressed this year largely because of the strong dollar, economic weakness in China and Brazil, and tumbling oil and commodities prices.The rise in the value of the American currency means that profits earned in foreign currencies are worth less when translated into dollars, possibly making American exports less competitive.The weakness in major emerging markets has hit sales by U.S. multinationals and the plunge in the prices of energy, metals and minerals have not only hit oil producers and miners but the manufacturing and service companies who sell to them.The problems are clearly not across the board, as shown by better-than-expected results reported last Thursday by technology heavyweights Amazon.com Inc, Google-owner Alphabet Inc, and Microsoft Corp. They are all benefiting from the expansion of cloud-based computing.But among the major companies to announce job cuts in recent weeks are industrial conglomerates United Technologies Corp  and General Electric Co, technology giant Hewlett-Packard Co., and the world's largest oilfield services provider Schlumberger.Even social media company Twitter Inc, and biotechnology group Biogen Inc have said they are cutting jobs. Large employers announced 205,759 U.S. job cuts in the third quarter, the largest amount since the third quarter of 2009, according to a report from outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.Caterpillar Inc, meanwhile, told analysts that it expects its capital spending to be ""less than half of what it was in 2012,"" while appliance maker Whirlpool Corp  lowered its capital spending for 2015 to between $700 million and $750 million, down from a previous forecast of $750 million to $800 million.Those moves are coming at a time when overall corporate earnings in the third quarter are on pace to fall by 2.8 percent from this time last year. So far 59 percent of companies have reported revenues that have fallen below analyst estimates, according to Thomson Reuters data.And expectations for 2016 are falling as well - in July analysts were predicting that corporate earnings per share in the first two quarters would grow 9.2 percent and 13.7 percent, respectively; those figures now are down to 4.7 percent for the first quarter and 6.2 percent for the second.The companies own forecasts, meanwhile, are falling short of expectations at the greatest pace since June 2014, according to a BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report. Companies ""have a reason to be worried. This isn't a major economic slowdown, but a meaningful one, and once you see a reduction in risk taking you will see a reduction in growth,"" said Paul Hoffmeister, a portfolio manager with the Quaker Funds.REBOUND POSSIBLE Few expect the economy to go into a free-fall, of course. Should the dollar and oil prices stabilize, the prospects for many companies could improve quickly and their earnings and revenue could beat expectations, setting the stage for a stock rally.Some consumer-driven companies also continue to do well, both in the U.S. and even in China, where both Nike Inc  and toy-maker Mattel have said they still see high rates of growth. Apple Inc, which reports its quarterly results Tuesday, has said that China remains a big part of its growth plans. And some multinationals who have taken a pounding, such as household products giant Procter & Gamble Co, have signaled they may be turning a corner. P&G said it sees sales growth strengthening in the second half of the year, as it focuses on more profitable lines such as Pampers diapers and Tide detergent.Many of those feeling the pinch from slowing growth overseas are the same companies that just a few years ago were counting on China and other emerging economies to bolster their bottom lines.For example, International Business Machines Corp, which cut its full-year profit forecast, said fewer big deals in China caused revenue from that country to fall 17 percent in the third quarter.Alan Gayle, a portfolio manager at RidgeWorth Investments, said that he has been increasingly moving more of his equity portfolio into U.S.-based companies that have limited exposure to China and other emerging markets.""I've pulled back from my China and emerging market exposure until there are clearer signs that the economy has stopped slowing,"" he said, adding that he expects that top-line revenue growth will continue to be a challenge for U.S. companies there.Yet he remains guardedly optimistic that oil and other commodity prices are nearing a bottom, and that consumer spending in the U.S. and Europe should remain steady.""We think the chances of a global recession remain quite low,""  he said.(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, Robin Paxton and Bill Berkrot; Editing by Linda Stern, Martin Howell and Bernadette Baum)",2015-10-26,SLB,"Mon Oct 26, 2015 | 1:47pm EDT","UPDATE 1-With global outlook weak, many U.S. companies tighten belts",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-companies-outlook-idUSL1N12Q1IO20151026?type=companyNews,0.9929,0.045,0.862,0.093
846,"  * Venezuela, Iran push OPEC to lower production* No sign yet of Saudis changing course* Russia maintains Nov output at post-Soviet record* Schlumberger to cut more jobs as low oil price hurtsBy Alex Lawler and Vladimir SoldatkinVIENNA, Dec 2 Saudi Arabia has come under increased pressure from fellow OPEC members to cut output to prop up prices as the group meets this week amid one of the most severe oil gluts in its history.OPEC is widely expected to stick to its policies - enforced by Saudi Arabia's oil minister Ali al-Naimi a year ago - of defending market share by pumping record volumes to drive rival, higher-cost producers out of the market.But while the Saudis can claim a partial victory over the U.S. shale oil boom, production from top non-OPEC rival Russia has kept surprising on the upside and its own members Iraq and Iran are set to add new barrels. World oil stockpiles are at a record, according to the International Energy Agency. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday said his country, OPEC's traditional price hawk, would push for a 5 percent output cut to shore up prices when OPEC meets on Friday. OPEC is currently producing some 1.7 million bpd above ceiling""Our (oil) minister Eulogio del Pino will put forth a very clear proposal to respect production ceilings,"" Maduro said. ""The hour has come to put the oil market in order.""Iran has also asked OPEC members to respect the production ceiling of 30 million barrels per day. It wants OPEC to be prepared to accommodate new volumes as soon as Western sanctions on the country are lifted next year.Oil prices have more than halved to $45 per barrel over the past 18 months due to a U.S. shale oil boom and high OPEC production levels. The decline was steep enough to deal a severe blow to the U.S. oil industry - where production costs are some of the highest in the world.Oil services giant Schlumberger said on Tuesday it would cut more jobs, adding to 20,000 already this year, citing low oil prices and a growing oversupply.""It has become clear that any recovery in activity has been pushed out in time,"" said Schlumberger's president of operations Patrick Schorn. FEELING PAIN But outside the United States the signs of a slowdown in supply are thin. Fresh data on Wednesday showed OPEC's biggest rival Russia held its output steady in November at a post-Soviet high.Russian output has repeatedly surprised OPEC on the upside over the past year. A year ago, Saudi's Naimi said output from ageing Siberian fields was set to decline: ""Others will be harmed greatly before we feel any pain,"" he said.Moscow has allowed its currency to weaken over the past year to adjust to lower prices and oil firms have ramped up drilling.Last week, U.S. bank Merrill Lynch said Saudi Arabia may have to devalue its currency, pegged to the U.S. dollar, or ultimately cut production to protect its budget revenues.Several non-Saudi OPEC delegates told Reuters they hoped Naimi would listen to other members, whose finances are much more limited than those of Riyadh and need an urgent boost from higher oil prices.""I hope this time it will be different, but I doubt it will be,"" one OPEC delegate said. Another delegate said he still saw no indication an agreement on cuts could be reached on Friday.

It had cut 20,000 jobs earlier in 2015.Schlumberger's cost of revenue fell 35 percent in the three months ended Dec. 31, while revenue fell 39 percent.""With the year-end U.S. land rig count 68 percent lower than the 2014 peak, at less than 700 rigs, the massive over-capacity in the land services market offers no signs of pricing recovery in the short to medium term,"" Chief Executive Paal Kibsgaard said. Oil and gas companies that use the services provided by Schlumberger and other oilfield companies have slashed spending by 50-70 percent in response to persistently weak oil prices.Oil companies could slash 2016 spending by around 20 percent if oil prices hover at $40, Barclays said in its annual survey of 225 companies worldwide released earlier this month.  Oil futures, however, were trading at about $30 on Thursday, after dropping to their lowest levels since 2003 earlier in the week on worries of a growing crude glut and slowing demand due to economic weakness, especially in China.   Net loss attributable to Schlumberger was $1.02 billion, or 81 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $302 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier.  Excluding restructuring and asset impairment charges of $1.46 per share, profit was 65 cents, above the average analyst estimate of 63 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue of $7.74 billion missed the average analyst estimate of $7.78 billion.

856,"   By Foo Yun Chee | BRUSSELS  BRUSSELS The world's biggest oilfield services company Schlumberger (SLB.N) is set to gain unconditional EU approval for its $14.8 billion bid for equipment maker Cameron International Corp CAM.N, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday.The acquisition will enable Schlumberger to offer a broader range of products at lower prices to oil companies, which are slashing spending in response to falling oil prices, and boost its market share.Antitrust experts have said the two U.S. companies offer complementary product lines, meaning the deal would draw less regulatory scrutiny.Schlumberger's relatively smooth passage with regulators contrasts with a larger proposed energy services tie-up, Halliburton's (HAL.N) proposed $35 billion takeover of Baker Hughes (BHI.N), which has stirred worries with watchdogs on both sides of the Atlantic. It is now the target of a full-scale investigation by the European Commission because of concerns it could push up prices for oil and gas exploration in Europe.Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso declined to comment. Schlumberger spokesman Joao Felix said the company typically does not discuss merger and acquisition opportunities. Cameron International did not immediately reply to an email for comment. The EU competition enforcer is scheduled to decide on the deal by Feb. 5.U.S. antitrust regulators cleared the deal without conditions in November last year. The companies expect to close the merger in the first quarter. Schlumberger last week said it would cut 10,000 jobs in the fourth quarter amid a prolonged oil price slump.

861,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. employment gains slowed more than expected in January as the boost to hiring from unseasonably mild weather faded, but rising wages and an unemployment rate at an eight-year low suggested the labor market recovery remains firm.Non-farm payrolls increased by 151,000 jobs and the unemployment rate slipped one-tenth of a percentage point to 4.9 percent, the lowest since February 2008, the Labor Department said on Friday. The payrolls gain was a sharp step-down from the average 231,000 jobs per month during the fourth quarter.""The fact that payroll gains fell back to earth is not necessarily a bad sign. Most indications are that the job market in the U.S. is on solid footing and improving,"" said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS in Lexington, Massachusetts.Economists had forecast employment increasing by 190,000 in January and the jobless rate steady at 5 percent. The economy added 2,000 fewer jobs in November and December than previously reported.On top of a 0.5 percent jump in average hourly earnings, which was the biggest gain in a year, employers increased hours for workers. Manufacturing, which has been undermined by a strong dollar and weak global demand, added the most jobs since August 2013.Economists said the combination of strong wage growth and falling unemployment suggested a March interest rate increase from the Federal Reserve could not be completely ruled out.The dollar rose against a basket of six major currencies on the data after hitting a roughly 15-week low on Thursday. Prices for U.S. government debt initially fell, but pared losses as stocks on Wall Street extended their decline. ""The lower unemployment rate and rising wages further support the view that the labor market is doing nothing but tightening,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""Clearly, there are more uncertainties today than when the Fed raised rates in December and hinted that there could be four increases this year. But the labor market is absolutely not one of them.""Tightening financial market conditions and signs that both the domestic and global economies were slowing had undercut the case for a Fed rate hike next month and lowered the probability of monetary policy tightening this year. The U.S. central bank raised its short-term interest rate in December for the first time in nearly a decade. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has said the economy needs to create just under 100,000 jobs a month to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The economy, especially voters' perceptions of their job prospects, will likely be an issue in the November elections. President Barack Obama lauded the labor market progress.""This progress is finally starting to translate into bigger paychecks. The United States of America right now has the strongest, most durable economy in the world,"" Obama told reporters at the White House. Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, however, said the economy was ""still failing the millions of Americans who have given up looking for work.""  WEATHER PAYBACK January's softer job gains were payback after the warmest temperatures in years bolstered hiring in weather-sensitive sectors like construction. January employment also lost the lift from the hiring of couriers and messengers, which was buoyed in November and December by strong online holiday sales.The economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, restrained by headwinds that included the strong dollar and efforts by businesses to sell off inventory. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed the buoyant dollar cutting into exports in December, causing the trade deficit to widen 2.7 percent to $43.4 billion. In January, the unemployment rate fell even as more people entered the labor force. The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job rose one-tenth of a percentage point to 62.7 percent. It remains near four-decade lows. Low participation could crimp job growth as the supply of labor shrinks, unless a strong rise in wages lures more people back into the labor force. The private sector accounted for all employment gains in January, adding 158,000 positions. The services sector created 118,000 jobs, the fewest in 10 months. That was because temporary help services fell 25,200 and courier and messenger employment declined by 14,400 jobs. Hiring in these categories normally rises during the holiday season.Educational services lost 38,500 jobs, but retail payrolls added a strong 57,700 positions. Hiring could slow in the months ahead after a number of retailers, including Walmart (WMT.N) and Macy's (M.N) announced dozens of store closures.The embattled manufacturing sector surprisingly added 29,000 jobs last month, while mining laid off 7,000 more workers. Mining payrolls have decreased by 146,000 since peaking in September 2014. About three-fourths of the job losses over this period have been in support activities for mining. Further losses are likely after a report on Thursday showed energy firms in January announced plans to lay off 20,246 workers. Oil prices have plunged about 70 percent in the last 18 months, forcing firms like oilfield services provider Schlumberger (SLB.N) to slash their workforces.Construction payrolls rose 18,000, cooling off after adding 146,000 jobs in the fourth quarter.

Hiring could slow in the months ahead after a number of retailers, including Walmart (WMT.N) and Macy's (M.N) announced dozens of store closures.The embattled manufacturing sector surprisingly added 29,000 jobs last month, while mining laid off 7,000 more workers. Mining payrolls have decreased by 146,000 since peaking in September 2014. About three-fourths of the job losses over this period have been in support activities for mining. Further losses are likely after a report on Thursday showed energy firms in January announced plans to lay off 20,246 workers. Oil prices have plunged about 70 percent in the last 18 months, forcing firms like oilfield services provider Schlumberger (SLB.N) to slash their workforces.Construction payrolls rose 18,000, cooling off after adding 146,000 jobs in the fourth quarter. Government employment fell 7,000.

863,"   By Hillary Flynn and Laura Benitez  NEW YORK/LONDON, Feb 11 (IFR) - US companies are lining up euro deals that could give the moribund European corporate bond market a much needed boost after a dire start to the year.US issuers have already borrowed 2.3bn this year, around a quarter of the total euro corporate supply, and a new wave of issuers are readying deals to take advantage of lower yields and more stable spreads after the US primary market stayed shut for the fifth straight day on Thursday.Goldman Sachs tapped euros for the second time in less than a week on Wednesday, following a number of corporate issuers over the past fortnight that have sold euro deals - including oil outfit Schlumberger and industrial gases company Praxair.Bankers are now preparing potential bonds from technology and manufacturing company Honeywell, biotech group Amgen and aircraft manufacturer United Technologies, tipped to be a bumper multi-tranched bond, according to leads on the deal.A record number of US corporates issued in the euro market last year, accounting for 57bn of the 253bn issued in the European investment-grade market, according to IFR data.LOWER ALL-IN The main reason for the interest is lower yields in the euro market, which are especially appealing for US borrowers keeping funds in the single currency.That attraction could grow if the Federal Reserve embarks on more rate hikes, while at the same time the European Central Bank contemplates more easing. Marc Fratepietro, co-head of Americas investment-grade debt capital markets at Deutsche Bank, put the differential between the two currencies for some companies at up to 150bp.Schlumberger, for example, raised 600m from a three-year deal last week at a yield of 0.674% - a fraction of the 2.35% it paid on a US$1.3bn three-year sold back in December.Even higher-than-average premiums sparked by the recent volatility are not expected to deter US companies - which are more pragmatic than their European counterparts - from targeting euros.""US issuers are not as price sensitive versus secondaries as Europeans. Some print euros only once a year so they won't split hairs,"" one European DCM official said. Others point out that European spreads have held up relatively well in the recent sell-off.""In the midst of the recent market volatility dollar spreads underperformed their euro counterparts for the same issuers,"" Bank of America Merrill Lynch credit analyst Yuriy Shchuchinov said in a note published Wednesday.He estimated that dollar spreads of European issuers have widened 20bp relative to euros since mid-January (adjusted for the cross-currency basis) and put the differential at 44bp, the widest since January 2015.US issuers' dollar spreads also underperformed euros, but to a smaller extent, he added. BEWARE THE BASIS However, for those companies thinking about swapping back to US dollars, the economics are not as attractive.""For a company to issue in euros and then swap it back to dollars it would cost them a lot, around 40bp on the five-year,"" another banker told IFR.Two years ago that would only have cost 8bp, and last year around 25bp.But bankers said the majority of US issuers looking to tap euros actually want the euro exposure.""Issuing in euros creates a hedge for their European businesses, because now they're match funding their European activities with their euro debt,"" the banker said.""In a world where the euro is expected to depreciate the value of the currency hedge is pretty meaningful to them.""

Since then, oil prices have fallen by more than 55 percent. Faced with opposition from the Justice Department, the companies may either cancel the planned tie-up or fight the government in court. The deal is one of several that antitrust enforcers have rejected as illegal during the recent wave of mergers of large, complex companies.Share prices for Baker Hughes closed down 5.1 percent at $39.36 Tuesday while Halliburton ended up 1.2 percent at $34.40.Halliburton and Baker Hughes both declined comment.The two sides had been discussing asset sales aimed at saving the deal, which was originally valued at $35 billion but is now valued at about $25 billion based on the decline in Halliburton shares.  If the deal collapses due to antitrust concerns, Halliburton must pay Baker Hughes a $3.5 billion breakup fee, according to regulatory filings.The proposed deal also has hit headwinds in Europe, where the European Union's competition authority was concerned that the proposed merger would reduce competition and innovation in more than 30 product markets. Regulators in Australia also flagged concerns about the massive tie-up.As far back as July 2015, Reuters reported that there were concerns in the U.S. government that the merger would lead to higher prices and less innovation.The Justice Department's worry then focused on two areas. One was that the drilling technology businesses that were divested would go to small companies that could not effectively compete with the two leaders. The other was that the leaders would have less incentive to innovate. Baker Hughes in particular has been aggressive in developing new oilfield technologies, part of its appeal to Halliburton from the beginning. Baker Hughes developed smartphone apps to help customers in the field decide in real time how best to hydraulically fracture new wells. Furthermore, uniting Halliburton and Baker Hughes would create a dominant leader in North Dakota with more than half the cementing market and a leading position in fracking.Lower oil prices had given investors hope that the companies' best path forward was together, especially as demand for their products and services evaporate as customers slashed budgets.

American companies are competing in the estimated $2 billion Algerian energy service market with Chinese companies Sinopec and CNPC whose service affiliates have become more active in the North African country in recent years.With oil prices down, Algeria's government has suspended some infrastructure projects and cut budget spending, but Sonatrach says it will continue with its ambitious investment plan to increase oil and gas production.

Shares in Ophir, which had projects in Africa and East Asia, fell as much as 25 percent on Friday, eroding the company's market value by over 160 million pounds ($233 million).Ophir CEO Nick Cooper said the company was in talks with a number of other ""quality counterparties"" that could offer funding. He did not disclose any names.Stifel analysts said Schlumberger's exit had put a question mark on the read-through value of the project, especially as the deal had fallen through after the U.S. company had done its due diligence. Fortuna, Africa's first deepwater independent floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, is one of a number of projects planned when prices were higher.The field is expected to produce 2.2 million tons per annum and Ophir currently has an 80 percent working interest in the field, according to its website.Under the head of terms agreement signed in January, Schlumberger had agreed to take a 40 percent economic interest in the project. The company would have reimbursed Ophir for half of its previous costs in the project, which was expected to help cover Ophir's share of capital expenditure up until first gas sales.""(Schlumberger's exit) raises obvious questions how Ophir can move the project forward,"" Liberum analyst Andrew Whittock told Reuters.Ophir pushed back expectations for a first investment decision on the project on Friday, saying it would take time to reach binding deals with other potential partners.A decision on first investment will be made in the fourth quarter of 2016 and first production will is expected by early 2020, the company added.It had earlier expected to make its investment decision in mid-2016, with production in 2019.Ophir shares had pared some of their earlier losses by 1000 GMT, but were still on track for their worst day ever.

Oil producers have said their ability to keep pumping oil without spending more was due to lower prices for oilfield services and better production techniques that drastically lower costs for each new well, while yielding more oil.But Kibsgaard said the low costs were not indicative of a ""permanent improvement in the underlying industry performance"", emphasizing there had be no fundamental changes in technology, quality efficiency, collaboration or the industry's business model.

917,"   By Alexandra Ulmer and Mircely Guanipa | CARACAS/PUNTO FIJO, Venezuela  CARACAS/PUNTO FIJO, Venezuela Oilfield services company Schlumberger has let go of workers and pulled out of projects as it cuts operations in crisis-stricken Venezuela, sparking worker protests and heightening worry over the OPEC country's slumping oil output.Schlumberger in April said it would reduce activity in the South American OPEC nation, which accounted for less than 5 percent of the company's consolidated revenue last year, due to insufficient payments and no improvements on the horizon. As a result, employees working on projects ranging from the oil-rich Maracaibo Lake to the Orinoco Belt are being laid off, workers and a union leader said, an ominous sign for Venezuela's slumping crude production and crumbling economy. ""They're getting rid of almost all the workers because they're reducing operations and the contracts won't be renovated because of debt owed by PDVSA,"" said a Schlumberger employee in Venezuela's eastern city of Maturin, asking to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak with media. Houston-based Schlumberger declined to comment. Caracas-based PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment.Ivan Freites, a union leader and fierce PDVSA critic, said some 600 workers are being fired in Zulia state, whose capital is Maracaibo, and 2,000 workers are being let go nationally. While the exact number of laid-off workers was not immediately clear, the dismissals could further stoke social unrest as Venezuelans struggle to eat three meals a day amid worsening food shortages and triple-digit inflation.Some Schlumberger workers protested the layoffs in Maracaibo on Wednesday. A worker in Venezuela's oil-rich Orinoco Belt said Schlumberger had scaled back its projects and was now only working on Petropiar, a joint venture between PDVSA and U.S. oil company Chevron, and Petromonagas, a joint venture between PDVSA and Russian oil giant Rosneft.

918,"   By Alexandra Ulmer and Mircely Guanipa | CARACAS/PUNTO FIJO, Venezuela  CARACAS/PUNTO FIJO, Venezuela Oilfield services company Schlumberger has let go of workers and pulled out of projects as it cuts operations in crisis-stricken Venezuela, sparking worker protests and heightening worry over the OPEC country's slumping oil output.Schlumberger in April said it would reduce activity in the South American OPEC nation, which accounted for less than 5 percent of the company's consolidated revenue last year, due to insufficient payments and no improvements on the horizon. As a result, employees working on projects ranging from the oil-rich Maracaibo Lake to the Orinoco Belt are being laid off, workers and a union leader said, an ominous sign for Venezuela's slumping crude production and crumbling economy. ""They're getting rid of almost all the workers because they're reducing operations and the contracts won't be renovated because of debt owed by PDVSA,"" said a Schlumberger employee in Venezuela's eastern city of Maturin, asking to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak with media. Houston-based Schlumberger declined to comment. Caracas-based PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment.Ivan Freites, a union leader and fierce PDVSA critic, said some 600 workers are being fired in Zulia state, whose capital is Maracaibo, and 2,000 workers are being let go nationally. While the exact number of laid-off workers was not immediately clear, the dismissals could further stoke social unrest as Venezuelans struggle to eat three meals a day amid worsening food shortages and triple-digit inflation.Some Schlumberger workers protested the layoffs in Maracaibo on Wednesday. A worker in Venezuela's oil-rich Orinoco Belt said Schlumberger had scaled back its projects and was now only working on Petropiar, a joint venture between PDVSA and U.S. oil company Chevron, and Petromonagas, a joint venture between PDVSA and Russian oil giant Rosneft.  PDVSA, exclusive operator of Venezuela's vast oilfields, has run up billions of dollars in unpaid bills to service providers as a result of cash-flow problems amid a deep recession. U.S. oil services company Halliburton Co in April also said it would begin curtailing activity in Venezuela. It also declined to comment on its scale-back.

933,"   By Malathi Nayak | NEW YORK  NEW YORK AT&T Inc's upcoming DirecTV Now online video service will cost $35 per month, including mobile streaming costs, and target viewers who shun pay-television subscriptions, Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on Tuesday.The wireless company's streaming video service, which launches late next month, will have more than 100 channels, Stephenson said at the WSJ.D Live conference in California. AT&T said on Saturday that it would buy Time Warner Inc for $85.4 billion, as it looks to diversify its business into the media and entertainment market.The Time Warner deal gives AT&T control of cable TV channels HBO and CNN, film studio Warner Bros and other coveted media assets. Time Warner content will be incorporated into the upcoming video service, Stephenson said. ""Thirty-five dollars, you don't find that for a hundred channels in the marketplace, with wireless streaming,"" Stephenson said. AT&T is betting big on mobile video to tap new revenue as the U.S. wireless market stagnates. AT&T acquired DirecTV for $48.5 billion in 2015, making it the largest U.S. pay-TV operator with 25.3 million video subscribers. AT&T is entering a crowded market that services viewers who increasingly consume video online rather than through cable and satellite television services. Dish Network Corp's Sling TV offers about two dozen channels for $20 a month, while Sony Corp's PlayStation Vue has packages as big as 100-plus channels for $55 a month.Online video service Hulu will roll out a new live TV bundle of broadcast and cable network channels early next year.

939,"   By Lehar Maan  Hard-disk drive maker Seagate Technology Plc's (STX.O) second-quarter results missed analysts' estimates as growth slowed in its cloud storage business, sending its shares down 7 percent in extended trading.Weakness in the cloud business was due to long-term rollouts by some of its original-equipment manufacturer customers, with shipments down ""a couple of hundred thousand units"", Chief Financial Officer Pat O'Malley told Reuters.OEMs had accounted for about 68 percent of the company's total revenue as of June, according to a regulatory filing.O'Malley, who counts Google (GOOG.O) among Seagate's customers, said cloud comprised 10-15 percent of its total revenue in the second quarter ended December 27.The finance chief said he expects the cloud business to contribute about 20 percent to the company's total revenue by the end of the year.Seagate and rival Western Digital Corp (WDC.O) are tapping into the growing demand for products that help store data in the cloud and reducing their dependence on personal computer hard drives as consumers shift to smartphones and tablets. Global PC shipments fell 10 percent last year, the worst annual drop since research firm Gartner began tracking them.Seagate also forecast current-quarter revenue of $3.4 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $3.46 billion.""They lost on the enterprise, which is the higher-margin category,"" FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi said.

The finance chief said he expects the cloud business to contribute about 20 percent to the company's total revenue by the end of the year.Seagate and rival Western Digital Corp are tapping into the growing demand for products that help store data in the cloud and reducing their dependence on personal computer hard drives as consumers shift to smartphones and tablets.Global PC shipments fell 10 percent last year, the worst annual drop since research firm Gartner began tracking them.

Luczo, 57, had been a member of Microsoft's board since May 2012. He was the board's youngest and newest member until the appointment of Mason Morfit last week, and was regarded by Wall Street as one of the more tech-savvy directors. Microsoft has had trouble keeping younger board members recently.

943,"   By Noel Randewich and Bill Rigby | SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE, July 11  SAN FRANCISCO/SEATTLE, July 11 Improved demand for personal computers after years of declines may not last as emerging markets remain weak and recent corporate upgrades in the United States and Europe may prove fleeting.The latest sign that the PC market's stability could be short-lived came from technology distributor Synnex Corp . Its shares have slumped 16 percent since Chief Executive Officer Kevin Murai warned earlier in July that increased demand was already waning from companies buying new computers to upgrade their operating systems after Microsoft Corp stopped supporting Windows XP in April.Investors have pushed shares in PC mainstays Microsoft and Intel Corp and parts suppliers such as Seagate and Western Digital Corp to decade- or record-highs, partly on bets that the global slump in PC demand that began with Apple Inc's launch of the iPad in 2010 may have hit bottom.But detractors point out the story is far from certain. Demand is still falling in emerging markets such as China, crucial to any sustained comeback. While up to a quarter of the world's PCs still employ the 13-year-old Windows XP, it is unclear how many will choose tablets or Apple and Google Inc  ""Chrome"" computers over PCs, rather than upgrade to newer Windows versions.""If this is only a couple quarters of flat growth and all of a sudden we go down to 5 and 7 percent year-over-year declines again, then people are going to get nervous and say we don't know where the bottom is,"" said Chuck Jones, founder of research firm Sand Hill Insights. Intel reports its second-quarter results on Tuesday, while Microsoft posts earnings on July 22 and both are likely to shed more light on the state of the global PC market. Seagate, which reports on July 17 and Western Digital, which gives its results on July 30, could fill in the picture further.BETTER SENTIMENT  Optimism on Wall Street has grown since Intel unexpectedly raised its quarterly and annual revenue outlooks in June, sending its shares to levels not seen in a decade. Microsoft's stock is at highs last seen in 2000.Shipments of PCs were flat in the June quarter, according to research firm Gartner, a better-than-expected result. ""Market feedback on the PC space is much better than 18 months ago,"" memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc  President Mark Adams told Reuters in June. ""We've been talking and planning about the back half of the year with our customers and  they're pretty focused on making sure we don't take away (DRAM) capacity."" DRAM chips are widely used in PCs.Global tablet shipments in the March quarter fell for the first time ever, according to NPD DisplaySearch. U.S. consumers who once thought they would get by with a tablet are gravitating toward cheap laptops.""The PC is not dead. There is a healthy market under there,"" FBR analyst Chris Rolland said, pointing to a gradually improving U.S. economy.But in China and other developing countries, once major growth engines for the PC industry, shipments of laptops are still falling as consumers choose tablets. It is unclear to what extent people in developing countries will eventually follow wealthier U.S. consumers back to buying both tablets and laptops, said IDC analyst Loren Loverde.Even Microsoft no longer sounds as confident in the PC's prospects. In a recent TV commercial, it described its newest Surface Pro as a ""tablet that can replace your laptop,"" a major shift for a company that still depends on PCs for a sizeable amount of revenue.

953,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 24 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB-' rating to  Seagate HDD Cayman's (Seagate HDD) $300 million of 20-year senior unsecured  notes offering. The notes will be guaranteed by Seagate Technology plc  (Seagate), the parent company of Seagate HDD. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Net proceeds from the debt offering will be used for the redemption of all  outstanding 6.8% senior notes due 2016, of which $331 million were outstanding  as of Oct. 3, 2014. The senior notes offering and concurrent redemption (the  transaction) are consistent with Seagate's efforts to reduce its weighted  average cost of debt and extend its debt maturity schedule. Seagate's net $31 million debt reduction will result in a Fitch estimated  decrease in total leverage (total debt to operating EBITDA) to 1.36x as of Oct.  3, 2014, from 1.37x prior to the transaction. Fitch anticipates Seagate's  leverage will remain near 1x through the intermediate term.  Fitch anticipates interest coverage (operating EBITDA to gross interest expense)  will remain near 15x through the intermediate term. Fitch estimates this metric  will increase to 13.6x versus 13.4x prior to the transaction. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Ratings and Outlook reflect: --Continued expectations for relatively stable hard disk drive (HDD) pricing due  to a highly consolidated industry structure, with the market leaders, Seagate  and Western Digital Corp. (WDC), controlling approximately 84% of the market;  solid long-term growth in heads and media, key components of an HDD; and tightly  managed capital expenditures across the supply chain that minimizes the risk of  supply and demand imbalances. --Positive profitability trends from a favorable mix shift toward higher  capacity HDDs for cloud computing that utilize greater media and heads per  drive, thereby absorbing a greater amount of fixed-cost investments than lower  capacity PC drives. --Solid liquidity and financial flexibility supported by $2.2 billion in cash,  the vast majority of which is readily accessible without adverse tax  considerations, positive annual free cash flow (FCF), and an undrawn $500  million senior unsecured revolving credit facility due April 2018. --Strong credit protection metrics and management's commitment to conservative  financial policies. --Broad product portfolio, significant scale in the HDD industry and vertically  integrated model, which reduces per-unit manufacturing costs and facilitates  new-product time to market, albeit resulting in a greater fixed cost base that  exacerbates cyclical effects. Fitch's rating concerns include: --Long-term threat of technology substitution from NAND flash-based solid state  drives. Fitch believes, however, the high relative cost of flash-based storage  will continue to limit SSD storage capacity in PCs and tablets, thereby  increasing demand for HDDs in external or cloud storage. Enterprises using SSDs  deploy a multi-tiered storage strategy whereby the vast majority of data is  stored on HDDs and only data for high performance applications is stored on  higher cost SSDs. --Substantial historical volatility in earnings and FCF due to the cyclicality  of HDD demand and significant fixed costs; --Moderating, but still consistent, declines in average selling prices for HDDs  due to low HDD switching costs; --Event risk associated with implementation of aggressive shareholder-friendly  activities, primarily debt-financed share repurchases; --Seagate's ability to sustain a time- to-market advantage critical to achieving  market share gains and maintaining overall profitability, given formidable  competition from WDC. RATING SENSITIVITIES Positive:  --Future ratings upgrades are currently unlikely due to the long-term threat of  technology substitution from SSD, where Seagate lacks a dominant product  position relative to HDDs. Negative: --If the cost per gigabyte differential between enterprise HDD and SSD narrows  significantly, resulting in greater than expected cannibalization of enterprise  HDDs, and Seagate's enterprise SSD products are uncompetitive; --If Seagate's enterprise market share materially erodes on a sustained basis  due to more formidable competition from WDC; --If the company pursues more aggressive financial policies, such as sizable  debt-financed share repurchases; --If Ultrabooks with SSD materially cannibalize the traditional notebook market,  SSHs fail to achieve significant penetration in the Ultrabook market, and growth  in near-line enterprise and external HDDs is insufficient to offset the decline  in EBs shipped to the notebook HDDs. Fitch forecasts more than $1.9 billion of annual FCF (cash from operations less  capital expenditures and dividends) through the intermediate term and calculates  FCF was $1.35 billion in the latest 12 months (LTM) ended Oct. 3, 2014. This is  down from $1.39 billion in the corresponding year ago period.  Financial covenants in the credit agreement consist of minimum fixed-charge  coverage of 1.5x and maximum net leverage ratio of 1.5x. In addition, the  facility requires minimum liquidity of $500 million. Fitch estimates total debt, all of which was issued by Seagate HDD Cayman, is  approximately $3.78 billion pro forma for the transaction and consists of: --$800 million of 3.75% senior notes due November 2018; --$506 million of 6.875% senior notes due May 2020; --$172 million of 7% senior notes due November 2021; --$1 billion of 4.75% senior notes due June 2023; --$1 billion of 4.75% senior notes due January 2025;  --$300 million of senior notes due November 2034.

Activists have aggressively targeted U.S. companies over the last five years, pushing for better cash management, leadership changes and new strategies.Companies often resist activist campaigns, and sometimes the contention results in a proxy fight, where the hedge fund tries to replace board members with its own nominees. ""Seagate approached ValueAct to execute this transaction and become an investor in our company, given their commitment to and success in creating long-term value for the companies in which they invest,"" Seagate Chief Executive Officer Steve Luczo said in the statement.Some other companies have also been more receptive toward activists in the last year. Industrial conglomerate General Electric, for example, said it welcomed Trian Partners' purchase of a stake in October.  ValueAct will obtain 9.5 million Seagate shares through a so-called secondary block trade, the company said. That means that rather than buying shares on the open market, it will exchange them with an existing Seagate investor, who was not identified. The sale, which Seagate expects to complete by the end of the month, will make ValueAct one of its largest shareholders.ValueAct's recent investments include a $1.1 billion stake in investment bank Morgan Stanley, where the firm has not yet demanded a board seat or agitated for major changes. The San Francisco-based fund also said in July that it bought a 6.8 percent stake in railcar maker Trinity Industries Inc worth around $111 million. ValueAct, which with more than $16 billion under management is one of the largest activist investors, has invested in Seagate before.

That means that rather than buying shares on the open market, it will exchange them with an existing Seagate investor, who was not identified. The sale, which Seagate expects to complete by the end of the month, will make ValueAct one of its largest shareholders.ValueAct's recent investments include a $1.1 billion stake in investment bank Morgan Stanley, where the firm has not yet demanded a board seat or agitated for major changes. The San Francisco-based fund also said in July that it bought a 6.8 percent stake in railcar maker Trinity Industries Inc worth around $111 million. ValueAct, which with more than $16 billion under management is one of the largest activist investors, has invested in Seagate before. Other tech industry investments by ValueAct include Microsoft Corp, where it has a board seat. The firm also had a stake in Adobe Systems Inc that it sold.

The answer is not necessarily,"" said Peribere, who was appointed CEO in March 2013.The unit, which makes floor cleaning machines, detergents and stain removers for commercial clients such as hotels and hospitals, has struggled with a strong dollar and a slowdown in some of its end-markets. Growth in profit margins at the unit has been sluggish, lagging the company's food care and product care businesses.Peribere said the acquisition of Diversey had put Sealed Air's growth at risk as the company did not have expertise in the new technology and was dealing with new customers. ""We will have to think about (a sale or a spinoff) one day. There is no urgency for that,"" he said.Diversey's profit margins rose to 11.6 percent in 2015 from 10.2 percent in 2012. In contrast, margins at the food care business increased to 20.3 percent from 15.4 percent, and at the product care unit to 20.8 percent from 16.9 percent. However, sales at the Diversey unit, on a constant currency basis, have picked up during Peribere's tenure. The CEO said he expects Diversey's sales to increase by about 4 percent on a constant currency basis in the 2017-2019 period.Sealed Air's food care business makes wrapping and vacuuming packaging systems for perishable food items and beverages, while the product care business houses protective packaging brands including Bubble Wrap.

997,"   By Ayesha Rascoe | WASHINGTON, March 31  WASHINGTON, March 31 The U.S. environmental regulator has raised concerns that a federal review of Sempra Energy's proposed liquefied natural gas export project did not include an assessment of the potential effects of more natural gas drilling.The Environmental Protection Agency issued its finding earlier this month. It urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to weigh indirect greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental effects that would flow from the increase in gas drilling needed to support exports from the Cameron plant in Louisiana.The Department of Energy approved exports from the project in February, but the plant must still get clearances from FERC.The EPA's assessment is a fresh angle in the long running debate of how much LNG the U.S. should export. FERC should ""consider the extent to which implementation of the proposed project could increase the demand for domestic natural gas extraction, as well as potential environmental impacts associated with the potential increased production of natural gas,"" the EPA said in response to the commission's draft review of the project.The finding, dated March 3, was released by FERC late on Friday.FERC has long resisted calls from environmental groups such as the Sierra Club to consider the effects of shale gas production in its review of the safety and environmental impacts of LNG export facilities. A spokeswoman said FERC would take the EPA's comments and other public input into consideration as it crafts its final environmental review, currently set for release by April 30.Energy analysts said FERC will probably decide there is no need for an extensive analysis of the indirect greenhouse gas emissions that would be caused by one LNG export project. A federal appeals court ruled in FERC's favor in 2012 in a similar case regarding Crestwood Midstream Partner's  Marc 1 natural gas pipeline. In that case, environmental groups argued that the commission should have done a more expansive review of the impact of natural gas production.""I don't think FERC will defer to Sierra Club's or EPA's issues on the upstream unless or until regulations change,"" said Christi Tezak, energy analyst for ClearView Energy Partners.The shale gas boom, spurred by advances in drilling techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has led to record U.S. natural gas production and paved the way for the United States to become a major gas exporter.Fracking involves injecting water, sand and chemicals underground at high pressure to extract fuel. Critics have blamed the practice for water contamination and say that increased drilling is polluting the air.

998,"  WASHINGTON, April 2 Federal regulators should approve construction of Sempra Energy's liquefied natural gas export project by mid-June, the chair of the U.S. Senate Energy Committee said on Wednesday, arguing that the government needs to move swiftly to keep U.S. gas exports competitive.Louisiana's Mary Landrieu urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to release its final environmental review of the project by April 30, as planned, and then to move forward to issue a license.The project, at Sempra's Cameron LNG terminal in Hackberry, Louisiana, won conditional approval from the U.S. Department of Energy to export LNG earlier this year, but it needs permission from FERC before construction can begin. ""We must make certain that the regulatory process for approval of LNG facilities such as (Sempra's) Cameron LNG does not disadvantage American exporters in the battle for the huge international LNG market,"" Landrieu said in a letter to FERC. Landrieu is a major advocate for her home-state project and has taken a more aggressive approach in support of gas exports than did her predecessor, Oregon's Ron Wyden, who raised concerns about unlimited gas exports and their potential to raise domestic prices, hurting the manufacturing sector. Landrieu said her office found that no significant new issues were raised in response to FERC's draft review of Cameron project, which concluded that the plant would not cause major environmental damage.Last month, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a finding that said FERC's draft report was insufficient. The EPA urged the commission to assess the impact of the increased natural gas drilling that would be needed to support gas exports before releasing its final review.

1001,"  (Adds Sempra statement paragraph 5 and details from order)By Ayesha RascoeWASHINGTON, June 19 U.S. regulators on Thursday approved Sempra Energy's  bid to build a liquefied natural gas export terminal in Louisiana, opening the door to a significant expansion of the American role in global gas trade.Sempra's Cameron LNG facility was the second gas export project to get the green light to begin construction from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the first since 2012, when FERC permitted Cheniere's Sabine Pass project.With the FERC approval in hand, Cameron will likely soon receive its final permit from the Energy Department allowing the facility to export gas to all countries, which would make it the only project outside of Sabine Pass fully licensed at the federal level.The Energy Department issued a conditional export permit for Cameron in February, contingent upon the project receiving a construction license from FERC. ""Today's approval is another important step in delivering natural gas to America's trading partners abroad,"" Debra Reed, chief executive of Sempra Energy, said in a statement.Cameron, Sabine Pass and more than two dozen other projects are in a race to sell relatively cheap, abundant U.S. shale gas to foreign countries where it can fetch higher prices. A vocal coalition of heavy industrial companies, led by Dow Chemical, has argued that this push for gas exports could raise domestic energy prices and hurt the economy if left unchecked.But many Republicans and some Democrats from gas-producing states have pressed for federal regulators to move quickly to issue decisions on applications, warning that the United States could lose out to other countries such as Qatar and Australia seeking to export natural gas.Companies must receive approval from FERC regarding the safety and environmental impact of their projects before they can begin construction. The commission's order required Sempra to comply with more than 75 conditions to mitigate the project's effects on the surrounding area.The Energy Department determines whether requests to export LNG to countries without free trade agreements with the United States are in the national interest.Sempra shares, which posted record highs on Wednesday and early Thursday in anticipation of FERC approval, were near steady at $104.10 in midday U.S. trading.Approval of the Cameron project comes as FERC's review process faces greater public scrutiny. An Energy Department proposal made in May, currently out for public comment, would require companies to have a construction license from FERC before DOE will act on their export applications.

1003,"  (Adds background, comment from Senator Hoeven)By Ayesha RascoeWASHINGTON, Sept 10 The U.S. Energy Department on Wednesday approved liquefied natural gas exports from two projects, as lawmakers pressed the administration to move quickly to clear a backlog of applications to ship gas abroad.Sempra Energy's Cameron LNG facility in Louisiana and Carib Energy's small-scale export project in Florida are the first projects to receive final permits from the department to export gas to non-free-trade-agreement countries since Cheniere's Sabine Pass project was approved in 2012.Until now Sabine Pass was the only project fully permitted at the federal level.The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission granted the $10 billion Cameron project a construction license in June after it was issued a conditional export permit by the Energy Department earlier in the year. With the final permit from the Energy Department, the Cameron facility will be able to export up to 1.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day for up to 20 years.Cameron, Sabine Pass and more than two dozen other projects have lined up to sell gas overseas. Companies and some lawmakers have complained the department's process has moved too slowly, with the agency pausing application reviews for nearly two years to examine the economic implications of the LNG exports.A vocal coalition of heavy industrial companies, led by Dow Chemical, has argued that the push for gas exports could raise domestic energy prices and hurt the economy if left unchecked. Lawmakers from oil- and gas-producing states welcomed the latest approvals. Senator John Hoeven, of North Dakota, said the orders issued today were a step in the right direction but more must be done.""You need a dependable, rational and certain process for approval,"" Hoeven told Reuters. Hoeven, who has introduced legislation setting a deadline for the department to act on applications, said there is broad support in Congress to address the issue. He said he expects Congress will pass a bill next year expediting the LNG export review process.Facing pressure from Congress, the Energy Department revamped its review process last month, doing away with conditional approvals.The Carib project was approved under this new process, which allows the department to issue decisions on applications only after federal environmental reviews are completed.An environmental review was waived for Carib LNG, a subsidiary of Crowley Maritime Corp, because the exports would be coming from a natural gas liquefaction facility that's already undergone the necessary assessments.Carib's small operation would move up to 0.04 billion cubic feet a day of gas in LNG shipping containers to countries in the Caribbean and Central and South America.

It did not say how much Pavilion would pay for the LNG.Pavilion has also purchased 0.4 million tpy of LNG from Sempra Energy's Cameron LNG project in Louisiana, which will be delivered to Asia according to its production schedule, a company spokeswoman said in an email. The U.S. Energy Department on Sept. 10 gave Sempra the green light to export LNG from the project.Singapore aims to position itself as an LNG trading hub for Asia, with links to producers such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Australia and countries with growing demand such as China, India and Thailand.Temasek Holdings, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, created Pavilion last year, providing it with a $6.9 billion war chest. Pavilion has already used the funds to buy a stake in a gas field in Tanzania and start an LNG shipping joint venture.A month ago, Pavilion signed a 10-year deal with France's Total to buy 0.7 million tpy of LNG from 2018. BP will supply the LNG from its global portfolio of equity and merchant sources, Paul Reed, chief executive of BP Integrated Supply and Trading, said in the statement issued by Pavilion.""This includes the Freeport LNG Project in the U.S., where BP holds tolling rights and which is expected to reach a final investment decision before the end of 2014,"" Reed said.Pavilion Energy said the time was ripe for an Asian LNG hub as import-export terminals and storage facilities are in place and the region is gradually shifting from long-term contracts to a spot market. The company is also working with the Singapore Stock Exchange, IE Singapore, regional governments and commodity exchanges to develop a Singapore LNG price marker, Seah Moon Ming, chief executive of Pavilion Energy and Pavilion Gas, said at an industry conference.The price gauge will be independent of the oil market and better reflect regional demand-supply balances, Seah said.LNG sold to Asia is mostly pegged to the Japan Crude Cocktail (JCC) price, which is often higher than gas price benchmarks in Europe and the United States.Asian buyers currently pay a premium for LNG, which amounted  to almost $130 billion in 2012, according to Pavilion Energy.While the recent downturn in spot prices ""posed a pricing challenge for gas producers, it was a wonderful opportunity for traders who were able to buy and store spot for seasonal trade"", Seah said.Pavilion Energy has stored an LNG cargo at the Singapore LNG terminal for trading purposes, he said.

1010,"  (Repeating for additional clients without changes to text)By Nichola GroomLOS ANGELES, July 2 Fifteen years ago, California led the way to cleaner transit buses with strict tailpipe emissions standards that effectively ushered out diesel as the primary fuel for buses in the state and replaced it with natural gas.Now, California is poised once again to take the lead, this time by mandating a switch to so-called ""zero-emission"" buses by 2040.The new push by California's powerful Air Resources Board (CARB) has the potential to marginalize natural gas as a bus fuel in the same way its adoption once marginalized diesel.In response, the California Natural Gas Vehicle Coalition has proposed expanding the definition of ""zero-emission vehicles"" to include not just electric buses, but also those powered by so-called ""renewable natural gas,"" which is produced from cow manure or decomposing organic matter in landfills.Whereas regular natural gas offers a reduction in greenhouse gases of about 15 to 20 percent over diesel, renewable natural gas offers a reduction of about 90 percent over diesel, according to the coalition .""That's going to be a tremendous step forward over where we are today,"" said Tim Carmichael, president of the coalition, which includes T. Boone Pickens-backed fuel provider Clean Energy Fuels Corp, utility Sempra Energy and engine maker Westport Innovations Inc, among others.The stakes are high. About 60 percent of California buses now run on compressed natural gas, or CNG, compared with 17 percent nationwide. And with roughly one seventh of the nation's 67,000 transit buses operating on California's roads, the state is a crucial market for both bus manufacturers and fuel suppliers.TRADE-OFFS  California's 12-member Air Resources Board will decide the issue next year after a review of available bus technologies.     But so far, it has said it is disinclined to allow anything but true zero-emission transit vehicles, citing a state goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050.""We are looking at zero emissions where feasible,"" said Tony Brasil, a CARB official.One impediment to that approach could be whether the available electric and fuel cell buses can meet the needs of the state's transit agencies.As of March, there were 22 battery-powered electric buses and 7 fuel-cell powered buses in California transit fleets, according to CARB.Today, agencies looking to purchase electric buses can choose between vehicles that need to be removed from service for hours of charging every 155 miles or so-called ""fast-charging"" buses that must stop for 5 minutes of recharging after traveling about 30 miles. By contrast, buses powered by diesel or natural gas can travel about 300 miles before refueling.Another potential issue is that power delivery systems at transit agencies would likely need to be upgraded to accommodate electric buses. ""If you have a yard with 200 buses, is there enough power in the neighborhood to run that at this point?"" asked Steve Miller, chair of the California Transit Association's zero emissions bus task force. ""We'd like to see that vetted out prior to a regulation going on the books.""Fuel cell buses have a much longer range than those powered by battery, but they also lack fueling infrastructure.MATTERS OF COST Critics of the proposed regulation have also cited expense as a factor. Battery electric buses typically cost about $800,000, compared with $525,000 for a natural gas bus and less than $500,000 for a diesel bus. Fuel cell buses currently cost about $1.3 million.But electric bus advocates counter by citing the higher cost of natural gas. Fueling a natural gas bus costs about $27,000 annually, compared with $10,500 in electricity cost for an electric bus, according to CARB. Electric buses, advocates note, also have lower maintenance expenses, which means the cost of maintaining an electric bus is roughly equivalent to that of one powered by natural gas when figured over the 12-year average lifespan of a bus.CARB has pledged to spend up to $70 million to support purchases of electric buses this year.The state is also supporting electric bus production. Proterra, a startup electric bus manufacturer, will open a new factory in California later this year with help from a $3 million state grant, and China's BYD was given state tax breaks to make its buses in the state.But even with financial support, transit agencies worry that their systems would have to undergo massive logistical changes to accommodate large numbers of battery electric buses.Steve Schupak, who is running the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's test of five BYD electric buses, said switching even 15 percent of the agency's fleet over to electric buses ""would drastically change the way we operate.""With renewable natural gas, the industry argues, buses can achieve ""near zero"" emissions without the higher cost of vehicles that are still unproven on the road in large numbers.Moreover, the natural gas players say, even electric buses aren't true zero-emission vehicles. They are pressing CARB to also consider the greenhouse gases emitted by power plants in generating electricity for buses.""Will you just be using natural gas generation to charge the buses?"" said Rodger Schwecke, vice president of customer solutions for the Southern California Gas Company.For the present, at least, demand for renewable natural gas is on the rise, as transit agencies seek short-term ways to reduce their climate emissions. Los Angeles County's transit agency, the nation's second-largest, says it plans to switch all of its buses to run on RNG, a move that will reduce its carbon emissions by more than 78 percent without investing in additional infrastructure, according to spokesman Paul Gonzales.Clean Energy Fuels, the nation's largest provider of natural gas fuel for transportation, said it is on track to sell 40 million gallons of RNG this year, double what it sold last year.

Proterra, a startup electric bus manufacturer, will open a new factory in California later this year with help from a $3 million state grant, and China's BYD was given state tax breaks to make its buses in the state.But even with financial support, transit agencies worry that their systems would have to undergo massive logistical changes to accommodate large numbers of battery electric buses.Steve Schupak, who is running the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority's test of five BYD electric buses, said switching even 15 percent of the agency's fleet over to electric buses ""would drastically change the way we operate.""With renewable natural gas, the industry argues, buses can achieve ""near zero"" emissions without the higher cost of vehicles that are still unproven on the road in large numbers.Moreover, the natural gas players say, even electric buses aren't true zero-emission vehicles. They are pressing CARB to also consider the greenhouse gases emitted by power plants in generating electricity for buses.""Will you just be using natural gas generation to charge the buses?"" said Rodger Schwecke, vice president of customer solutions for the Southern California Gas Company.For the present, at least, demand for renewable natural gas is on the rise, as transit agencies seek short-term ways to reduce their climate emissions. Los Angeles County's transit agency, the nation's second-largest, says it plans to switch all of its buses to run on RNG, a move that will reduce its carbon emissions by more than 78 percent without investing in additional infrastructure, according to spokesman Paul Gonzales.Clean Energy Fuels, the nation's largest provider of natural gas fuel for transportation, said it is on track to sell 40 million gallons of RNG this year, double what it sold last year.

1014,"  Southern California Gas Co is to be arraigned on criminal charges on Wednesday over a huge methane leak near Los Angeles that forced thousands of residents from their homes, officials said.SoCalGas, a division of San Diego-based Sempra Energy, faces four misdemeanor charges for failing to report the release of hazardous materials from Oct. 23 to Oct. 26, and discharging air contaminants beginning on Oct. 23.Attorneys for SoCalGas will attend Wednesday's arraignment in Los Angeles County Superior Court in Santa Clarita, company spokesman Javier Mendoza said. Mendoza said the company operated the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and did not believe a criminal prosecution was warranted.If convicted, the company could be fined up to $25,000 a day for each day that it failed to report the gas leak to the California Office of Emergency Services, said county District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Jane Robison. The company also could be fined up to $1,000 per day for air pollution violations, she said. The leak stems from an underground pipeline rupture at the company's 3,600-acre (1,457-hectare) Aliso Canyon natural gas storage field. The largest such leak ever in California, at its height it accounted for a fourth of all methane emissions statewide.Methane fumes sickened scores of people and prompted the relocation of more than 6,600 households from the Porter Ranch community at the edge of the field.Southern California Gas Co said last week that it had temporarily controlled the flow of natural gas spewing from a pipeline, but more work needed to be done before the leak would be permanently sealed. ""We provided a prompt notice of the leak to multiple agencies,"" Mendoza said. He declined to provide a list of those agencies or say whether the California Office of Emergency Services was among them.When asked how the company would plead to the charges, Mendoza said: ""We do not believe that a criminal prosecution is warranted and we look forward to presenting evidence ... through the legal process."" Robison said the company may not enter a plea on Wednesday. Los Angeles County prosecutor Jackie Lacey filed the charges on Feb. 2, the same day California Attorney General Kamala Harris also sued the company. SoCalGas also faces a slew of private lawsuits filed on behalf of area residents. (Reporting by Eric M.

1015,"  WASHINGTON A new U.S. government task force will look into the country's biggest ever accidental release of methane, which occurred over several months in Los Angeles, California, hoping to prevent future leaks of the potent greenhouse gas from storage wells, the Obama administration said on Friday.The Interagency Task Force on Natural Gas Storage Safety to look at the leak at the Aliso Canyon leak will be chaired by officials from the Department of Energy and the Department of Transportation's pipeline safety office. A months-long leak at the Aliso Canyon storage field made scores of people ill and forced more the temporary relocation of more than 6,600 households from the northern Los Angeles community of Porter Ranch.Scientists said the global warming potential of the release, which began last October and was not plugged until February, was equal to the annual carbon emissions of nearly 600,000 cars.  ""The fact that this leak happened in the first place, the length of time that it took to fix, and the disruption that it caused for so many people are very concerning,"" Lynn Orr, a Department of Energy undersecretary, and Marie Therese Dominguez, the administrator of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, said in a release.     Aliso Canyon, owned by Southern California Gas Co a division of Sempra Energy, is the country's fourth largest gas storage field of its kind. The utility has minimized the extent of the greenhouse gas impact of the leak, citing early California state data, saying the release represented less than 1 percent of the state's entire annual greenhouse gas emissions.The Energy Department will hold workshops with industry, state and local leaders to develop practices for operation of storage facilities and ensure well integrity and response plans. Findings of the task force will be made public later this year.

TransCanada said on Monday the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan pipeline project would be built through a joint venture with a unit of Sempra Energy and be backed by a 25-year transportation service contract with Mexico's state-owned power company.TransCanada, which will own a 60 percent stake in the 800 kilometer (497 mile) pipeline and be its operator, will invest $1.3 billion in the project. Sempra's unit IEnova will hold the remaining stake.Spectra Energy Corp said on Monday its unit won a contract to build and operate a $1.5 billion natural gas pipeline in Texas, which would connect to the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan pipeline in Mexico. The unit, Valley Crossing Pipeline LLC, will build and operate the 1 billion cubic feet per day pipeline originating at Nueces County, Texas and extending to Brownsville, Texas.The Sur de Texas-Tuxpan pipeline, which is expected to be in service in late 2018, is the largest of three new Mexican projects recently announced by TransCanada.

1025,"  U.S. natural gas utility Southern California Gas (SoCalGas) kept fuel supplies flowing as temperatures rose this week, passing its first test of the summer since the closure of its Aliso Canyon storage facility.SoCalGas, a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy, shut Aliso Canyon after detecting a massive leak in October. The company plugged the leak in February.As residents in the Los Angeles area cranked up their air conditioners, SoCalGas said it delivered about 3.3 billion cubic feet of gas and received 3.2 bcf from pipelines, using 0.1 bcf from storage other than Aliso Canyon.With cooler weather on Tuesday, however, deliveries fell to an estimated 2.9 bcf, while pipeline receipts were expected to reach 3.1 bcf, allowing some injections back into storage.In the summer, SoCalGas strives to completely fill the 86.2-bcf Aliso Canyon to prepare for the upcoming winter heating season when gas demand peaks. In January, state regulators ordered SoCalGas to reduce the amount of gas in Aliso Canyon to just 15 bcf because of the leak. That 15 bcf is being held to reduce the risk of gas curtailments and power interruptions this summer. Aliso Canyon, located in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, is the biggest of SoCalGas' four storage fields. It provides service to the region's 17 gas-fired power plants, refineries and other key parts of California's economy.SoCalGas forecast demand this summer would peak around 3.2 bcf, with power generators using over 1.9 bcf, noncore large industrial customers like refineries using 0.6 bcf and core mostly residential customers using 0.6 bcf. While the SoCalGas system can accept up to 3.875 bcf of pipeline supplies, it usually only moves about 3 bcf and has not received more than 3.4 bcf per day at any time in the last five years, leaving storage to make up the difference.SoCalGas' three remaining storage facilities have a combined withdrawal capacity of 1.7 bcfd, but cannot make up for all of Aliso Canyon's capability to support demand in the Los Angeles Basin because they are smaller or located too far away. SoCalGas has said it hopes to return the facility to partial service by the end of the summer, but cannot inject gas into the field until it inspects all 114 wells.As of June 17, SoCalGas said it completed integrity tests on 23 wells, nine of which have already been approved by state regulators.

1030,"  Southern California Gas Co is not likely to return the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles to partial service until at least early autumn, according to conversations with regulators.The utility shut the field in October 2015 because of a massive methane leak, which was plugged in February.Under state law, SoCalGas cannot inject gas into Aliso Canyon until the California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) approves the company's testing of the 114 wells at the facility to make sure they are safe to operate.SoCalGas is owned by California energy company Sempra Energy and Aliso Canyon is the biggest of SoCalGas' four storage fields. It provides crucial gas and electricity supply to customers in Southern California.  According to its latest report on Sept. 2, SoCalGas said 20 wells passed all safety tests, 15 were awaiting test results and 79 were temporarily taken out of operation. That means there's more work to be done before DOGGR can call for a public hearing for comment on the results. Only after that comment period can DOGGR decide whether the utility has met its obligations. In addition to DOGGR, the state Public Utilities Commission also must approve before the company can inject gas into Aliso Canyon.SoCalGas spokesman Chris Gilbride said on Monday that 23 wells have since passed all tests, 20 of which have already received DOGGR approval.

1031,"   By Scott DiSavino  More wells  passed safety inspections at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles, Southern California Gas Co said on Monday, but the company has more work to do before it can inject gas into the giant field the utility shut last fall due to a massive methane leak that was not plugged until February.Under state law, SoCalGas cannot inject gas into Aliso Canyon until the California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (DOGGR) approves the company's testing of the 114 wells at the facility to ensure their safety.Several local groups want the storage field permanently shut, as do many residents who had to evacuate their homes due to the leak.SoCalGas is owned by California energy company Sempra Energy and Aliso Canyon is the biggest of its four storage fields. It supplies natural gas to homes and businesses in Southern California, including power plants and refineries.According to its latest report on Sept. 16, SoCalGas said 23 wells passed all safety tests, 15 awaited test results and 76 were temporarily out of operation. All wells must either pass all tests or be taken out of service before DOGGR can call a public meeting. Since DOGGR must give the public 15 days notice before a meeting, SoCalGas could not start injecting gas into Aliso Canyon until some time in October at the earliest.SoCalGas spokesman Chris Gilbride could not speculate on when the company may complete tests and return the storage facility to service.He said the company has completed all tests on 25 wells and 23 have received final DOGGR approval. In addition to DOGGR, the California Public Utilities Commission must also determine the field is safe to operate.The PUC has directed SoCalGas to maintain a minimum withdrawal capacity at Aliso Canyon to minimize the risk of gas shortages that could result in electricity outages. Once enough wells have passed all tests and received DOGGR approval to meet the PUC's withdrawal requirements, Gilbride said SoCalGas will temporarily plug the remaining wells and take them out of service.Once those wells have been plugged and isolated from the reservoir, SoCalGas can request authority to resume injections, he said.At that point, DOGGR and the PUC would be able to undertake their review and certification process, which will include a public hearing, as provided by Senate Bill 380, prior to SoCalGas resuming injections, he said.

1048,"  MEXICO CITY May 14 Mexican paint company Consorcio Comex said on Wednesday it was suing Sherwin-Williams  over the U.S. paint maker's failed attempt to acquire it, arguing that the U.S. company had not tried hard enough to honor a deal struck between the two.Sherwin-Williams said in November 2012 it had signed an agreement to purchase Comex for $2.34 billion, but the deal was rejected twice by Mexico's federal competition watchdog on the grounds it would create unfair market conditions.Mexico's Federal Economic Competition Commission (COFECE) said the tie-up would create a company with around 50 percent of Mexico's paint market which would make it eight times bigger than its nearest competitor. After the second rejection last October, Sherwin-Williams had until March 31 to change the offer, but its efforts to get the approval of COFECE in that period were ""well below"" the standards set out in the purchase agreement, Comex said. Comex said it had asked for the International Chamber of Commerce to arbitrate in its dispute with Sherwin-Williams, which terminated the purchase agreement in April.

1049,"  MEXICO CITY U.S. chemicals maker PPG Industries Inc (PPG.N) said on Monday it had agreed to buy paints maker Consorcio Comex SA de CV for $2.3 billion after the Mexican company's deal to sell to U.S. rival Sherwin-Williams Co (SHW.N) fell through.PPG Industries, whose shares were up 3 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, said in a joint statement with Comex that it plans to fund the acquisition primarily with currently held cash and short-term investments. The U.S. company added that it may fund part of the purchase price with debt.Mexico's federal competition authority twice rejected Sherwin-Williams' proposed $2.34 billion takeover offer for Comex last year, saying it would create unfair market conditions.Comex, a family-owned company founded in 1952, said in May it was suing Sherwin-Williams because it had not tried hard enough to honor the takeover agreement. The PPG deal is still subject to regulatory approvals but  the Mexican company said it was confident it would go through.""Being part of PPG gives us new growth opportunities and synergies,"" Comex Chief Executive Officer Marcos Achar Levy said.

Privately held Comex has eight manufacturing plants and six distribution centers and had sales of about $1 billion in 2013.PPG said in April that its board had authorized a $2 billion share repurchase agreement. The purchase would be the latest in a string of Latin American investments PPG has made in recent months. In June, the company said it would invest $40 million in expanding its coating manufacturing plant in Brazil.    In March, PPG said it would acquire Panama-based Canal Supplies, a manufacturer of protective marine coatings.Earlier that month, the company said it would invest more than $27 million in its coating manufacturing plant in San Juan del Rio, in central Mexico.

1074,"   By Phil Wahba  Signet Jewelers Ltd (SIG.N) is buying smaller rival Zale Corp ZLC.N for about $690 million, an acquisition it said would strengthen its place in the U.S. jewelry sector and let it tap new markets.The deal, announced on Wednesday, would combine the two largest U.S. mid-tier jewelry store chains, Zales and Signet's Kay Jewelers. The price of $21 per share is a 41 percent premium over Zale's close on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.The deal caps a multiyear turnaround for Zale, which last July reported its first profitable fiscal year since the 2008 financial crisis and in January posted strong holiday sales.The company's stock, which traded as low as $3.76 only 10 months ago, rose to $20.89 on Wednesday.The merger would also mean a big payday for Golden Gate Capital, which holds about 22 percent of Zale shares.The private equity firm gave Zale a $150 million lifeline in 2010, when it was running low on cash, and in return received warrants to buy 25 percent of the retailer's shares at $2 apiece.In the United States, Signet and Zale would have a combined 16 percent share of the specialty jewelry market, which is highly fragmented, according to IBISWorld data.The merger would also make Signet the biggest jeweler in Canada, where Zale operates the successful Peoples Jewellers chain. Signet would also gain a much bigger presence in the growing U.S. jewelry outlet business, where Zales Outlets is a leader.Other benefits include more leverage with diamond vendors at a time both companies are focusing on their bridal businesses, and annual savings of about $100 million from combining operations, Signet said. Investors agreed, sending Signet shares up 16.2 percent to $92.12.Signet Chief Executive Officer Michael Barnes told Reuters that the company had approached Zale about a deal in the autumn. It was not the first time the rivals discussed a combination; in 2006, Zale ended tentative, short-lived merger talks with its bigger rival.In 2010, Signet hinted that it would look at a deal to get a new nationwide U.S. jewelry chain, saying it would take too much time and money to build one.The deal is subject to Zale shareholders' approval. REVERSAL OF FORTUNES In 2009, debt-laden Zale went through a severe liquidity crisis that forced it to cancel orders right before the key holiday season, alienating vendors and customers to Signet's benefit.In the next two years, Zale made strides by closing unprofitable stores and adding exclusive brands like Vera Wang bridal jewelry, some of it costing as much as $17,000, at its now 90-year-old namesake chain.Barnes told Reuters that Signet would not combine Zales and Kay stores at malls that have both as long as each is profitable.Signet operates 1,400 U.S. stores, including its higher end Jared chain. Zale has about 800 Zales and Gordon's Jewelers stores, as well as 630 Piercing Pagoda mall kiosks. Buying Zale will also reduce Signet's reliance on its British chains, H. Samuel and Ernest Jones, which are market leaders but whose growth has been uneven in recent years.Zale will become a division of Signet. Zale CEO Theo Killion will manage that division after the deal, but will report to Signet CEO Barnes.Including debt, the all-cash deal values Zale at about $1.4 billion, the companies said.Signet said it expected the deal to increase earnings by a high single-digit percentage rate, excluding acquisition costs, in the first year after closing.The jeweler said it expected to finance the transaction through bank debt, other debt financing and converting a significant portion of its accounts receivables into cash.Signet said J.P. Morgan Chase Bank (JPM.N) had committed to provide bridge financing for the transaction. J.P.

1084,"   By Devika  Krishna Kumar  Signet Jewelers Ltd (SIG.N) said Chief Executive Michael Barnes resigned to be closer to his family, becoming the second top executive in three months to leave as the company digests its acquisition of Zale Corp, its largest deal so far.Shares of Signet, which also reaffirmed its third-quarter and full-year profit and sales forecast, fell as much as 5.4 percent in early trading on Tuesday.Barnes, who has been CEO since January 2011, resigned as he wanted ""to relocate nearer to his family"", the same reason Ronald Ristau gave when he resigned as chief financial officer in July.The parent of Kay Jewelers said Chief Operating Officer Mark Light would succeed Barnes, effective Oct. 31. Nomura Securities analyst Simeon Siegel said the two departures seemed unrelated. He said Barnes' resignation was not too much of a surprise, citing the CEO's comments on the company's last quarterly conference call that suggested a shift in the responsibility of day-to-day operations to Light.""Signet is passing the CEO baton to someone with proven success and execution of the business. We believe Mark has been instrumental and involved with all aspects of the recent guidance,"" he said, reiterating his ""buy"" rating on the stock. Light, in 2006, was made CEO of Signet's Sterling division, which operates over 1,400 stores in 50 U.S. states, mainly under the brand names Kay Jewelers and Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry. Under Light's watch, Sterling's sales have more than tripled.""Mark Light is a very strong choice to lead the company, with 36 years of experience at Signet and having grown the U.S. business to the powerhouse that it is today,"" Sterne Agee analysts wrote in a note.

Barnes, who has been CEO since January 2011, resigned as he wanted ""to relocate nearer to his family"", the same reason Ronald Ristau gave when he resigned as chief financial officer in July.The parent of Kay Jewelers said Chief Operating Officer Mark Light would succeed Barnes, effective Oct. 31.Nomura Securities analyst Simeon Siegel said the two departures seemed unrelated. He said Barnes' resignation was not too much of a surprise, citing the CEO's comments on the company's last quarterly conference call that suggested a shift in the responsibility of day-to-day operations to Light. ""Signet is passing the CEO baton to someone with proven success and execution of the business.

Trump's promises of tax cuts, higher spending on infrastructure and simpler regulations in the banking and healthcare industries have led a rally, especially in those sectors, since the election on Nov. 8.""Optimism is returning because of the potential that exists in the form of fiscal stimulus, infrastructure spending and tax cuts and is renewing confidence on the part of investors and consumers,"" said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Boston Private Wealth in New York.The consumer discretionary sector was up 0.66 percent, leading the gainers among the 11 major S&P sectors, boosted by strong reports from Dollar Tree and Signet Jewelers.The healthcare sector was the only laggard, dropping 0.74 percent, weighed down by Medtronic.

1098,"   By John Wasik | CHICAGO  CHICAGO Jan 13 If the stock market rally continues, last year's laggards may be this year's winners.Many of the sectors that could do well are late bloomers in the five-year bull run. They may not seem like obvious choices, yet are worthwhile if you're contrarian or slightly defensive.Assuming economic fundamentals and corporate earnings remain solid, it could be a decent year for stocks overall and even better for companies that were neglected in 2013.""I'm optimistic,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist for Mesirow Financial in Chicago, who predicts three-percent GDP growth and the creation of up to three million jobs this year.""I haven't felt bullish in a long time,"" Swonk said at the annual economic outlook luncheon of the Executive Club of Chicago on Jan. 9.REAL ESTATE REBOUND A surge in institutional buying came in 2012 among homebuilding stocks. But last year, Wall Street moved on and real estate underperformed every sector in the S&P 500 except for basic materials, rising just 6 percent for the year through Jan. 10, according to Morningstar.This year could be different if the economy continues to create more jobs and spur long-term demand for all kinds of real estate, from single-family homes to commercial storage units. The most recent Case-Shiller Home Price index report showed U.S. home prices posting their strongest annualized gain in seven years. There's still much pent-up demand for homes and commercial properties. With mortgage rates expected to remain relatively low, the real estate sector still has some promise.Exchange-traded funds that invest in real estate investment trusts are a worthy consideration, especially if you are looking for extra yield.Consider the iShares U.S. Real Estate ETF, which holds developers and property managers like Simon Property Group Inc, American Tower Corp and Public Storage . The fund was up only 1 percent last year, but yields nearly 4 percent. It charges 0.46 percent for annual expenses.MATERIALS MAKE SENSE  The materials sector was the most unloved group among the Standard & Poor's industry sectors last year, gaining less than 3 percent for the year through Jan. 10.  A highly-cyclical basket of metals, chemical, mining and paper stocks, this cadre tends to do best during mature economic cycles.But laggards can become leaders if U.S. economic growth - pegged at more than four percent in the 3rd quarter - continues.The Materials Select Sector SPDR owns stocks like Monsanto, Dow Chemical Co and Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold. The SPDR charges 0.18 percent for annual management expenses and outperformed the materials sector as a whole, gaining 26 percent last year.ENERGY SURGE  Energy was another lackluster sector last year, returning a modest 10 percent for the year ending Jan. 10, compared to the best-performing technology group, which gained 56 percent. Improving demand for energy globally bodes well for companies that produce oil and natural gas, though.The Vanguard Energy ETF owns leading producers and service companies such as ExxonMobil Corp, Chevron Corp  and Schlumberger NV. The fund charges 0.14 percent for annual expenses and returned 26 percent last year.UTILITIES STILL DEFENSIVE Companies that produce or distribute power, natural gas and water seldom light up any investor's radar screen during bull rallies. These high-dividend companies only become alluring when investors retreat from the most popular sector of the moment or there's widespread uncertainty.Since the bull rally will fizzle at some point, it's always good to have a fallback. Utilities fit that bill. Although these companies were firmly in the bottom tier last year, they could rebound if the market runs into trouble.Consider an ETF such as the iShares U.S. Utilities, which holds blue chips such as Duke Energy Corp, Dominion Resources and Exelon Corp. The fund returned almost 15 percent last year and yields about 3 percent with a 0.46 percent annual expense ratio.Feeling skittish about picking a lackluster U.S. sector and hoping it rebounds? A wiser choice would be to spread your portfolio among every sector through a broad-based world stock fund such as the iShares MSCI ACWI Index ETF, which holds the biggest stocks from around the world such as Apple , Nestle SA and General Electric Co. The fund rose 22 percent last year and charges 0.34 percent for annual expenses.",2014-01-13,SPG,"Mon Jan 13, 2014 | 2:52pm EST",COLUMN-Will last year's stock market laggards be 2014's winners?,http://www.reuters.com//article/column-wasik-laggards-idUSL2N0KN1K720140113?type=companyNews,0.9952,0.038,0.845,0.117
1099,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded the following credit  ratings for Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG) and Simon Property Group,  L.P. (collectively, Simon): Simon Property Group, Inc.  --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A' from 'A-'; --$75 million preferred stock to 'BBB+' from 'BBB'. Simon Property Group, L.P.  --IDR to 'A' from 'A-'; --$6 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities to 'A' from 'A-'; --$14 billion senior unsecured notes to 'A' from 'A-'. In addition, Fitch has assigned a rating of 'A' to Simon Property Group, L.P.'s  $300 million unsecured term loan due 2018, $600 million 2.2% notes due 2019, and  $600 million 3.75% notes due 2024.  The Rating Outlook is Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade to 'A' has two elements: first, improvements in the quality of the  company's retail real estate portfolio and second, improved liquidity. Pro forma  for the spinoff of the strip center business and smaller enclosed malls to  Washington Prime Group, Inc. (the spinoff) in 2Q'2014, fixed-charge coverage is  appropriate for the 'A' rating level.  The company has robust pro forma  liquidity coverage, driven in part by a low expected adjusted funds from  operations (AFFO) payout ratio.  This enables Simon to build unrestricted cash,  enhancing the company's ability to fund future investments and/or repay  unsecured debt as needed.   Credit strengths include Simon's excellent access to capital and management  track record as a capital allocator (e.g. via operations, development and  capital recycling).  Leverage is somewhat elevated for the 'A' level but  expected to decline over the next 12-to-24 months.   Spinoff Improves Asset Quality In December 2013, Simon announced the spinoff of its strip center business and  its smaller enclosed malls (each of the malls generated annual net operating  income (NOI) of approximately $10 million or less).  The spinoff entity,  Washington Prime Group, Inc. (WPG) will hold 54 strip centers and 44 mall  properties, and the spinoff is expected to occur in 2Q'2014.  The transaction  should improve SPG's asset quality as evidenced by higher mall occupancy (96.5%  pro forma compared with 96.1% at year-end) and higher tenant sales per square  foot ($616 pro forma compared with $582 at year-end).   The company's mall portfolio pro forma for the spinoff will include 178 mall  properties, 13 The Mills properties and 62 community/lifestyle centers.  Fitch  considers the portfolio 'prime' as it includes productive assets such as Forum  Shops at Caesars in Las Vegas, NV, The Galleria in Houston, TX, King of Prussia  Mall in King of Prussia, PA, and Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, FL.  Simon has  consistently outperformed its U.S. mall peers as measured by occupancy 60 basis  points (bps) above peers and same-store NOI 150 bps above peers from 2006 to  2013, evidencing 'prime' asset quality. Improving Fixed-Charge Coverage The company's same-store NOI growth, driven by mid-single-digit releasing  spreads and occupancy gains, along with a reduced cost of debt capital, improved  fixed-charge coverage to 3.1x in 2013 (3.2x in 4Q'2013) from 2.9x in both 2012  and 2011.  Releasing spreads averaged 14.9% in 2013 following 10.2% in 2012 and  9.5% in 2011.   Recently signed rents per square foot relative to 2014-2015 average expiring  rent per square foot indicate further upward momentum on releasing spreads pro  forma for the spinoff of WPG.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will  remain in the low-to-mid-3x range over the next 12-to-24 months, which is  consistent with an 'A' rating.  In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in  which the company's same-store NOI growth is consistent with 2009-2010 growth  (its weakest reported periods), fixed-charge coverage would remain in the low 3x  range, which would still be adequate for the 'A' rating.  Fitch defines  fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA including recurring cash  distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring capital expenditures  and straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total interest incurred and  preferred stock dividends. Opportunistic Growth Fitch expects that the company will continue to seek out opportunities abroad,  augmenting an already diversified stream of cash flow from its U.S. portfolio.   The company recently expanded its international investment base beyond its 28.9%  equity stake in Klepierre SA and ownership interests in international Premium  Outlets, by acquiring interests in five operating properties in the U.K.,  Austria, Italy and the Netherlands through its joint venture with McArthurGlen.   Simon Property Group, L.P.'s Euro-denominated bond offering in October 2013  indicates the company's commitment to match-funding its European investments and  reducing currency risk.  Simon has been equally as opportunistic domestically.  In January 2014, Simon acquired its joint venture partners' remaining interest  in Kravco Simon Investments, a portfolio of 10 assets, including King of Prussia  Mall. Excellent Access to Capital The company has multicurrency credit facilities totaling $6 billion, aggregating  the largest capacity in the U.S. REIT sector.  In addition to the abovementioned  Euro-denominated bond offering, in January 2014 Simon Property Group, L.P.  issued $600 million of 2.20% five-year senior notes and $600 million of 3.75%  10-year senior notes.  During 2013, the company also closed or locked rates on  30 new secured loans totaling approximately $5.1 billion, of which SPG's share  is $3 billion. The weighted average interest rate on the new loans is 3.31% and  the weighted average term is 7.5 years. Strong Liquidity  Liquidity coverage is solid at 1.8x for the period Jan. 1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2015  pro forma.  Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by  liquidity uses.  Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under  revolving credit facilities, and projected retained cash flows from operating  activities pro forma for the repayment of the Sawgrass Mills mortgage, January  2014 unsecured bond offerings, and WPG spinoff.  Liquidity uses include pro  forma debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures and development  expenditures.   If 90% of secured debt maturities through 2015 are refinanced, liquidity  coverage would improve to 2.6x.  In addition, near-term debt maturities are  manageable as approximately 5.7% of pro forma debt matures in 2014 followed by  10.5% in 2015, although 2016 pro forma debt maturities are somewhat heavy at  15.6%.   Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low (AFFO payout ratio, which was 59.2% in  2013.  Fitch calculates that the AFFO payout ratio will increase to 62.6% in  2014 pro forma for the spin-off of WPG, which should still provide strong  internally-generated liquidity of over $1.3 billion per year for future  investments and/or debt repayment. Strong Contingent Liquidity Supports IDR The company also has strong contingent liquidity from its unencumbered pool,  which now includes Sawgrass Mills, one of Simon's stronger assets.  Unencumbered  assets (pro forma Fitch-estimated unencumbered EBITDA divided by a stressed 7%  capitalization rate) covers net unsecured debt by 2.7x, which is adequate for an  'A' rating.  The company's unrestricted cash balance totaled $1.7 billion at  year-end 2013 and Fitch expects a minimum cash balance of approximately $1  billion to fund the business and/or repay corporate unsecured debt. Active Development Pipeline Simon's development pipeline primarily consists of redevelopment projects across  almost all segments including Premium Outlets.  This program should improve  asset quality going forward.  As of Dec. 31, 2013, the pipeline had a pro rata  net cost of approximately $1.3 billion and pro rata cost to complete of $853  million, representing 2.0% of gross assets, which is manageable especially  considering it can be largely funded via retained operating cash flow.  Cost to  complete is still below year-end 2007 levels of 2.3%. Leverage Expected to Decline Pro forma leverage is 5.5x compared with 5.2x in 4Q'2013 (5.6x for full year  2013).  The company reduced leverage from 6.0x in 2012 due to EBITDA growth  along with a build-up of cash via retained cash flow.  Fitch's base case  projects that leverage will approach 5x over the next 12 months and potentially  a high 4x by 2016 due to EBITDA growth, either of which would be appropriate for  the 'A' rating given SPG's improved asset quality.  Under Fitch's stress case,  leverage would remain around 5x, which would be weaker but adequate for an 'A'  rating. Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between Simon's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'A'.  Based on Fitch research titled 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's web site  at 'www.fitchratings.com', these preferred securities are deeply subordinated  and have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in  the event of a corporate default. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's projection of leverage approaching 5.0x and  fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.0x over the near- to medium-term.  The  Stable Outlook further takes into account that the portfolio will remain 'prime'  quality and that qualitative credit strengths will include excellent access to  capital and a strong management team.  The company has sufficient liquidity to  fund its active development pipeline. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (pro forma  fixed-charge coverage was 3.2x in 4Q'2013); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (pro forma leverage is  5.5x though expected to trend just below 5.0x over the next 12-to-24 months). The following factors may have a negative impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x.

",2014-03-12,SPG,"Wed Mar 12, 2014 | 5:39pm EDT",Fitch Upgrades Simon Property Group's IDR to 'A'; Outlook Stable,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-upgrades-simon-property-groups-idr-idUSFit69326520140312?type=companyNews,0.9994,0.05,0.823,0.127
1100,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned 'A' credit ratings to  the $900 million aggregate principal amount 3.375% coupon senior unsecured notes  due 2024 and $400 million aggregate principal amount 4.25% coupon senior  unsecured notes due 2044 issued by Simon Property Group, L.P., the operating  partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG, collectively, Simon).  The 2024 notes were priced at 99.804% of par to yield 3.398% to maturity, or 100  basis points over the benchmark treasury rate and the 2044 notes were priced at  99.409% of par to yield 4.285% to maturity, or 115 basis points over the  benchmark treasury rate. Simon intends to use the net proceeds of the offerings primarily to fund the  redemption of a series of outstanding notes of a subsidiary and the purchase of  any and all of five series of outstanding notes that are validly tendered upon  the terms and subject to the conditions in an offer to purchase dated September  3, 2014, and for general corporate purposes.  Fitch currently rates Simon as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A'; --$75 million preferred stock to 'BBB+'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --IDR 'A'; --$6 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities 'A'; --$240 million unsecured term loan 'A'; --$14 billion senior unsecured notes 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'A' rating takes into account the strong quality of the company's retail  real estate portfolio, fixed-charge coverage appropriate for the 'A' rating  level, and robust pro forma liquidity coverage, driven in part by a low expected  adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio. Credit strengths also  include Simon's excellent access to capital and management track record as a  capital allocator (e.g. via operations, development and capital recycling).  Leverage is somewhat elevated for the 'A' level but expected to decline over the  next 12-to-24 months. Strong Asset Quality On May 28, 2014, Simon completed a spinoff of its strip center business and its  smaller enclosed malls (each of the malls generated annual net operating income  (NOI) of approximately $10 million or less) to Washington Prime Group, Inc.  (NYSE: WPG; Fitch IDR of 'BBB' with a Stable Outlook). Simon's portfolio as of  June 30, 2014 included ownership or interests in 228 properties, comprised on  181 U.S. malls and premium outlets, 13 The Mills properties, 20 international  premium outlets and designer outlets, among other investments. Fitch considers  the portfolio 'prime' as it includes productive assets such as Forum Shops at  Caesars in Las Vegas, NV, The Galleria in Houston, TX, King of Prussia Mall in  King of Prussia, PA, and Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, FL. Simon has consistently  outperformed its U.S. mall peers as measured by occupancy 60 basis points (bps)  above peers and same-store NOI 150 bps above peers from 2006 to 2013, evidencing  'prime' asset quality. Improving Fixed-Charge Coverage The company's same-store NOI growth, driven by mid-single-digit releasing  spreads and occupancy gains, along with a reduced cost of debt capital, improved  fixed-charge coverage to 3.2x for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2014  (3.1x in 2Q'2014) from 2.9x in both 2012 and 2011. Releasing spreads were 20% in  2Q'2014 and 21.1% in 1Q'2014 after averaging 14.9% in 2013 and 10.2% in 2012.  Recently signed rents per square foot relative to average expiring rent per  square foot over the next several years indicate further upward momentum on  releasing spreads.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will remain in the low-to-mid-3x range  over the next 12-to-24 months, which is consistent with an 'A' rating. In a  stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which the company's same-store NOI  growth is consistent with 2009-2010 growth (its weakest reported periods),  fixed-charge coverage would remain in the low 3x range, which would still be  adequate for the 'A' rating. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring  operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities less recurring capital expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments,  divided by total interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  Opportunistic Growth Fitch expects that the company will continue to seek out opportunities abroad,  augmenting an already diversified stream of cash flow from its U.S. portfolio.  Over the past year, Simon expanded its international investment base beyond its  equity stake in Klepierre (28.9% as of June 30, 2014 and 19.3% pro forma for the  merger of Klepierre and Corio announced on July 29, 2014) and ownership  interests in international Premium Outlets, by acquiring interests in five  operating properties in the U.K., Austria, Italy and the Netherlands through its  joint venture with McArthurGlen. Simon Property Group, L.P.'s Euro-denominated  bond offering in October 2013 indicates the company's commitment to  match-funding its European investments and reducing currency risk. Simon has  been opportunistic domestically. In January 2014, Simon acquired its joint  venture partners' remaining interest in Kravco Simon Investments, a portfolio of  10 assets, including King of Prussia Mall. Excellent Access to Capital The company has multicurrency credit facilities totaling $6 billion comprised of  a $4 billion facility and $2 billion supplementary facility, aggregating the  largest capacity in the U.S. REIT sector. In April 2014, the company amended and  extended the $4 billion facility and reduced the rate to LIBOR plus 80 basis  points from LIBOR plus 95 basis points. In addition to the abovementioned Euro  and Dollar denominated bond offerings, over the past year the company also  closed or locked rates on 30 new secured loans totaling approximately $5.1  billion, of which SPG's share is $3 billion. The company also retained $1  billion of cash proceeds from the debt placed on the WPG assets prior to the  spinoff. Adequate Liquidity Liquidity coverage is adequate at 1.2x for the period July 1, 2014 to Dec. 31,  2016 pro forma for the bond offerings and tender offers. Fitch defines liquidity  coverage as liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses. Liquidity sources  include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit facilities, and  projected retained cash flows from operating activities pro forma for the WPG  spinoff. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring  capital expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt  maturities through 2016 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would improve to  1.7x.  Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)  payout ratio, which was 66.4% in 2Q'2014 compared with 59.2% in 2013 and 57% in  2012. Fitch estimates that Simon generates approximately $1.2 billion in  internally-generated liquidity per year, which can be deployed for future  investments, development and/or debt repayment. Strong Contingent Liquidity Supports IDR The company also has strong contingent liquidity from its unencumbered pool.  Unencumbered assets (Fitch-estimated unencumbered EBITDA divided by a stressed  7% capitalization rate) covers unsecured debt by 2.4x, which is adequate for an  'A' rating. The company's unrestricted cash balance totaled $1.7 billion at June  30, 2014 and Fitch expects a minimum cash balance of approximately $1 billion to  fund the business. Unencumbered assets to unsecured debt, net of readily  available cash, is 2.5x as of June 30, 2014.  Active Development Pipeline Simon's development pipeline primarily consists of redevelopment projects across  almost all segments including Premium Outlets. This program should improve asset  quality going forward. As of June 30, 2014, the pipeline had a pro rata net cost  of approximately $1.6 billion and pro rata cost to complete of $1.2 million,  representing 3.1% of gross assets, which is manageable especially considering it  can be largely funded via retained operating cash flow.  Leverage Expected to Decline Leverage as of June 30, 2014 was 5.6x compared with 5.6x for full year 2013. The  company reduced leverage from 6.0x in 2012 due to EBITDA growth along with a  build-up of cash via retained cash flow. Fitch's base case projects that  leverage will approach 5x over the next 12 months and potentially a high 4x by  2016 due to EBITDA growth, either of which would be appropriate for the 'A'  rating given SPG's improved asset quality. Under Fitch's stress case, leverage  would remain around 5x, which would be weaker but adequate for an 'A' rating.  Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between SPG's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis' Criteria Report dated Dec. 23, 2013, as  SPG's preferred securities have cumulative coupon deferral options exercisable  by SPG and thus have readily triggered loss absorption provisions in a going  concern. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's projection of leverage approaching 5.0x and  fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.0x over the near to medium term. The  Stable Outlook further takes into account that the portfolio will remain 'prime'  quality, that the company will have sufficient liquidity to fund its active  development pipeline and that qualitative credit strengths will include  excellent access to capital and a strong management team. On June 19, 2014,  Simon announced that Andrew Juster will become Chief Financial Officer in early  2015, succeeding retiring CFO Stephen Sterrett. Mr. Juster has served as Simon's  Treasurer since 2000. Fitch does not expect a change in Simon's financial  policies as a result of this announcement.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (pro forma  fixed-charge coverage was 3.1x in 2Q'2014); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.6x  though expected to trend just below 5.0x over the next 12-to-24 months). The following factors may have a negative impact on Simon's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3.0x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x.

1103,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a short-term Issuer  Default Rating (IDR) of 'F1' to Simon Property Group, L.P., the operating  partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG or the company).  In  addition, Fitch has assigned short-term ratings of 'F1' to Simon Property Group,  L.P. and Simon CP 2's $500 million commercial paper (CP) note program.  Simon  Property Group, L.P. and Simon CP 2 (together Simon Property Group) are the  issuers of the CP paper, which has a maximum term of 379 days for the U.S. notes  (USCP notes) and 183 days for the Euro notes (ECP notes).  Simon Property Group,  L.P. guarantees the obligations of Simon CP 2.    On Oct. 7, 2014 SPG announced that under its global unsecured CP note program,  Simon Property Group may issue unsecured CP notes denominated in U.S. dollars,  Euros, and other currencies up to a maximum amount of $500 million or the  non-U.S. equivalent.  The CP program has been utilized by both issuers, and the  CP notes rank pari passu with all of the operating partnership's other senior  unsecured indebtedness, all of which is rated 'A' by Fitch.   The time horizon of investment-grade short-term ratings does not explicitly  relate to the 13 months immediately following a given date.  Instead, it relates  to the continual liquidity profile of the rated entity that would be expected to  endure over the time horizon of the long-term IDR. Corporate CP issuers need sufficient liquidity reserves (including liquid  assets, committed bank facilities, or liquidity from a parent or third party) to  withstand two types of liquidity challenges: systemic risk and credit, or event  risk.  Fitch's initial view on the short-term IDR generally considers the  issuer's long-term ratings based on the mapping in the Rating Correspondence  Table in Fitch's 'Short-Term Ratings Criteria for Non-Financial Corporates,'  dated Aug. 5, 2013.  In this table, a long-term IDR of 'A' corresponds with a  short-term IDR of 'F1'. The global unsecured CP note program is a credit positive in that it establishes  another source of unsecured debt capital -- albeit not a committed long-term  source -- for the company and may allow for borrowing arbitrage opportunities.  As of June 30, 2014, the company's $4 billion credit facility, which has an  initial maturity of June 30, 2018, bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.8%.  The company's $2 billion supplemental credit facility, which has an initial  maturity of June 30, 2016, bears an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.95%.  Conversely, recent U.S. CP rates for comparably rated issuers are 0.21% for 3  months and 0.24% for nine months and Euro CP rates for comparably rated issuers  range from 0.22% (three months) to 0.52% (nine months).  KEY RATING DRIVERS SPG's long-term IDR of 'A' takes into account the strong quality of the  company's retail real estate portfolio, fixed charge coverage appropriate for  the 'A' rating level, and robust pro forma liquidity coverage, driven in part by  a low expected adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio. Credit  strengths also include SPG's excellent access to capital and management track  record as a capital allocator (e.g. via operations, development and capital  recycling). Leverage is somewhat elevated for the 'A' level but expected to  decline over the next 12-to-24 months.  Strong Asset Quality On May 28, 2014, SPG completed a spinoff of its strip center business and its  smaller enclosed malls (each of the malls generated annual net operating income   of approximately $10 million or less) to Washington Prime Group, Inc.  (NYSE: WPG; Fitch IDR of 'BBB-'; Stable Outlook). SPG's portfolio as of June 30,  2014 included ownership or interests in 228 properties, consisting of 181 U.S.  malls and premium outlets, 13 The Mills properties, and 20 international premium  outlets and designer outlets, among other investments. Fitch considers the  portfolio 'prime' as it includes productive assets such as Forum Shops at  Caesars in Las Vegas, NV, The Galleria in Houston, TX, King of Prussia Mall in  King of Prussia, PA, and Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, FL. SPG has consistently  outperformed its U.S. mall peers as measured by occupancy 60 basis points (bps)  above peers and same-store NOI 150 bps above peers from 2006 to 2013, evidencing  'prime' asset quality.  Improving Fixed-Charge Coverage The company's same-store NOI growth, driven by mid-single-digit releasing  spreads and occupancy gains, along with a reduced cost of debt capital, improved  fixed-charge coverage to 3.2x for the trailing 12 months ended June 30, 2014  (3.1x in 2Q'14) from 2.9x in both 2012 and 2011. Releasing spreads were 20% in  2Q'14 and 21.1% in 1Q'14 after averaging 14.9% in 2013 and 10.2% in 2012.  Recently signed rents per square foot relative to average expiring rent per  square foot over the next several years indicate further upward momentum on  releasing spreads.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will remain in the low- to mid-3x  range over the next 12-to-24 months, which is consistent with an 'A' rating. In  a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which the company's same-store NOI  growth is consistent with 2009-2010 growth (its weakest reported periods),  fixed-charge coverage would remain in the low 3x range, which would still be  adequate for the 'A' rating. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring  operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities less recurring capital expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments,  divided by total interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  Opportunistic Growth Fitch expects that the company will continue to seek out opportunities abroad,  augmenting an already diversified stream of cash flow from its U.S. portfolio.  Over the past year, Simon expanded its international investment base beyond its  equity stake in Klepierre (28.9% as of June 30, 2014 and 19.3% pro forma for the  merger of Klepierre and Corio announced on July 29, 2014) and ownership  interests in international Premium Outlets, by acquiring interests in five  operating properties in the U.K., Austria, Italy and the Netherlands through its  joint venture with McArthurGlen. Simon Property Group, L.P.'s Euro-denominated  bond offering in October 2013 indicates the company's commitment to  match-funding its European investments and reducing currency risk.  SPG has been opportunistic domestically. In January 2014, the company acquired  its joint venture partners' remaining interest in Kravco Simon Investments, a  portfolio of 10 assets, including King of Prussia Mall.  Excellent Access to Capital In addition to the newly established CP program, the company has multicurrency  credit facilities totaling $6 billion comprising a $4 billion facility and $2  billion supplementary facility, aggregating the largest capacity in the U.S.  REIT sector. In April 2014, the company amended and extended the $4 billion  facility and reduced the rate to LIBOR plus 80 bps from LIBOR plus 95 bps. In  addition to the abovementioned Euro and U.S. dollar denominated bond offerings,  over the past year the company also closed or locked rates on 30 new secured  loans totaling approximately $5.1 billion, of which SPG's share is $3 billion.  The company also retained $1 billion of cash proceeds from the debt placed on  the WPG assets prior to the spinoff. Adequate Liquidity Liquidity coverage is adequate at 1.2x for the period July 1, 2014 to Dec. 31,  2016 pro forma both bond offerings and tender offers completed in September.  Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses.  Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit  facilities, and projected retained cash flows from operating activities pro  forma for the WPG spinoff. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities,  projected recurring capital expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of  secured debt maturities through 2016 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would  improve to 1.7x. Liquidity is enhanced by SPG's low AFFO payout ratio, which was 66.4% in 2Q'14  compared with 59.2% in 2013 and 57% in 2012. Fitch estimates that the company  generates approximately $1.2 billion in internally generated liquidity per year,  which can be deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Strong Contingent Liquidity Supports IDR The company also has strong contingent liquidity from its unencumbered pool.  Unencumbered assets (Fitch-estimated unencumbered EBITDA divided by a stressed  7% capitalization rate) covers unsecured debt by 2.4x, which is adequate for an  'A' rating. The company's unrestricted cash balance totaled $1.7 billion at June  30, 2014 and Fitch expects a minimum cash balance of approximately billion to  fund the business. Unencumbered assets-to-unsecured debt, net of readily  available cash, was 2.5x as of June 30, 2014. Active Development Pipeline SPG's development pipeline primarily consists of redevelopment projects across  almost segments including Premium Outlets. This program should improve asset  quality going forward. As of June 30, 2014, the pipeline had a pro rata net cost  of approximately $1.6 billion and projected cost to complete of $1.2 million,  representing 3.1% of gross assets, which is manageable especially considering it  can be largely funded via retained operating cash flow. Leverage Expected to Decline Leverage (net debt as of June 30, 2014 divided by TTM recurring operating  EBITDA) was 5.1x compared with 5.6x for full-year 2013. The company reduced  leverage from 6x in 2012 due to EBITDA growth along with a build-up of cash via  retained flow. Fitch's base case projects that leverage will remain around 5x  over the next 12 months and could decline below 5x by 2016 due to EBITDA growth,  either of which would be appropriate for the 'A' rating given SPG's improved  asset quality. Under Fitch's stress case, leverage would increase to between 5x  and 5.5x, which would be weaker but adequate for an 'A' rating. Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between SPG's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis' criteria report dated Dec. 23, 2013, as  SPG's preferred securities have cumulative coupon deferral options exercisable  by SPG and thus have readily triggered loss absorption provisions in a going  concern.  Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's projection of leverage approaching 5x and  fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3x over the near- to medium-term. The  Stable Outlook further takes into account that the portfolio will remain 'prime'  quality, that the company will have sufficient liquidity to fund its active  development pipeline and that qualitative credit strengths will include  excellent access to capital and a strong management team. On June 19, 2014, SPG  announced that Andrew Juster would become Chief Financial Officer in early 2015,  succeeding retiring CFO Stephen Sterrett. Mr. Juster has served as Simon's  Treasurer since 2000. Fitch does not expect a change in the company's financial  policies as a result of this announcement. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (pro forma  fixed-charge coverage was 3.1x in 2Q'14); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.1x at  June 30, 2014). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x. Fitch currently rates the company as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Long-term IDR 'A'; --$75 million preferred stock 'BBB+'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --Long-term IDR 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --$6 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities 'A'; --$240 million unsecured term loan 'A'; --$14 billion senior unsecured notes 'A'; --CP notes 'F1'.

1104,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Nov 12 Sears Holding Corp  made a huge splash last week when it said it might spin off hundreds of its stores as a real estate investment trust. But the struggling retailer's move to tap into a surging commercial property market comes as the sector looks increasingly rich.The temptation is understandable. REITs, those formed around retail properties in particular, have been one of the post-financial crisis stars. The reason: juicy dividends. And, of course, six years of low-interest rate policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve, which have pushed bond yields to historic lows.The S&P 1500 Retail REIT industry group, which includes the likes of mall and shopping plaza owners Simon Property Group Inc., Macerich Co. and National Retail Properties Inc., delivered a total return of nearly 500 percent since March 2009. That's more than double the return of the wider stock market.This year alone, the benchmark MSCI U.S. REIT index has surged 26 percent compared with 10 percent for the S&P 500.Yet, just as Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert considers diving into this game, fund managers and analysts in the sector worry that the best days for publicly traded REITs are now behind them because they are too expensive.""We're turning over rocks for opportunities, but it's clear that REITs are not cheap,"" said Joel Beam, manager of the Forward Income Opportunity fund.Beam is not alone. The average equity income fund now holds 7.8 percent of its portfolio in REITs, according to Lipper, the same percentage as in 2009. FED THREAT A top risk for the group is the Fed, which is widely expected to start raising interest rates next year for the first time since the recession.Investors have been drawn into REITs by dividend yields that now average 3.5 percent, more than a full percentage point above the yield on safer assets such as the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note and roughly a half-point higher than the yield on investment grade corporate bonds.As such, shares of REITs are highly sensitive to any hint that interest rates could rise, a prospect that would make bonds more attractive by comparison. In 2013, for instance, the S&P 1500 Retail REIT industry group fell 21 percent during the three months of the so-called ""Taper Tantrum,"" which erupted following hints by the Fed that it would end its bond-buying stimulus program - and pivot toward a tighter monetary policy.REITs have since recovered to record highs. But analysts say that rich valuations, at a time when the expanding U.S. economy should send interest rates higher, mean that another significant drop could be in the making.The group is also substantially more levered than most other stocks. The average long-term debt-to-equity multiple among the 22 members of the S&P retail REIT industry group is 143.2 compared with just 94.7 for the S&P 500 as a whole.Higher interest rates mean higher borrowing costs for new or refinanced debt, a factor that will further impede profit growth. To be sure, some analysts say that certain REITs could do well, even in a rising interest rate environment - largely because they could pass on  costs to their tenants in the form of rising rents.A lack of new supply in the REIT market, as well as concerns that the European Union economy is in recession, should keep a floor on any price declines if rates were to rise, said Alexander Goldfarb, a senior REIT analyst at Sandler O'Neill.PRICEY But even Goldfarb sees valuations stretched for several of the companies he covers.Added Todd Lukasik, a Morningstar analyst: ""REITs look to be on average about 10 percent over-valued...what we've seen recently is that on days when you have a big movement upward in the yield of the 10 year Treasury, you get a pretty noticeable decline in REIT stock prices.""Income fund managers, too, say that they are put off by high valuations in the sector.REITs now trade at an average of 23 times cash flow, Beam, the Forward fund manager said, compared with their historical average of 16 times. Should interest rates rise, he added, it will be ""a little bit scary.""        (Reporting by David Randall.

1105,"  * Magnus Peterson found guilty on eight counts* Could be jailed for up to 10 years; sentencing on Jan. 23* Investors lost $536 million   (Adds quotes, background, detail)By Kirstin Ridley and Nishant KumarLONDON, Jan 19 The boss of collapsed UK hedge fund Weavering could be jailed for up to 10 years after being found guilty of fraud by a London court on Monday, giving Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) one of its most senior financial scalps since the credit crunch.Magnus Peterson, 51, was found guilty of eight counts of fraud, forgery, false accounting and fraudulent trading and was acquitted on seven other charges after a 12-week trial that delved into the complex world of hedge fund investing. The fraud cost investors $536 million.""Whilst Mr Peterson knew full well what the true value of the fund was when it collapsed, his investors did not. To them, the extensive losses they suffered came as a complete shock,"" the SFO said in a statement.Peterson has been remanded in custody and will be sentenced on Jan. 23, the SFO said. Swedish-born Peterson, a charismatic former interest rate and foreign exchange trader, pitched his flagship fund to institutions and wealthy individuals as a low-risk investment offering stable returns.But he was found guilty of covering up rising trading losses by weaving a web of deception that unravelled in March 2009, six months after the bankruptcy of Wall Street's Lehman Brothers sent panic through global markets and prompted investors to clamour for redemptions. Weavering could not pay up.The SFO, which investigated trades between the Weavering Macro Fund and Weavering Capital Fund (WCF), an offshore company owned by Peterson, said the fund manager artificially inflated his fund's investment performance and misled investors into putting $780 million into the Macro Fund over a six-year period.He was found not guilty of one count of fraudulent trading and six counts of fraud by false representation. ""The verdicts returned by the jury clearly show that they rejected much of the SFO's case, but we will need to consider the position very carefully,"" said Matthew Frankland, Peterson's lawyer. ""Regrettably, winning much of the case is of no comfort to Mr Peterson in all the circumstances.""SHAM TRADES  The SFO said the fund failed because its net asset value had been grossly inflated by sham over-the-counter interest rate swaps with WCF.However, British Virgin Islands-based WCF really only existed on paper, prosecutors said. It had small stakes in ventures such as a failed stage musical. By 2003 it had no external investors, no administrator and no auditors.When the Macro fund collapsed, the bulk of its assets were found to be $600 million of interest rate swaps with WCF as the counterparty, alongside $260 million of unpaid redemptions.Prosecutors said the swaps were designed solely to flatter the Macro fund's paper accounts, allowing it to attract more investors and Peterson to pay himself millions in performance fees. The swaps, however, were worthless.Peterson paid himself 5.8 million pounds ($8.8 million) between 2005 and 2009, the SFO statement said.The Weavering business was a family affair. Peterson's wife Amanda was a director of Mayfair-based Weavering Capital UK (WCUK), which acted as investment adviser to WCF and the Macro fund. His stepfather and brother were Weavering Macro Fund directors.Peterson's conviction is a welcome victory for the SFO, which was lambasted for dropping its investigation in 2011, citing no reasonable prospect of conviction. The case was re-opened under new head David Green shortly after liquidators won a civil suit against Peterson.

1106,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 09 (Fitch) The proposal by Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:  SPG) to acquire The Macerich Company (NYSE: MAC, Macerich) for $91.00 per share  in cash and SPG shares, if consummated as proposed, would likely have negative  credit implications for SPG according to Fitch Ratings.  The proposed  transaction would increase SPG's leverage materially above the 5.1x level as of  Dec. 31, 2014 while also lowering the company's unencumbered asset coverage of  unsecured debt.  If an agreement is reached, Fitch would review revised  transaction terms, if any, and the company's ratings and Outlook.  Currently,  the company's long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is 'A' with a Stable  Outlook.   PROPOSED TRANSACTION  On March 9, 2015, SPG announced a proposed transaction to acquire MAC for  approximately $22.4 billion, including the assumption of MAC's approximately  $6.4 billion of debt outstanding, including MAC's pro rata share of mortgage  debt from unconsolidated entities.  SPG also reached an agreement in principle  to sell certain Macerich assets to General Growth Properties, Inc. (NYSE: GGP,  Not Rated) in connection with the closing of the acquisition. The GGP sale would  not be a condition to closing the transaction.  The proposed agreement between  SPG and GGP removes a potential bidder for MAC, thereby increasing the  probability of SPG winning MAC. However, hostile public-to-public REIT  transactions oftentimes pose challenges to the bidder by the target.  POTENTIAL CREDIT IMPLICATIONS Credit concerns inherent in the proposed transaction include a weakening of the  balance sheet as measured by net debt-to-EBITDA. Fitch's expectation of leverage  sustaining above 5.5x would be one factor inconsistent with the 'A' IDR.   Moreover, the company's unencumbered assets (based on a stressed 7%  capitalization rate) to net unsecured debt ratio of 2.6x would weaken if the MAC  transaction closes as proposed.  If consummated, Fitch anticipates that SPG  would maintain adequate liquidity and excellent access to capital. The company's  liquidity coverage ratio is 1.4x for the period Jan. 31, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016,  driven by an industry-leading revolving credit facility capacity, which will  enable the company to fund upcoming debt maturities and capital expenditures,  along with $1.3 billion of expected development costs.  Moreover, SPG's adjusted  funds from operations payout ratio was 64% during 2014; based on the current  payout ratio, the company retains over $1 billion annually in organic cash flow.  Credit positives inherent in the proposed transaction include the potential to  acquire a high-quality mall portfolio as measured by MAC's strong sales per  square foot and occupancy ratios.  Nevertheless, SPG has outperformed MAC on  both measures, with SPG's sales per square foot at $619 as of Dec. 31, 2014  compared with $587 - both high levels compared to the mall industry at large.   SPG's occupancy in its U.S. malls and Premium Outlets was 97.1% as of Dec. 31,  2014 compared with MAC at 95.8%.   SPG's average same-store net operating income (NOI) has outperformed MAC by 110  basis points from 2008-2014, which speaks to Simon's stronger property level  performance, while SPG also has materially lower general and administrative  costs as a percentage of total revenues when compared with MAC.  Therefore, SPG  has the potential to drive above-average cash flow growth if the MAC transaction  is consummated.  In addition, the proposed transaction would increase SPG's  exposure to strong demographic regions in California (29% of MAC's expected 2015  pro rata NOI), New York (18.3%) and Arizona (17%). RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A highly leveraged transaction that materially weakens the company's credit  profile; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x; --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x. The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (this ratio  was 3.7x in 2014); --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.1x at  Dec. 31, 2014). Fitch currently rates the companies as follows: Simon Property Group, Inc. --Long-term IDR 'A'; --$75 million preferred stock 'BBB+'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --Long-term IDR 'A'; --Short-term IDR 'F1'; --$6.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities 'A'; --$240 million unsecured term loan 'A'; --$13.4 billion senior unsecured notes 'A'; --$409 million commercial paper notes 'F1'.

Including debt, the offer was valued at $22.4 billion. ""Macerich's rejection is based on a rosy view of its future prospects,"" Simon Property Chief Executive David Simon said in a statement, calling the rejection an ""extreme, scorched-earth response"".Macerich's directors will now be divided into three classes and their term will be three years, the company said, adding that it would review this structure in 2016.Macerich is incorporated in Maryland, which allows a company's board to take steps to ward off a hostile takeover without having to seek shareholder approval. The company said it rejected the offer partly due to antitrust concerns and its inability to evaluate Simon Property's ""claims regarding its margins.""""Simon's next step is likely to be to raise its offer,"" Cowen & Company analyst James Sullivan wrote in a note.Macerich has been selling off underperforming malls to focus on redeveloping its more lucrative malls. It plans to spend $400 million-$500 million annually on such actions over the next five years.The deal would have helped Simon Property boost its portfolio of high-end malls, which are performing better than those with mid-range brands, and expand in California and other western states. High-end malls generally house expensive brands such as Apple Inc and Macy Inc's Bloomingdale's.Macerich said its rights plan, which came into effect immediately, would expire on the date of its 2016 annual investor meeting.Shareholders of record as on March 30 will have the right to buy one preferred share for each common share held.Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Goldman Sachs & Co and JP Morgan Securities LLC are Macerich's financial advisers, while Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Goodwin Procter LLP and Venable LLP are its legal advisers.Macerich's shares closed down 3.5 percent at $91.60 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Simon Property fell 0.5 percent to $186.13.(Additional reporting by Rohit T.K. and Eileen Soreng in Bengaluru; Editing by Kirti Pandey)",2015-03-17,SPG,"Tue Mar 17, 2015 | 4:30pm EDT","UPDATE 4-Macerich rejects Simon Property offer, adopts poison pill",http://www.reuters.com//article/macerich-ma-simon-prop-grp-idUSL3N0WJ49220150317?type=companyNews,-0.3954,0.069,0.856,0.075

Staggered boards are also considered a powerful anti-takeover defense.With Macerich's moves, management has greater control over the real estate investment trust, making it tough for Simon Property to force a resolution, analysts say.""Unless Macerich wants to do a deal, there won't be a deal,"" said Alexander Goldfarb, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill + Partners LP in New York. Historically, hostile takeovers of REITs are very difficult, he said.Macerich's stock price suggests traders expect a sweetened bid. Shares hit a high of $94.18 on Thursday, up 3.5 percent from the offer price of $91 a share. The stock has climbed 35 percent since the day before Nov. 19, when Simon Property announced it had accumulated a 3.6 percent stake in Macerich. The governance changes Macerich implemented this week aim to give it more breathing room when it comes to assessing its options, the company's board said on Tuesday.The anti-takeover measures are not as unfriendly to shareholders as they may seem, Todd Thomas, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in a note, adding that the company could hold out for a higher offer.Simon Property's chairman and chief executive, David Simon,  is considered a savvy foe. Investors give Simon credit for being disciplined in pursuing acquisitions that make sense, while dropping a deal that is not valuable, said Paul Adornato, senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York. For example, Simon Property withdrew a $4.5 billion offer for the UK's Capital Shopping Centers in 2011 when the company refused to share information.""David Simon has shown discipline over the years in walking away when either the numbers don't make sense or the deal is dead,"" Adornato said.Sandler O'Neill's Goldfarb said Simon Property's offer of $91 a share is ""pretty healthy,"" though he recognized it could go higher. ""Obviously people don't lead with their 'best-and-final,' but the number that they've put out on our valuation is close to our forecast,"" Goldfarb said.If Simon Property's offer were to rise to $115 a share, it would drive a real estate measure known as the ""cap rate"" down to 4.0 percent, a high price but not too high, Adornato said. A cap rate is determined by dividing a property's net operating income with an asset's price. Falling cap rates indicate rising values. ""While that might seem excessive, one has to keep in mind there's a lot of growth that's not yet in Macerich's numbers,"" Adornato said, referring to Macerich's acquisition of New York properties Kings Plaza in Brooklyn and Green Acres on Long Island, where a turnaround strategy has just begun.

1121,"   By Herbert Lash | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Simon Property Group Inc's (SPG.N) failed bid to buy U.S. upscale shopping center operator Macerich Co (MAC.N) is unlikely to crush either company's stock price for a simple reason: No one is building any more ""Class A"" malls.Macerich late on Tuesday rejected Simon's sweetened cash-and-stock offer, which was valued at $95.50 a share, or $23.2 billion including debt. Macerich Chief Executive Officer Arthur Coppola said in a statement that the revised bid did not reflect the full value of the company, the third-largest U.S. real estate investment trust. Analysts suggested Coppola had a point because upscale malls such as Macerich's Tysons Corner Center in northern Virginia are unique assets that cannot be built as easily as hotels, apartment or office buildings.Simon's bid and Macerich's rejection underpin the value of Class A malls, said Cowen and Co analyst James Sullivan. ""They only get sold when a seller chooses to sell them,"" he said. ""Mall development just isn't happening today. That makes the ones that are in place increasingly valuable."" The uniqueness of upscale malls gives them ""fortress-like"" characteristics, as Sullivan and other REIT analysts point out. ""As we say in the real estate business, malls are not fungible,"" Sullivan said. ""You can't just turn around and build another one in the same market.""The only U.S. regional mall under construction is the International Market Place in Hawaii, a property controlled by Taubman Centers Inc (TCO.N).Macerich shares were down 5.9 percent at $79.34 in afternoon trading, while Simon rose 1.3 percent to $198.24.  MALLS VS. SHARES Upscale mall valuations are generally the highest in the real estate industry, but their operators' shares still trade at a discount to the individual assets, Sullivan said.General Growth Properties Inc (GGP.N), the second-largest U.S. REIT behind Simon, sold a stake in its Ala Moana shopping center in Hawaii to Australian pension fund AustralianSuper in March at a 3.7 cap rate, Sullivan said.A cap rate is the net operating income of a property divided by its price. The lower this measure is, the higher the asset's price.  While Sullivan said Ala Moana was an exceptional asset, its cap rate suggested the better mall REITs have lower values than what their assets are selling for in the private market.To reflect a 4.0 cap rate, Macerich shares would have to rise to $115 from about $80 today, according to BMO Capital Markets analyst Paul Adornato. He said in an interview two weeks ago that Simon's first bid of $91 a share on March 9 equated to a 4.8 cap rate.Sandler O'Neil + Partners analyst Alex Goldfarb said Simon CEO David Simon would not let Macerich's rejection of his bid discourage him. The company has bid for and was rejected by Taubman Centers and General Growth in the past.Sandler O'Neil said it expected to receive or intended to seek compensation from both Macerich and Simon for investment banking services in the next three months. ""David is extremely shrewd and has run an incredible company,"" Goldfarb said. ""They'll certainly find other investment opportunities.""

1130,"   By Herbert Lash | NEW YORK  NEW YORK With Sears Holdings Corp's second joint venture announcement this month on Monday, one question left to be answered is how much of the struggling mall anchor's property will be devoted to new, and potentially lucrative, retail space.Sears and Simon Property Group Inc said they would form a 50-50 joint venture to boost the value of 10 Sears properties at Simon-managed malls, similar to its April 1 announcement with mall operator General Growth Properties.As part of the agreement, up to half of the space Sears sold will be available for redevelopment for new tenants who will pay higher rents. The deal is part of the retailer's effort to get value out of its extensive land holdings.

""Sears can work with these partners, with the mall landlords, to come up with a better use for their space.""

The option to redevelop parts of the Sears footprint in the malls was a major driver of why General Growth and Simon Property agreed to the joint ventures, Busch said. Sears does not need as much space as it has and it can capitalize on  releasing space, he said. The Sears properties sold in the joint ventures is considered A Class because of their location, the quality of tenants and little, if any, vacancy.

1132,"   By Mike Stone  Macerich Co's (MAC.N) fourth largest shareholder, Cohen & Steers Inc (CNS.N), asked the shopping mall company on Wednesday to produce a plan that will deliver as much value as the takeover offer by Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) it turned down last month.The comments, made by Cohen & Steers' Executive Chairman Martin Cohen to Reuters on the sidelines of the NYU REIT Symposium in New York, make the investment manager the largest Macerich shareholder to publicly criticize the company after it rejected a sweetened offer of $95.50 per share by Simon, equivalent to $23.2 billion including debt.""At least give us a plan of how Macerich will exceed Simon's offer over time,"" Cohen said, adding that he favored Simon's offer.A Macerich spokesman declined to comment. Cohen & Steers owns 6.35 percent of Macerich's common stock, according to Thomson Reuters data. It is one of the biggest investors in real estate investment trusts and is also a shareholder in Simon, as well as other major real estate companies such as Equity Residential (EQR.N), Vornado Realty Trust (VNO.N) and SL Green Realty Corp (SLG.N).Smaller Macerich investor, Land and Buildings Investment Management LLC, headed by activist investor Jonathan Litt, is also currently challenging Macerich with a proposal for a slate of four directors to its board. Macerich is seeking to quash Land & Buildings nominations in court, according to court documents reviewed by Reuters. Macerich's complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City states Land and Buildings was not a shareholder by March 20, the date of record when shareholders can vote in upcoming board member elections and make nominations.A merger between Indianapolis-based Simon and Santa Monica, California-based Macerich would have joined the No. 1 and No. 3 U.S. shopping mall owners. Simon argued the deal would boost their ability to negotiate leases with store owners at a time when mall operators are experiencing a fall in traffic as consumers take to shopping online, which is more convenient and often cheaper. Macerich countered that Simon's offer ""substantially"" undervalued it. It adopted a poison pill, or a shareholder rights plan, with a 10 percent trigger, and changed its board structure to thwart a hostile takeover.

1133,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, April 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed its ratings on Simon  Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG) and certain rated subsidiaries (collectively,  Simon), including SPG's long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this  release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's affirmation of Simon's long-term IDR at 'A' reflects the strong quality  of the company's retail real estate portfolio that generates robust cash flow in  excess of fixed charges, as well as the company's significant scale and  market-leading access to capital. Other credit strengths include SPG's good  liquidity and financial flexibility, featuring a low AFFO payout ratio and  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt. The biggest wildcard for bondholders over the next two years relates to whether  Simon's recently established $2 billion common stock repurchase program and its  bid for The Macerich Company (NYSE: MAC) reflect a more shareholder-friendly  capital allocation policy. The program, combined with the unsuccessful bid for  MAC, would have increased leverage by approximately a turn. However, the company  has reiterated a commitment to maintaining its existing ratings. Moreover, Simon  withdrew its bid for MAC and Fitch expects the company to repurchase a moderate  amount of common stock over the next two years.  Appropriate Leverage; Share Repurchase Program a Wildcard Fitch calculates Simon's leverage at 5.2x as of Dec. 31, 2014 pro forma for the  cash acquisitions of Jersey Gardens in Elizabeth, New Jersey and University Park  Village in Fort Worth, Texas in January 2015. Fitch expects leverage to be in  the 5.0x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24 months but closer to 5.5x this year,  following the stabilization of development and re-development projects. Leverage  sustaining between 4.5x and 5.5x is appropriate for the 'A' rating, thus Fitch's  projections are towards the high-end of the range.  Should the company aggressively utilize its common stock repurchase program,  which is not Fitch's expectation, leverage would trend in the 5.5x-6.0x range,  which would be weak for the 'A' rating. Fitch defines leverage as debt less  readily available cash to recurring operating EBITDA including recurring cash  distributions from unconsolidated entities, which include dividends from  Klepierre.  Strong Asset Quality As of Dec. 31, 2014, Simon owned or had an interest in 228 properties comprising  189 million square feet in North America, Asia and Europe. Additionally, pro  forma for Klepierre SA's acquisition of Corio N.V., the company had an 18.3%  equity interest in Klepierre, a Paris-based shopping center company, and also  has an interest in a joint venture with McArthurGlen Group formed to own and  develop designer outlets primarily in Europe.  Simon has consistently outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable  NOI growth exceeding peers by an average of 240 basis points from 2005-2014 and  occupancy outperforming peers by 150 basis points from 2005-2014, demonstrating  strong asset quality. Simon's 4Q2014 sales PSF was $619 ($631 for Simon's 109  malls), the second highest among the company's U.S. peers, trailing only Taubman  Centers, Inc. (unrated by Fitch) at $809.  Fitch considers SPG's portfolio as 'prime' as it includes productive assets such  as Forum Shops at Caesars in Las Vegas, NV, The Galleria in Houston, TX, King of  Prussia Mall in King of Prussia, PA, and Sawgrass Mills in Sunrise, FL. The  portfolio has scale and diversity, ranging from Premium Outlets to luxury malls.  Robust Fixed-Charge Coverage Simon's pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio is 3.9x, compared with 3.7x in  2014 and 3.3x in 2013. Mid-single-digit releasing spreads and occupancy gains  drove SPG's same-store NOI growth of 5.1% on comparable malls and Premium  Outlets in 2014. Releasing spreads for malls and Premium Outlets were 16.6% in  2014 compared with 18.2% in 2013 and 10.8% in 2012. This same-store NOI growth  and a reduced cost of debt capital improved fixed-charge coverage. Recently  signed rents per square foot relative to upcoming average expiring rent per  square foot indicate that strong re-leasing spreads are achievable for the next  several years. Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will be in low 4.0x range over the  next 12-to-24 months, which is strong for the 'A' rating. Fitch defines  fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA including recurring cash  distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring capital expenditures  and straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total interest incurred and  preferred stock dividends. Lower Relative Overhead & Potential Operating Synergies Simon's general and administrative expenses as a percentage of recurring  operating EBITDA was 4.1% in 2014, indicative of its significant scale as the  largest publicly traded REIT. The company's equity market capitalization and  total market capitalization excluding limited partnership units were $56.6  billion and $83.7 billion, respectively, as of Dec. 31, 2014 ($66.3 billion and  $93.4 billion, respectively, including limited partnership units). Lower general  and administrative expenses and moderately lower capital costs (primarily via  unsecured bond and bank borrowings) have historically comprised the few scale  advantages available to REITs generally. Outside of the mall sector, not many  REIT property types have been able to generate meaningful property level savings  and/or operating synergies through increased scale. Market Leading Access to Capital In addition to a commercial paper (CP) program established in 2014--the first  such program established by a U.S. equity REIT?and upsized to $1 billion from  $500 million in March 2015, the company has two multicurrency credit facilities  totaling $6.75 billion. The credit facilities are comprised of a $4 billion  facility and $2.75 billion supplementary facility (upsized from $2 billion in  March 2015), aggregating the largest capacity in the U.S. REIT sector.  Simon was active in both the unsecured and secured debt markets in 2014. It  retired $2.9 billion of senior notes at a weighted average coupon rate of 5.76%  and completed two senior notes offerings totaling $2.5 billion, with a weighted  average coupon rate of 3.32%. Simon also closed 16 new secured loans during 2014  totaling approximately $2.8 billion, of which SPG's share is $1.6 billion. The  weighted average interest rate on these loans is 3.29% and the weighted average  term is 8.4 years. Good Liquidity and Financial Flexibility Liquidity coverage is good at 1.3x for the period Jan. 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016  pro forma. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by  liquidity uses. Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under  revolving credit facilities pro forma for first quarter 2015 acquisitions, and  projected retained cash flows from operating activities. Liquidity uses include  pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures and  development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt maturities through 2016 are  refinanced, liquidity coverage would improve to 2.2x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)  payout ratio, which was 64% in 2014 compared with 59.2% in 2013 and 57% in 2012.  Fitch estimates that the company generates approximately $1.5 billion of  internally generated liquidity per year, which can be deployed for future  investments, development and/or debt repayment. Fitch view's SPG's unencumbered pool as strong on an absolute basis given the  pool's size ($2.6 billion of EBITDA in 2014) and quality. Unencumbered assets  (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) covers net unsecured debt by 2.7x,  which is adequate for the rating. Fitch estimates that the unencumbered  portfolio is levered 5.6x as compared to the encumbered portfolio at 5.4x on a  gross basis and also excluding recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities, thus the unencumbered pool is slightly more levered than the  encumbered pool.  Active Development Pipeline Simon's development pipeline primarily consists of redevelopment projects across  almost all segments including Premium Outlets. This program should improve asset  quality going forward. As of Dec. 31, 2014, the pipeline had a pro rata net cost  of approximately $1.3 billion, representing 3.4% of gross assets, exceeding the  2.3% level reached at year-end 2007. However, redevelopment is a significantly  larger component of development expenditures today than it was then at 84%  compared to 37%. Redevelopments are lower risk due to smaller scale and  demonstrated leasing activity and sales history. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Simon in Fitch's base case include: --4% same-store NOI growth and 3%-3.5% same-store NOI growth in 2016-2017; --G&A growth to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues; --$1-$1.5 billion in annual development funded predominately with retained cash  flow, generating 9% stabilized yields; --Stock repurchases of less than $500 million over the next two years; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds and secured debt; --AFFO payout ratio of approximately 60%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.2x pro  forma for the acquisitions of Jersey Gardens and University Park Village). --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (this ratio  is 3.9x pro forma). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A deviation from SPG's public commitment to maintaining existing ratings  and/or any other actions that may result in a deterioration in the company's  market-leading access to capital on an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x. Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Simon Property Group, Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --$75 million preferred stock at 'BBB+'. Simon Property Group, L.P. --Long-term IDR at 'A'; --Short-term IDR at 'F1'; --$6.75 billion unsecured revolving credit facilities at 'A'; --$240 million unsecured term loan at 'A'; --$13.4 billion senior unsecured notes at 'A'; --$409.2 million commercial paper notes at 'F1'. Simon CP 2 --$409.2 million commercial paper notes at 'F1'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

1134,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Even as the rise of online retailers such as Amazon.com Inc leads analysts to predict the eventual death of the American shopping mall, real estate fund managers are betting some will prosper – if they can lure the right kind of consumer.Simon Property Group Inc, the largest high-end mall operator in the country with properties including Palo Alto, California's Stanford Shopping Center and suburban Philadelphia's King of Prussia Mall is the top holding in 53 of the 71 U.S. real estate funds tracked by Lipper. The average real estate fund devotes 8.8 percent of its portfolio to Simon, a bigger average bet than the 7.6 percent that tech funds invest in Apple Inc and almost one percentage point more than the weight of Simon in the benchmark S&P U.S. REIT index.Still a symbol of a car-based, middle-class suburban America, malls are increasingly seen as viable only if they attract the affluent. Fund managers are bullish on so-called Class A malls, anchored by department stores like Bloomingdale’s and featuring retailers like Apple, reflecting how better-off consumers have thrived since the end of the financial crisis while middle and lower income consumers have struggled. ""Class A malls are repositioning themselves to be destinations, with more restaurants, which is making them more resilient to what's going on with the Internet,"" said Rick Romano, a portfolio manager of the $3.8 billion Prudential Global Real Estate fund, who holds 4.5 percent of his portfolio in Simon, his top holding.Class A malls are also the only shopping centers able to attract an Apple store, which can post annual sales of more than $5,000 a square foot - the highest of any U.S. retailer - and boost sales growth for other retailers throughout the mall, Romano said. As a result, Simon has been able to post rent increases of 18.9 percent for new leases over the last 12 months, according to Paul Morgan, an analyst at MLV & Co.Simon's average rent per square foot – which includes ongoing and new leases – rose 4.5 percent in the first quarter compared with the year before, or about six times the 0.8 percent pace of inflation in the U.S. Bloomingdale's is the most frequent anchor store at the highest-rated malls in the country, followed by Nordstrom.Those Americans in the top 20 percent of income – or Class A mall shoppers – have seen their household assets jump from about $15 trillion in 2010 to $25 trillion in 2014, according to Green Street Advisors. Household assets for Class B and lower mall customers rose from about $7 trillion in 2010 to a little over $10 trillion in 2014. Class B malls are often saddled with struggling department stores such as Sears or J.C. Penney as anchors, making them less attractive to prospective tenants. Some 24 such malls have closed since 2010, and an additional 60 are on the brink of closure, according to Green Street Advisors.No REIT fund hold Class B or lower mall operators as their largest holding, according to Lipper. J.C Penney and Sears are the most frequent anchor stores at Class C and lower malls, according to Green Street.There are about 1,000 enclosed shopping malls in the U.S. Foot traffic at malls during the November and December holiday shopping season fell from approximately 35 billion visits in 2010 to 17.6 billion in 2013, according to an October Cushman and Wakefield report. Online commerce now accounts for 15 percent of retail sales - just 5 percentage points less than the percentage of retail sales that come from malls and gaining, according to a report from Green Street Advisors.      DEMAND FOR HIGH-END RISING  Investor demand for high-end malls will rise even if consumer spending overall flattens or starts to slow, said Jason Ko, a co-portfolio manager of the $2.1 billion J.P. Morgan Realty Income fund who has 7.8 percent of his portfolio in Simon, his largest position.Macerich Co, the third-largest mall owner in the U.S., rejected a $16.8 billion takeover offer from Simon Property on April 1, a merger that would give Simon an even larger hold of the high-end mall market. Simon is not expected to come back with a higher offer, analysts and fund managers said.""What that attempt signifies is that high quality malls are irreplaceable: difficult to build and difficult to buy,"" Ko said.Shares of Simon Property are down 5.5 percent since Macerich rejected its takeover offer, while shares of Macerich have fallen 2.2 percent over the same time. Over the last 12 months, shares of Simon are up 5.7 percent, or about 2 percentage points less than the 7.9 percent gain in the benchmark index. Simon shares closed Wednesday at $181.31, compared with the average target price of $217.05 among analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters. At that price, Simon is selling at 39 times trailing 12 month earnings, slightly below the average 45 times earnings among its peers, according to Thomson Reuters data.Class B malls, meanwhile, will not only feel the effects of sales declines at J.C. Penney and Sears, but will see increased competition from so-called power centers - suburban developments that are often next to a major highway and include a Home Depot or Best Buy alongside a traditional strip mall, said Ian Goltra, who helps oversee $2 billion in real estate investments at San Francisco-based Forward Funds.Goltra has several short positions for Class B mall operators in his funds, yet expects shares of Simon to rise, even with its high percentage of fund ownership. He has been adding shares of Simon as it has traded in the $180s, down from a high of $205.31 on Jan 28th.""They have the largest portfolio of blue-chip tenants, and that's something their competitors have not been able to replicate,"" he said.   (Reporting by David Randall; editing by Linda Stern and John Pickering)",2015-05-14,SPG,"Thu May 14, 2015 | 1:31am EDT",Fund managers make big bet on high-end malls via Simon,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-funds-malls-analysis-idUSKBN0NZ0B620150514?type=companyNews,0.9548,0.026,0.924,0.049
1135,"  (Updates volume data, adds reporting credit)By Herbert LashNEW YORK, June 19 Shares of mall operator Macerich Co fell as much as 7.3 percent on Friday on reports rival Simon Property Group Inc was selling a 3.6 percent stake, months after its failed takeover bid.Sources told Reuters that Simon Property, the largest U.S. mall operator, was selling 5.7 million shares of Macerich, the No. 3 U.S. mall operator. The shares had been offered in a range of $80.50 to $81 a share, lower than Macerich's close of $82.45 a share on Thursday, sources said.Citigroup was in charge of the block trade, the sources said. Evercore reported the same on Thursday. Macerich declined to comment, and Simon Property did not immediately return a telephone call.Macerich shares were last down 6.2 percent at $76.80, after dropping to as low as $76.40 in early trading. Simon in March offered $95.50 a share for Macerich in a deal valued at $23.2 billion, but Macerich adopted a poison pill and its board unanimously rejected the offer at month's end. On April 1 Simon withdrew its bid.More than 9 million shares of the stock changed hands on Friday, the company's busiest trading day since March 20, when Simon made what it called its final offer for Macerich. Shareholders have questioned Macerich's decision. At the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts' annual REIT Week conference last week an unidentified person demanded to know how Macerich had decided to reject the takeover offer.Art Coppola, chairman and chief executive officer at Macerich, said after talking to investment bankers he did not name and Eastdil Secured, a well-known property brokerage, the board concluded Simon's bid was ""substantially inadequate.""Simon shares dipped 0.4 percent to $181.10.

1136,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to the  EUR750 million issuance of 1.375% senior unsecured notes due 2022 by Simon  International Finance SCA, a subsidiary of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE:  SPG). The notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Simon Property  Group, L.P., the operating partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc. The company  expects to use the net proceeds to reduce its existing euro-denominated  borrowings and for general corporate purposes. A full list of ratings follows at  the end of the release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Simon's 'A' long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the strong quality of  the company's retail real estate portfolio, the company's significant scale and  market-leading access to capital. Other credit strengths include SPG's good  liquidity and financial flexibility, featuring a low AFFO payout ratio and  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt. The biggest wildcard for bondholders over the next two years relates to whether  Simon's recently established and partially utilized $2 billion common stock  repurchase program and its bid for The Macerich Company (NYSE: MAC) reflect a  more shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. The program, combined with  the bid for MAC (should it have been successful), would have increased leverage  by approximately a turn. However, the company has reiterated a commitment to  maintaining its existing ratings. Moreover, Simon withdrew its bid for MAC, and  Fitch expects the company to repurchase a moderate amount of common stock over  the next two years. APPROPRIATE METRICS; SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM A WILDCARD Fitch calculates Simon's leverage at 5.3x as of Sept. 30, 2015 as compared to  5.2x as of Dec. 31, 2014 pro forma for certain acquisitions. Fitch expects  leverage to be in the 5.0x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24 months but closer  to 5.5x this year, following the stabilization of development and re-development  projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x and 5.5x is appropriate for the 'A'  rating, thus Fitch's projections are towards the high-end of the range. Should the company aggressively utilize its common stock repurchase program,  which is not Fitch's expectation, leverage would trend in the 5.5x-6.0x range,  which would be weak for the 'A' rating. Through 3Q15, SPG has repurchased $343  million though the effects on leverage were mitigated by the sale of $454  million of marketable and non-marketable securities (i.e. the MAC shares) in  2Q15. Fitch defines leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring  operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities, which include dividends from Klepierre.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will be in the low 4x over the next  12-to-24 months (4x in 3Q15 and 3.7x in 2014) driven by mid-single digit  releasing spreads. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating  EBITDA including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring  capital expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total  interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  STRONG ASSET QUALITY Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets. The  portfolio has scale and diversity with interests in properties in North America,  Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch also views  SPG's 3Q15 $616 sales per square foot and outperformance relative to other mall  REITs (as measured by SSNOI) as further indications of the portfolios quality.  Simon has consistently outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable  NOI growth exceeding peers by an average of 240 basis points from 2005-2014 and  occupancy outperforming peers by 150 basis points from 2005-2014, demonstrating  strong asset quality. MARKET LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL  Fitch views Simon as having the most consistent and durable access to capital in  the REIT sector, which is a material driver of the 'A' rating. The company  established a commercial paper (CP) program established in 2014 (the first such  program established by a U.S. equity REIT), which it upsized to $1 billion from  $500 million in March 2015. In addition to the CP program, Simon has two  multicurrency credit facilities totaling $6.75 billion. The credit facilities  are comprised of a $4 billion facility and $2.75 billion supplementary facility  (upsized from $2 billion in March 2015), aggregating the largest capacity in the  U.S. REIT sector. Moreover, Simon has traditionally been active in both the  unsecured and secured debt markets.  ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY Liquidity coverage is 1.4x for the period from Oct. 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016 and  0.9x through Dec. 31, 2017 pro forma for the notes issuance. Fitch defines  liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses. Liquidity  sources include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit  facilities pro forma and projected retained cash flows from operating  activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring  capital expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt  maturities through 2016 and 2017 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would  improve to 2.5x and 1.7x, respectively. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)  payout ratio, which was 72.8% in 3Q15, 64% in 2014 compared with 59.2% in 2013  and 57% in 2012. Fitch estimates that the company generates approximately $1  billion of internally generated liquidity per year, which can be deployed for  future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Fitch view's SPG's unencumbered pool as strong on an absolute basis given the  pool's size ($2.6 billion of EBITDA in 2014) and quality. Unencumbered assets  (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) covers net unsecured debt by 2.9x,  which is adequate for the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Simon in Fitch's base case include: --4% same-store NOI growth and 3%-3.5% same-store NOI growth in 2016-2017; --G&A growth to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues; --$1-$1.5 billion in annual development funded predominately with retained cash  flow, generating 9% stabilized yields; --Stock repurchases of less than $500 million cumulative over the next two  years; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds and secured debt; --AFFO payout ratio of approximately 60%.

1139,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, January 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to $1.35  billion of senior unsecured notes issued by Simon Property Group, L.P, the  operating partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc.  The offering totalled $550 million of 2.5% senior unsecured due July 15, 2021  and $800 million of 3.3% senior unsecured notes due Jan. 15, 2026. The company  expects to use the net proceeds to retire three existing mortgage loans, to  redeem the 6.1% notes due 2016, to repay a portion of borrowings under their  unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes. A full  list of ratings follows at the end of the release.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Simon's 'A' long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the strong quality of  the company's retail real estate portfolio, the company's significant scale and  market-leading access to capital. Other credit strengths include SPG's good  liquidity and financial flexibility, featuring a low AFFO payout ratio and  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt. The biggest wildcard for bondholders over the next two years relates to whether  Simon's recently established and partially utilized $2 billion common stock  repurchase program and its bid for The Macerich Company (NYSE: MAC) reflect a  more shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. The program, combined with  the bid for MAC (should it have been successful), would have increased leverage  by approximately a turn. However, the company has reiterated a commitment to  maintaining its existing ratings. Moreover, Simon withdrew its bid for MAC, and  Fitch expects the company to repurchase a moderate amount of common stock over  the next two years. APPROPRIATE METRICS; SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM A WILDCARD Fitch calculates Simon's leverage at 5.3x as of Sept. 30, 2015 as compared to  5.2x as of Dec. 31, 2014 pro forma for certain acquisitions. Fitch expects  leverage to be in the 5.0x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24 months but closer  to 5.5x this year, following the stabilization of development and re-development  projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x and 5.5x is appropriate for the 'A'  rating, and thus Fitch's projections are towards the high-end of the range. Should the company aggressively utilize its common stock repurchase program,  which is not Fitch's expectation, leverage would trend in the 5.5x-6.0x range,  which would be weak for the 'A' rating. Through 3Q15, SPG has repurchased $343  million though the effects on leverage were mitigated by the sale of $454  million of marketable and non-marketable securities (i.e. the MAC shares) in  2Q15. Fitch defines leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring  operating EBITDA including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated  entities, which include dividends from Klepierre.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will be in the low 4x over the next  12-to-24 months (4x in 3Q15 and 3.7x in 2014) driven by mid-single digit  releasing spreads. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating  EBITDA including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring  capital expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total  interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  STRONG ASSET QUALITY Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets. The  portfolio has scale and diversity with interests in properties in North America,  Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch also views  SPG's 3Q15 $616 sales per square foot and outperformance relative to other mall  REITs (as measured by SSNOI) as further indications of the portfolios quality.  Simon has consistently outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable  NOI growth exceeding peers by an average of 240 basis points from 2005-2014 and  occupancy outperforming peers by 150 basis points from 2005-2014, demonstrating  strong asset quality. MARKET LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL  Fitch views Simon as having the most consistent and durable access to capital in  the REIT sector, which is a material driver of the 'A' rating. The company  established a commercial paper (CP) program established in 2014 (the first such  program established by a U.S. equity REIT), which it upsized to $1 billion from  $500 million in March 2015. In addition to the CP program, Simon has two  multicurrency credit facilities totaling $6.75 billion. The credit facilities  are comprised of a $4 billion facility and $2.75 billion supplementary facility  (upsized from $2 billion in March 2015), aggregating the largest capacity in the  U.S. REIT sector. Moreover, Simon has traditionally been active in both the  unsecured and secured debt markets.  ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY Liquidity coverage is 1.0x for the period Oct. 1, 2015 through Dec. 31, 2017 pro  forma for the notes issued in January 2016, the EUR denominated notes issued in  November 2015 and the redemption of the 6.125% and 7.375% notes due 2018. Fitch  defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses.  Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit  facilities pro forma and projected retained cash flows from operating  activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring  capital expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt  maturities through 2017 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would improve to  1.6x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's low adjusted funds from operations (AFFO)  payout ratio, which was 72.8% in 3Q15, 64% in 2014 compared with 59.2% in 2013  and 57% in 2012. Fitch estimates that the company generates approximately $1  billion of internally generated liquidity per year, which can be deployed for  future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Fitch view's SPG's unencumbered pool as strong on an absolute basis given the  pool's size ($2.6 billion of EBITDA in 2014) and quality. Unencumbered assets  (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) covers net unsecured debt by 2.9x,  which is adequate for the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Simon in Fitch's base case include: --4% same-store NOI growth and 3%-3.5% same-store NOI growth in 2016-2017; --G&A growth to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues; --$1-$1.5 billion in annual development funded predominately with retained cash  flow, generating 9% stabilized yields; --Stock repurchases of less than $500 million cumulative over the next two  years; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds and secured debt; --AFFO payout ratio of approximately 60%.

The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A deviation from SPG's public commitment to maintaining existing ratings  and/or any other actions that may result in a deterioration in the company's  market-leading access to capital on an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x.

1140,"  Department store operator J.C. Penney Co Inc (JCP.N) said it is pursuing a potential sale and partial leaseback of its headquarters in Texas to reduce debt and costs. J.C. Penney employs more than 3,000 workers at its Plano, Texas headquarters, which it has occupied since 1992. The retail chain's decision comes at a time when several U.S. department store operators are looking to create value from their vast real-estate holdings as their core business of selling clothes and home goods come under pressure.Hedge fund Starboard Value LP urged Macy's Inc (M.N) last month to enter into joint ventures for its stores, including its flagship Herald Square store in New York, to realize greater value from its real estate assets. Struggling retailer Sears Holdings Corp (SHLD.O) laid out plans in April last year to raise more than $2.5 billion by creating a real estate investment trust, Seritage Growth Properties (SRG.N), that would hold about 254 Sears and Kmart stores.     The company also entered into three joint ventures with mall operators, including Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) and Macerich Co (MAC.N), to sell some of its stores.J.C. Penney said on Friday the cost of leasing space would be offset by reducing maintenance costs, property taxes and lower interest expenses through paying down debt with proceeds from the sale. CBRE Group Inc's (CBG.N) Capital Markets unit has been selected to find buyers for the 1.8 million-square-foot office campus located in Legacy Business Park in Plano.J.C. Penney had in 2014 decided to contribute a significant portion of the land surrounding its headquarters to a joint venture with a team of developers.

1141,"   By Trevor Hunnicutt | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Stock mutual funds based in the United States posted $2.1 billion in withdrawals last week for the second consecutive week, Investment Company Institute (ICI) data showed on Wednesday, as U.S. equities broke a five-week winning streak.The stock funds posted outflows after attacks in Belgium weighed on investor sentiment. Returns were also held back by a stronger U.S. dollar and comments by U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers suggesting the potential for an April hike in benchmark interest rates. U.S.-based mutual funds that invest mainly in companies based within the country posted $2 billion in outflows in the week that ended March 23.Outflows from international stock funds moderated to $108 million in the latest week, compared with $558 million the previous week, as investors took less money from emerging-markets funds. U.S.-based funds invested in those riskier markets posted just $79 million in outflows during the week, compared with $1 billion the previous week.Investors ended an 11-week streak of inflows that had brought a total $22 billion to funds invested in developed markets outside the United States, like Europe and Japan, during the week. Those funds posted $29 million in outflows, according to ICI.""Investors continued to favor bonds funds over equity funds, with municipal bonds and investment-grade taxable bonds dominating,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, who directs mutual-fund research at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""Within equities, the recent willingness to take on risk through small and mid-cap U.S. funds has disappeared, causing outflows.""Bond funds enjoyed another strong week, taking in $4.7 billion. Investment-grade bond funds attracted $1.6 billion, while lower-grade high-yield funds took in $420 million, ICI said. Prices on corporate debt have improved in recent weeks as fears that some energy companies would default abated and oil prices improved. Municipal-bond funds took in $1.6 billion, their 25th straight week of inflows. Investors added $683 million to taxable-government bond funds, the 15th straight week of net new cash for those safe-haven funds, according to ICI.The following table shows estimated ICI flows for the past five weeks (all figures in millions of dollars):                           3/23    3/16    3/9     3/2  2/24/2016                       Total equity  -2,144  -2,087  1,472      45      4,441                     -Domestic     -2,035  -1,528   -240  -2,189      2,090                     -World          -108    -558  1,712   2,234      2,350                     Hybrid         1,774     225  1,406     987      1,601                      Total bond     4,673   4,921  5,939   4,100        -99                     -Taxable       3,087   3,858  4,906   3,166     -1,120                     -Municipal     1,586   1,063  1,032     934      1,020                     Total          4,303   3,060  8,816   5,132      5,942           (Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Dan Grebler)",2016-03-30,SPG,"Wed Mar 30, 2016 | 4:40pm EDT",Investors shy away from U.S. stock mutual funds for second week: ICI,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-usa-mutualfunds-ici-idUSKCN0WW2H4?type=companyNews,0.9801,0.039,0.856,0.105

1143,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan and Tracy Rucinski  Teen apparel retailer Pacific Sunwear of California Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Thursday, succumbing to mounting losses and intense competition from fast-fashion retailers and online rivals.The company, which joins recent U.S. Chapter 11 filings by surfwear brand Quicksilver and teen retailer American Apparel, plans to be taken private by investment firm Golden Gate once it emerges from bankruptcy, it said in a statement on Thursday.Its shares fell to a record low of 5 cents on Thursday and were still down 42 percent at 5.5 cents in late afternoon.Citing ""significant and unusual trading,"" lawyers for the retailer asked a judge to restrict trading on Thursday due to concerns that a significant change in ownership could impair its ability to use tax benefits on operating losses down the road.Founded in 1982 as a surf shop, PacSun has posted an annual net loss since the financial crisis hit in 2008. It had about $342.7 million of net operating losses as of Jan. 31, which can be used to reduce tax liabilities if it becomes profitable again.""The company believes that this is an extremely valuable asset of the bankruptcy estate,"" Joseph Barry of Young Conaway Stargatt & Taylor said at an emergency hearing in Delaware on Thursday. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurie Silverstein approved the interim motion and holders of PacSun stock will be notified.Pacific Sunwear said Golden Gate plans to convert more than 65 percent of its debt into equity and provide a minimum of $20 million in additional capital. Golden Gate had lent PacSun about $60 million in 2011.The company also said it had a debtor-in-possession credit agreement of $100 million with Wells Fargo Bank. The Anaheim, California-based retailer listed assets in the range of $50 million to $100 million, and liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million, according to its court filing.It named Nike Inc and mall operator Simon Property Group Inc among its creditors, while top investors include investment firm GI2 Ltd with a 28.6 percent stake and Adage Capital Management LP with a 14.1 percent stake.PacSun said it would continue to operate all of its 600 stores and does not expect the bankruptcy filing to have an immediate impact on employees.Rival Aeropostale Inc said in March it was exploring strategic alternatives, including a sale, an option that sector experts said PacSun may also need to contemplate.

U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Laurie Silverstein approved the interim motion and holders of PacSun stock will be notified. Pacific Sunwear said Golden Gate plans to convert more than 65 percent of its debt into equity and provide a minimum of $20 million in additional capital. Golden Gate had lent PacSun about $60 million in 2011.The company also said it had a debtor-in-possession credit agreement of $100 million with Wells Fargo Bank.The Anaheim, California-based retailer listed assets in the range of $50 million to $100 million, and liabilities of between $100 million and $500 million, according to its court filing. It named Nike Inc (NKE.N) and mall operator Simon Property Group Inc (SPG.N) among its creditors, while top investors include investment firm GI2 Ltd with a 28.6 percent stake and Adage Capital Management LP with a 14.1 percent stake.PacSun said it would continue to operate all of its 600 stores and does not expect the bankruptcy filing to have an immediate impact on employees.Rival Aeropostale Inc ARO.N said in March it was exploring strategic alternatives, including a sale, an option that sector experts said PacSun may also need to contemplate.

1145,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 12 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to EUR500  million of 1.25% senior unsecured notes issued by Simon International Finance,  S.C.A., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG). The  notes are guaranteed by Simon Property Group LP. A full list of ratings follows  at the end of this release. KEY RATING DRIVERS Simon's 'A' Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the strong quality of  the company's retail real estate portfolio, its significant scale, and its  market-leading access to capital. Other credit strengths include SPG's good  liquidity and financial flexibility, featuring a low AFFO payout ratio and  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt. The biggest wildcard for bondholders relates to whether Simon's partially  utilized $2 billion common stock repurchase program and its bid for The Macerich  Company (NYSE: MAC) last year reflect a more shareholder-friendly capital  allocation policy. However, the company has reiterated a commitment to  maintaining its existing ratings.  APPROPRIATE METRICS  Fitch calculates Simon's leverage was 5.4x and 5.5x for the trailing 12 months  (TTM) and quarter ended March 31, 2016 as compared to 5.2x and 5.1x for 2015 and  2014, respectively. Fitch expects leverage to be in the 5.0x-5.5x range over the  next 12-to-24 months but closer to 5.5x this year, following the stabilization  of development and re-development projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x and  5.5x is appropriate for the 'A' rating, and thus Fitch's projections are towards  the high-end of the range. Should the company aggressively utilize its common stock repurchase program,  which is not Fitch's expectation, leverage could trend in the 5.5x-6.0x range,  which would be weak for the 'A' rating. During 1Q16, SPG did not complete any  share repurchases but maintains $1.66 billion in capacity on its $2 billion  share repurchase program announced in April 2015 and authorized for a 24-month  period. When including 50% of preferred stock in total debt, SPG's leverage was  5.5x and 5.4x for the quarter and TTM ended March 31, 2016. Fitch defines  leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring operating EBITDA  including recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated entities, which  include dividends from Klepierre.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will sustain in the low 4x over the  next 12-to-24 months (4.3x and 4.1x for quarter and TTM ended March 31, 2016 and  4.1x in 2015) driven by mid-single digit releasing spreads. Fitch defines  fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA including cash distributions  from unconsolidated entities less recurring capital expenditures and  straight-line rent adjustments, divided by total interest incurred and preferred  stock dividends. STRONG ASSET QUALITY Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets. The  portfolio has scale and diversity with interests in properties in North America,  Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch also views  SPG's 1Q16 $613 sales per square foot and outperformance relative to other mall  REITs (as measured by SSNOI) as further indications of the portfolios quality.  Simon has consistently outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable  NOI growth exceeding peers by an average of 240 basis points from 2005-2015 and  occupancy outperforming peers by 100 basis points from 2005-2015. MARKET LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL Fitch views Simon as having the most consistent and durable access to capital in  the REIT sector, which is a material driver of the 'A' rating. The company  established a commercial paper (CP) program in 2014 (the first such program  created by a U.S. equity REIT), which it upsized to $1 billion from $500 million  in March 2015. In addition to the CP program, Simon has two multicurrency credit  facilities totalling $7.5 billion. The credit facilities are comprised of a $4  billion facility and $3.5 billion supplementary facility (upsized from $2  billion in March 2015 with the accordion option exercised in April 2016),  aggregating the largest capacity in the U.S. REIT sector. Moreover, Simon has  traditionally been active in both the unsecured and secured debt markets. ADEQUATE LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY Liquidity coverage is 1.2x for the period April 1, 2016 through Dec. 31, 2017  pro forma for the EUR denominated notes issued in May 2016, the exercised  accordion option on the revolving line of credit and the closing of the  acquisition of The Shops at Crystals. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as  liquidity sources divided by liquidity uses. Liquidity sources include  unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit facilities and projected  retained cash flows from operating activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata  debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures and development  expenditures. If 80% of secured debt maturities through 2017 are refinanced,  liquidity coverage would improve to 1.8x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's consistently low adjusted funds from operations  (AFFO) payout ratio, which was 64.5% in 1Q16 and 66.7% in 2015 compared with 64%  in 2014 and 59.2% in 2013. Fitch estimates that the company generates greater  than $1 billion of internally generated liquidity per year, which can be  deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Fitch view's SPG's unencumbered pool as strong on an absolute basis given the  pool's size ($3 billion of EBITDA in 2015) and quality. Unencumbered assets  (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) cover net unsecured debt by 2.8x,  which is adequate for the rating. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions for Simon in Fitch's base case include: --4% same-store NOI growth and 3%-3.5% same-store NOI growth in 2016-2017; --G&A growth to maintain historical margins relative to total revenues; --$1-$1.5 billion in annual development funded predominately with retained cash  flow, generating 9% stabilized yields; --Stock repurchases of less than $500 million cumulative over the next two  years; --Debt repayment with the issuance of new unsecured bonds and secured debt; --AFFO payout ratio of approximately 60%. RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.4x at  March 31, 2016); --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x  (fixed-charge coverage was 4.1x at March 31, 2016). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's ratings and/or  Outlook: --A deviation from SPG's public commitment to maintaining existing ratings  and/or any other actions that may result in a deterioration in the company's  market-leading access to capital on an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 3x.

1146,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, July 25 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings for Simon  Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG) and the obligations of its subsidiaries  (detailed at the end of this release), including the Issuer Default Rating (IDR)  at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS SPG's 'A' IDR reflects the company's high-quality retail real estate portfolio,  cycle-tested management team, its market-leading access to capital, and its  significant scale which influences efficiencies and the aforementioned access to  capital. Other strengths include its financial flexibility that stems from a low  dividend payout ratio and a sizable unencumbered pool. Partially offsetting  these strengths is leverage that is low on an absolute basis but high relative  to the rating sensitivities for the 'A' rating. Moreover, SPG is unspecific  about its financial policies and credit rating targets and has demonstrated a  willingness to flex the balance sheet for external growth opportunities.  LEVERAGE STABILIZING AT CURRENT LEVELS Fitch expects leverage will be in the 5x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24  months but closer to 5.5x for 2016, following the stabilization of development  and re-development projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x-5.5x is  appropriate for the 'A' rating and thus Fitch's projections are towards the  high-end of the range. These levels are largely unchanged from where SPG has  operated recently with leverage at 5.4x and 5.5x for the trailing 12 months  (TTM) and quarter ended March 31, 2016, compared to 5.4x and 5.2x for full years  2015 and 2014.  Fitch defines leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring  operating EBITDA including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities,  which includes dividends from its investment in Klepierre shares. Leverage when  including 50% of preferred stock and preferred units was 5.5x, 5.4x and 5.2x for  the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and the years 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will sustain in the mid-to-high 4x  range over the next 12-to-24 months as compared to 4.1x for the TTM ended March  31, 2016. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating EBITDA  including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities less recurring capital  expenditures and straight-line rent adjustments divided by total interest  incurred and preferred stock dividends.  STRONG ASSET QUALITY DRIVING OPERATING PERFORMANCE Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets, which  has supported operating performance despite tenant headwinds and should be more  financeable on a relative basis. The portfolio has scale and diversity with  interests in properties in North America, Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium  Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch views SPG's 1Q16 $613 sales per square foot and  outperformance relative to other mall REITs (as measured by SSNOI growth) as  further indications of the portfolio's quality. Simon has consistently  outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable NOI growth exceeding  peers by an average of 240 basis points (bps) from 2005-2015 and occupancy  outperforming peers by 100 bps from 2005-2015. SPG has sought to address secular tenant pressures by reducing exposure to  smaller and/or weaker assets through the Washington Prime Group spin-off and  reinvesting in its portfolio through expansion and redevelopment projects. Fitch  notes nonetheless that persistent tenant headwinds could affect the productivity  and financeability of SPG's portfolio. MARKET-LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL Fitch views SPG as having sector-leading and durable access to capital, and its  relative and absolute access to debt capital are primary factors behind the 'A'  rating. Substantiating this view are the diversity of SPG's capital sources. SPG  has demonstrated access to debt capital in multiple currencies (USD and EUR),  across a wide range of tenors (commercial paper through 30-year notes) and at  all points in the cycle. SPG re-opened the REIT unsecured debt market in 2009  when it issued $650 million of 10-year notes at 10.4%.  SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY RELATIVE TO OBLIGATIONS SPG has appropriate financial flexibility considering the size of its  obligations. SPG's primary sources of liquidity are its unrestricted cash and  availability under the two revolving credit facilities totalling $7.5 billion  and the contingent liquidity in the unencumbered asset pool.  Liquidity coverage is consistent with the sector at 1.2x for the period April 1,  2016 through Dec. 31, 2017 pro forma for the EUR-denominated notes issued in May  2016, the exercised accordion option on the revolving line of credit and the  acquisition and financing of The Shops at Crystals. Liquidity sources include  unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit facilities and projected  retained cash flows from operating activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata  debt maturities, projected recurring capital expenditures and development  expenditures. If 80% of secured debt maturities through 2017 are refinanced,  liquidity coverage would improve to 1.9x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's consistently low adjusted funds from operations  (AFFO) payout ratio, which was 64.5% in 1Q16 and 66.7% in 2015, compared with  64% in 2014 and 59.2% in 2013. Fitch estimates that the company generates  greater than $1 billion of internally generated liquidity per year, which can be  deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Unencumbered  assets (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) cover net unsecured debt by  2.7x, which is appropriate for the rating. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that SPG's operating fundamentals will  remain favorable over the next 12-to-24 months and that the issuer will maintain  leverage consistent with the 'A' rating. Beyond the rating horizon, Fitch  considers the mall's long-term competitive position as a key determinant of  SPG's operating fundamentals, the financeability of its assets and its overall  access to capital.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within our rating case for the issuer include: --Operating fundamentals remain accommodative but decelerate modestly from  mid-single-digit SSNOI growth to reflect retailer headwinds; --SPG continues to match redevelopment and expansion capex to retained cash flow  from operations after dividends; --SPG maintains market-leading access to capital, refinancing all secured and  unsecured debt with like amounts but does not issue equity.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (TTM leverage was 5.4x  at March 31, 2016) --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (TTM  coverage was 4.1x at March 31, 2016). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Should SPG demonstrate or speak to more flexible financial policies that  result in a deterioration in the company's market-leading access to capital on  an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Should the competitive position of malls generally or SPG's portfolio  specifically deteriorate due to factors such as retailer headwinds or changing  distribution channels, resulting in weaker operating fundamentals and  financeability of SPG's portfolio;  --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining below 3x. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:  Simon Property Group, Inc.  --Long-Term IDR at 'A'; --Preferred stock at 'BBB+'.  Simon Property Group, L.P.  --Long-Term IDR at 'A';  --Short-Term IDR at 'F1';  --Senior unsecured revolving credit facilities at 'A';  --Senior unsecured notes at 'A';  --CP notes at 'F1'.  Simon CP 2  --CP notes at 'F1'.  Simon International Finance, S.C.A.  --Unsecured guaranteed notes at 'A'.  The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch has affirmed and withdrawn the 'A' rating on term loans as a class of  obligations for Simon Property Group, L.P., as the obligation ($240 million  senior unsecured term loan) was repaid early.

1153,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to the  $1.85 billion multi-tranche senior notes issued by Simon Property Group, L.P.,  the operating partnership of Simon Property Group, Inc. (NYSE: SPG). The  offering is comprised of $550 million 2.35% notes due 2022, $750 million 3.25%  notes due 2026, and $550 million notes due 2046.  KEY RATING DRIVERS SPG's 'A' Issuer Default Rating (IDR) reflects the company's high-quality retail  real estate portfolio, cycle-tested management team, its market-leading access  to capital, and its significant scale which influences efficiencies and the  aforementioned access to capital. Other strengths include its financial  flexibility that stems from a low dividend payout ratio and a sizable  unencumbered pool. Partially offsetting these strengths is leverage that is low  on an absolute basis but high relative to the rating sensitivities for the 'A'  rating. Moreover, SPG is unspecific about its financial policies and credit  rating targets and has demonstrated a willingness to flex the balance sheet for  external growth opportunities. LEVERAGE STABILIZING AT CURRENT LEVELS Fitch expects leverage will be in the 5x-5.5x range over the next 12-to-24  months but closer to 5.5x for 2016, following the stabilization of development  and re-development projects. Leverage sustaining between 4.5x-5.5x is  appropriate for the 'A' rating and thus Fitch's projections are towards the  high-end of the range. These levels are largely unchanged from where SPG has  operated recently with leverage at 5.3x for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016,  compared to 5.4x and 5.2x for full years 2015 and 2014.  Fitch defines leverage as debt less readily available cash to recurring  operating EBITDA including cash distributions from unconsolidated entities plus  dividends from its investment in Klepierre shares net of distributions to  noncontrolling property interests. Leverage when including 50% of preferred  stock and preferred units was unchanged. Fitch projects that fixed-charge coverage will sustain in the mid-to-high 4x  range over the next 12-to-24 months as compared to 4.5x for the quarter ended  Sept. 30, 2016. Fitch defines fixed-charge coverage as recurring operating  EBITDA plus cash distributions from unconsolidated entities net of distributions  to noncontrolling property interests less recurring capital expenditures and  straight-line rent adjustments divided by total interest incurred and preferred  stock dividends.  STRONG ASSET QUALITY DRIVING OPERATING PERFORMANCE Fitch considers SPG's portfolio to be prime with notable trophy assets, which  has supported operating performance despite tenant headwinds and should be more  financeable on a relative basis. The portfolio has scale and diversity with  interests in properties in North America, Asia and Europe, ranging from Premium  Outlets to luxury malls. Fitch views SPG's 3Q16 $604 sales per square foot and  outperformance relative to other mall REITs (as measured by SSNOI growth) as  further indications of the portfolio's quality. Simon has consistently  outperformed its U.S. mall REIT peers, with comparable NOI growth exceeding  peers by an average of 240 basis points (bps) from 2005-2015 and occupancy  outperforming peers by 100 bps from 2005-2015. SPG has sought to address secular tenant pressures by reducing exposure to  smaller and/or weaker assets through the Washington Prime Group spin-off and  reinvesting in its portfolio through expansion and redevelopment projects.  Nonetheless, persistent tenant headwinds could affect the productivity and  financeability of SPG's portfolio. MARKET-LEADING ACCESS TO CAPITAL Fitch views SPG as having sector-leading and durable access to capital, and its  relative and absolute access to debt capital are primary factors behind the 'A'  rating. Substantiating this view is the diversity of SPG's capital sources. SPG  has demonstrated access to debt capital in multiple currencies (USD and EUR),  across a wide range of tenors (commercial paper through 30-year notes) and at  all points in the cycle. SPG re-opened the REIT unsecured debt market in 2009  when it issued $650 million of 10-year notes at 10.4%.  SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY RELATIVE TO OBLIGATIONS SPG has appropriate financial flexibility considering the size of its  obligations. SPG's primary sources of liquidity are its unrestricted cash and  availability under the two revolving credit facilities totalling $7.5 billion  and the contingent liquidity in the unencumbered asset pool.  Liquidity coverage is consistent with the sector at 1.7x for the period Oct. 1,  2016 through Dec. 31, 2018 pro forma for the notes issued in November 2016.  Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit  facilities and projected retained cash flows from operating activities.  Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities, projected recurring capital  expenditures and development expenditures. If 80% of secured debt maturities  through 2017 are refinanced, liquidity coverage would improve to 2.2x. Liquidity is enhanced by Simon's consistently low adjusted funds from operations  (AFFO) payout ratio, which was 67% in 3Q16 and 66.7% in 2015, compared with 64%  in 2014 and 59.2% in 2013. Fitch estimates that the company generates greater  than $1 billion of internally generated liquidity per year, which can be  deployed for future investments, development and/or debt repayment. Unencumbered  assets (based on a stressed 7% capitalization rate) cover net unsecured debt by  2.7x, which is appropriate for the rating. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's view that SPG's operating fundamentals will  remain favorable over the next 12-to-24 months and that the issuer will maintain  leverage consistent with the 'A' rating. Beyond the rating horizon, Fitch  considers the mall's long-term competitive position as a key determinant of  SPG's operating fundamentals, the financeability of its assets and its overall  access to capital.  KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for the issuer include: --Operating fundamentals remain accommodative but decelerate modestly from  mid-single-digit SSNOI growth to reflect retailer headwinds; --SPG continues to match redevelopment and expansion capex to retained cash flow  from operations after dividends; --SPG maintains market-leading access to capital, refinancing all secured and  unsecured debt with like amounts but does not issue equity.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may have a positive impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining below 4.5x (leverage was 5.3x for  the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016) --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining above 3.5x (fixed  charge coverage was 4.5x for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2016). The following factors may have a negative impact on SPG's Ratings and/or  Outlook: --Should SPG demonstrate or speak to more flexible financial policies that  result in a deterioration in the company's market-leading access to capital on  an absolute or relative basis; --A leveraging transaction that materially weakens the company's credit profile  and/or aggressive utilization of the company's common stock repurchase program,  resulting in Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 5.5x; --Should the competitive position of malls generally or SPG's portfolio  specifically deteriorate due to factors such as retailer headwinds or changing  distribution channels, resulting in weaker operating fundamentals and  financeability of SPG's portfolio;  --Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage sustaining below 3x.

1187,"  (Adds details)Jan 7 Apple Inc suppliers Cirrus Logic Inc and Qorvo Inc on Thursday added to growing worries about slowing shipments of iPhone 6S and 6S Plus by cutting their revenue estimates for the third quarter.Qorvo's shares fell 12.4 percent in after-market trading, while Cirrus' stock slumped 9.5 percent before regaining some ground.The downbeat estimates follow Japanese daily Nikkei's report on Tuesday that output of the latest iPhone models would be cut by about 30 percent in the January-March time frame so dealers could offload stock.Qorvo cut its revenue estimate for the December quarter to about $620 million from $720 million-$730 million, blaming weaker-than-expected demand for its radio-frequency chips used in mobile devices. Analysts on average were expecting $723.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Cirrus, which gets about three-quarters of its revenue from Apple, cut its revenue estimate to about $347 million from $370 million-$400 million. Analysts on average were expecting $385.9 million for the third quarter ended December.Cirrus, which makes audio chips for Apple, said the revenue cut reflected weaker-than-expected demand for certain portable audio products.

Apple shares were down 0.6 percent at $95.87.Apple suppliers' shares have taken a beating ever since reports about slowing iPhone 6S and 6S Plus demand surfaced towards the end of 2015.(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",2016-01-07,SWKS,"Thu Jan 7, 2016 | 6:24pm EST",UPDATE 1-Apple suppliers cut revenue estimates amid iPhone shipment fears,http://www.reuters.com//article/cirrus-logic-results-idUSL3N14R5GJ20160107?type=companyNews,-0.7964,0.093,0.85,0.057
1188,"   By Noel Randewich | SAN FRANCISCO  SAN FRANCISCO After months of declines in Apple's (AAPL.O) stock, sentiment appears to be mending as investors focus on steady earnings expectations and bet that the expected launch of a new iPhone will add badly-needed fuel to sputtering sales.Battered by nearly a year of off-and-on declines from  record highs because of fears of a slowdown in iPhone sales, Apple's stock now is valued closer to IBM, which has disappointed Wall Street for the past four years with declining revenue, than to Silicon Valley technology pioneers Alphabet and Tesla Motors.Apple shares have increased 5 percent in the past two weeks as Wall Street bets the company this month will launch a less expensive iPhone to boost sales in developing countries like China. With U.S. consumers upgrading their smartphones less often, manufacturers have been relying on China for growth.Shareholders this week pointed to Apple's reliable cash generation, beaten down valuation and its wild card potential for future game-changing products as key reasons for owning it.""This company has a history of doing better than expectations and surprising people,"" said Daniel Morgan, Senior Portfolio Manager at Synovus Trust Company, which holds over 1 million shares of Apple. ""Where else can I go and find a company trading at 10 or 11 times earnings that has had such a great history?""At $100.97 a share on Wednesday, Apple is selling at 10.7 times its expected earnings per share over the next 12 months. Its  average forward price-earnings-ratio has been 13 over the past two years. By comparison, Internet behemoth Alphabet (GOOGL.O), whose Android mobile platform competes against Apple's iOS, trades at 20 times expected earnings and 13-year old Tesla Motors (TSLA.O) trades at 132 times earnings. International Business Machines (IBM.N), which is struggling to expand into a high-growth business like cloud computing, has a P/E of 10.2, according to Thomson Reuters data.""Unless something big happens, (Apple) doesn't deserve to trade at 20 to 25 times earnings anymore. It's just too big,"" said David Meier, a portfolio manager at Motley Fool Funds. ""But as a high-quality company, could it trade at 15 times earnings? Certainly."" A target of 15 times its next 12 months' expected earnings would put Apple at around $138. In another hint of improving sentiment, Apple's stock has recently moved above its 50-day moving average for the first time since December.The stock's selloff in recent months has boosted Apple's dividend yield to 2.2 percent from 1.5 percent a year ago.Analysts' covering Apple have been little help to investors. Ahead of the stock's 20-percent drop that started in December, 41 analysts recommended buying Apple shares while just one recommended selling, according to Thomson Reuters data. Currently, no analysts recommend selling, while 38 recommend buying. A new iPhone with a smaller 4-inch screen will likely boost volumes by about 5 percent this year, an increase not yet incorporated into Wall Street's expectations, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski wrote in a report on Monday.Apple chip supplier Dialog Semiconductor (DLGS.DE) on Tuesday forecast March-quarter revenue below analysts' expectations, but said it still expects single-digit growth for the year. That suggests the March quarter could mark the low-point in iPhone shipments, with demand for new models building later in the year, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani wrote in a research note.Jeffrey Carbone, Senior Partner at Cornerstone Financial Partners, said Apple remains a staple holding at his firm but that he has recently turned his attention to Apple suppliers including Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), which he believes is undervalued. ""We have a normal weighting on Apple, we like the company, but we think the supply chain could have greater potential,"" Carbone said.

1190,"   By Julia Love and Anya George Tharakan  Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Tuesday posted its first-ever decline in iPhone sales and its first revenue drop in 13 years as the company credited with inventing the smartphone struggles with an increasingly saturated market.The company's sales dropped by more than a quarter in China, its most important market after the United States, and it also forecast another disappointing quarter for global revenues.Its shares fell about 8 percent, dropping below $100 for the first time since February. A hike in Apple's share buyback and  dividend as well as bumper revenue from services failed to mollify investors.Apple's results followed disappointing quarterly reports from Microsoft Corp(MSFT.O) and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), and microblog Twitter (TWTR.N) also on Tuesday reported results that missed expectations.Apple said it sold 51.2 million iPhones in its second fiscal quarter, down from 61.2 million in the same quarter a year ago but above analysts' estimates of about 50 million devices. While Apple executives had predicted iPhone sales would decline this quarter, they must reassure investors that the drop  represents a momentary roadblock, rather than a permanent shift for the product that fueled its meteoric rise.After years of blockbuster sales, many investors fear the iPhone has reached saturation, spelling the end for Apple's exponential growth.""Apple needs to come up with a radical new innovation or product rather than just the current incremental improvements to existing products. This is the only way in which it will reinvigorate sales growth,"" said Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino.Apple Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters that the success of the iPhone 6 a year earlier had set a difficult bar to beat in the second quarter. ""The iPhone 6 is an anomaly,"" he said.  But Chief Executive Tim Cook told analysts that the smartphone market was not growing, reinforcing wider concerns of saturation. Cook also conceded that the iPhone 6S was driving customers to replace phones at a much lower rate than the 6. ""I don't mean just a hair lower; it's a lot lower,"" he said. ""If we'd had the same rate on 6S as 6, it would be time for a huge party.""He pointed to the services division, which includes Apple Music and the App Store, as a bright spot. Its revenue grew 20 percent to $6 billion and surpassed iMac and iPad sales.Cook also hinted that Apple had more gadgets to come.     ""The future of Apple is very bright,"" he said. ""Our product pipeline has amazing innovations in store."" Earnings of $1.90 per share fell short of the average analyst estimate of $2 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue of $50.56 billion missed expectations of $51.97 billion.  Apple forecast third-quarter revenue of $41 billion to $43 billion, short of the Wall Street consensus of $47.3 billion. Apple also said it was raising its capital return program by $50 billion through a $35 billion increase in its share buyback authorization and a 10 percent rise in the quarterly dividend.iPHONE SE DEMAND STRONG In March, Apple released the iPhone SE, a smaller, 4-inch-screen phone featuring much of the company's latest technology. Although sales of the phone were not captured in the second quarter, the device is off to a strong start, particularly in emerging markets, Maestri said. ""The situation right now around the world is that we are supply-constrained,"" he said. ""The demand has been very, very strong."" Although Apple's revenue in Greater China fell 26 percent from the year-ago quarter, Maestri stressed that the company was ""extremely optimistic"" about China. ""We continue to make a lot of investment there,"" he said.Cook said that mainland China sales were down only 7 percent in constant currency, attributing much of the Greater China drop to Hong Kong, where strength in the local dollar, which is pegged to U.S. currency, deterred tourist shopping. The company did not comment on prospects for its iBooks Stores and iTunes Movie service, which were shut down last week in China.The drop in after-hours shares wipes out roughly $46 billion in market capitalization, roughly the value of heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N). In reaction to Apple's results, shares of its suppliers Skyworks Solutions (SWKS.O), Qorvo (QRVO.O), Broadcom (AVGO.O) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O) all fell 2 percent or more on Tuesday.

1192,"   By Rodrigo Campos  U.S. stocks ended slightly higher on Wednesday after fears eased that the Federal Reserve would strongly signal it would raise interest rates in June, though a slump in Apple shares weighed on the Nasdaq index.Stocks in the telecom and utilities sectors, seen as proxies for fixed income returns when Treasury yields are expected to remain low, rose sharply after the Fed's announcement. That indicates market participants expect U.S. government yields to remain subdued.""The big takeaway here is they (the Fed) continued to be positive on the domestic economy,"" said John Bailer, senior portfolio manager at The Boston Company Asset Management. ""They have taken out some of the risk on the global economy.""""It is slightly hawkish in my mind but not enough to get the market worried about it.""Economists polled by Reuters expect two rate increases this year but futures prices show traders do not expect a hike until at least September, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool. The Fed next meets on June 14-15. While the labor market continues to gain strength, inflation remains below the central bank's 2 percent target and mixed economic data could cloud the path to future rate hikes.The technology sector remained the largest weight on the market after Apple slumped more than 6 percent following its first revenue decline in over a decade.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 51.23 points, or 0.28 percent, to 18,041.55, the S&P 500 gained 3.45 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,095.15 and the Nasdaq Composite fell 25.14 points, or 0.51 percent, to 4,863.14.
