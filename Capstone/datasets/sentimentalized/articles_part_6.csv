The S&P 500 ended 0.66 percent below its record close of 1,848.38 set on January 15.""The late-day selling was somewhat induced by the futures and options expirations on the close; it's hard to put too much credence in the market's action in the last couple hours because there's so much positioning that has to do with where things close,"" James said.February individual equity options and some options on stock indexes stopped trading at Friday's close and will settle on Saturday.

54,"  (Adds details from Havana home owners, travel industry)By Emily StephensonWASHINGTON, April 2 Online home-rental marketplace Airbnb Inc now offers properties in Cuba, the company said on Thursday, as it looks to capitalize on an expected travel boom resulting from the normalizing of relations between the United States and the Communist-run nation.President Barack Obama has loosened some Cold War-era travel restrictions, allowing Americans to visit the Caribbean island for a range of reasons, such as family visits or education.U.S. lawmakers have proposed further easing to permit purely tourist travel. But pure beach and resort tourism remains illegal for Americans in Cuba under a five-decades-old trade embargo.Airbnb said on Thursday that after Obama announced the changes, it saw a 70 percent spike in U.S. searches for rentals in Cuba. In response, it has added more than 1,000 listings on the island. Americans booking stays in Cuba on the site will have to assert that they have a license from the U.S. government to travel there.Airbnb's Cuba services are only open to U.S. travelers, but could expand to include people from other countries, the company said.""They made us this proposal a few days ago and we're delighted to accept what they offered us,"" said Reinier Torres, who manages a Havana home on Airbnb's service. ""It's a great opportunity for us to attract American tourism ... though we haven't seen any practical results yet."" The National Foreign Trade Council, a lobbying group that pushes for open international trade, said Airbnb's expansion would help meet ""soaring demand"" for lodging in Cuba.U.S. travel companies licensed to offer educational and cultural tours to Cuba are reporting a surge in interest from Americans, with bookings for this year up steeply.Airline charter companies flying to Cuba from two Florida cities, Miami and Tampa, are also reporting increased business. In the first three months of 2015, they reported about 175,000 passengers. Travel experts say Cuba's state-run hotel sector lacks the capacity to handle a major increase in U.S. visitors, without the variety of high-end hotels found in other destinations.The private bed and breakfast option is increasingly poised to pick up the slack in the state sector and could spur investment in new hotel construction said Emilio Morales, president of the Havana Consulting Group in Miami.There are between 6,000 to 8,000 rooms for rent in private homes in Havana, priced at about $30-35 a night, compared with $150-$200 in standard hotels.A lack of internet and banking services in Cuba still greatly limits online private sector transactions. But Cubans are already familiar with similar services in Canada and Europe that offer pre-paid home stays in Cuba, using money transfer and cash delivery systems to pay home owners, Morales said.Other U.S. businesses have begun offering services in Cuba. Kayak, owned by online travel agency Priceline Group Inc , has added Cuba to its website. And several airlines have said they are looking into adding flights.

Excluding certain items, the company earned $8.12 per diluted share.Analysts expected the company to earn $7.72 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue in the quarter was about $1.84 billion, against analysts' expectations for $1.8 billion.The company said it expects travel bookings in the second quarter to stay flat or grow up to 7 percent from a year earlier, as sales in foreign currencies translate into fewer U.S. dollars and ""significantly"" slow its pace of growth.""Foreign exchange had more of a negative impact that we thought and doesn't show any signs of easing up,"" said S&P Capital IQ analyst Tuna Amobi. Priceline Group's forecast assumes that the euro is 19 percent weaker and the British pound is 11 percent weaker than a year ago. Accounting for these fluctuations, travel bookings would be up 15 to 22 percent, the company said.The company expects to earn between $10.95 and $11.75 per share in the second quarter, excluding certain items, with revenue staying flat or rising up to 7 percent compared to a year earlier. It has greater exposure to foreign exchange volatility than rival Expedia Inc, with international bookings representing 88 percent of its total travel sales in the first quarter, compared to 41 percent for Expedia.Last week, Expedia affirmed earlier guidance for earnings growth as first-quarter bookings soared 19 percent.Priceline said travel bookings jumped 12 percent on the year in the first quarter, or 26 percent when accounting for currency fluctuations.The company's name-your-own-price feature, which allows customers to suggest a price they'd like to pay to travel, continued to shrink and hamper U.S. growth.""You have to question why they are still promoting that business,"" Amobi said.

82,"  Priceline Group Inc (PCLN.O) on Wednesday said its growth would slow in the second quarter as it spends more on marketing and as the timing of holidays shifts traveler bookings, sending shares down more than 7 percent in premarket trading. The lower forecast overshadowed a first-quarter profit that exceeded expectations at the world's most profitable online travel services company. Priceline Group, which operates Booking.com and other sites, earned $374 million in the first three months. Excluding special items, earnings jumped 24 percent from a year earlier to $532 million, or $10.54 per share. Analysts, on average, had expected $9.65 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The profit beat came as customers booked 31 percent more nights in hotels than a year earlier, with travel bookings up 21 percent overall, the company said. The early timing of the Easter holiday in part buoyed results.Still, Priceline's forecast that profit and bookings growth would slow concerned investors.  The company expects bookings to rise up to 18 percent in the second quarter, and to earn up to $12.50 per share on an adjusted basis. That's short of the 21 percent rise and $14.90 in earnings per share, respectively, that Cowen and Company analyst Kevin Kopelman said Priceline needed to forecast.""Gross bookings have continued to grow strongly across all channels and key geographic regions thus far in Q2, but growth has decelerated compared to Q1,"" Chief Financial Officer Daniel Finnegan said on an analyst call. ""We believe that the Eurocup and earlier timing this year for (the Muslim fasting month of) Ramadan will negatively impact our year-over-year growth rate in June."" Costs will also rise as the company said it plans to spend more on marketing to thwart competition from hotels offering discounts on their own websites to lure travelers from companies like Priceline, which charges a fee for listing their inventory.The weak forecast comes less than a week after Priceline said its Chief Executive Darren Huston had resigned after an investigation into a personal relationship with an employee that violated the company's code of conduct. S&P Capital IQ analyst Tuna Amobi said uncertainty about when Priceline would appoint a CEO replacement may have also hurt shares. Chairman and Interim CEO Jeffery Boyd said Priceline did not have a prediction for how long the search will take.

104,"   By Chikafumi Hodo | TOKYO, March 11  TOKYO, March 11 The head of New York-based Principal Global Investors said on Tuesday the $311 billion fund manager is looking into buying boutique asset management firms that invest in emerging markets and real estate to expand its portfolio of assetsPGI's chief executive, Jim McCaughan, said his firm, the asset management arm of Iowa-based financial services company Principal Financial Group Inc, hopes to finalise an acquisition, possibly in real estate, by the end of the year. He didn't identify potential targets.""It's hard to say, but I would be a little disappointed if we don't close at least one during the remainder of this year,"" McCaughan told Reuters in an interview. McCaughan is in Japan to meet clients.McCaughan said PGI, which bills itself as the 19th-largest pension manager in the United States, attaches more importance to doing the right deals than forcing the pace. PGI wants to acquire boutique fund management firms that invest in Europe and Asia as it already has strong presence in the United States, he said. A new acquisition would follow last year's purchase of London-based Liongate Capital Management, a hedge fund of funds  with assets of $1 billion. Boosted by inflows from equities, fixed income and real estate as well as the Liongate purchase, assets under management at PGI grew 10 percent last year.Emerging markets remain a focus for PGI, McCaughan said. While they may have appeared to look less attractive based on their performance over the past year, they continue to provide a strong long-term investment theme as middle-class populations grow in countries around the world, he said. ""We are actively looking not only at emerging, but at so-called 'frontier' markets, the smaller and newer markets. So that would be a second broader area and that would be fixed income or equities,"" he said.Currently, four asset management companies within the PGI group invest in fixed income or equities in emerging markets, with about $20 billion in assets in total. With regard to Japan, McCaughan said PGI is happy with its business in the world's third-largest economy, despite losing a mandate to manage foreign equities from the $1.26 trillion Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) last year.PGI has garnered more than 1 trillion yen ($10 billion) in assets over the last five years in Japan as institutional investors seek to diversify into foreign assets, such as U.S. high-yield bonds and international real estate investment trusts, he said.The firm also saw strong demand in international equities management from Japanese institutional investors in 2013, McCaughan said.",2014-03-11,PFG,"Tue Mar 11, 2014 | 3:38am EDT",Principal Global Investors CEO says firm seeking to acquire boutique asset managers,http://www.reuters.com//article/principal-finl-japan-idUSL3N0M71AF20140311?type=companyNews,0.9959,0.014,0.836,0.149

The revision in the company's Rating Outlook to Stable from Negative primarily  reflects diminishing concerns related to execution risk associated with PFG's  integration of AFP Cuprum S.A. (Cuprum), which it acquired in February 2013. To  date, the acquisition has exceeded expectations in terms of its contribution to  overall operating profitability. The revision in the Rating Outlook also  reflects a gradual decline in PFG's financial leverage. PFG's financial leverage was approximately 22.6% at March 31, 2014, down from a  recent high of 24.2% at Dec. 31, 2012 as the company issued debt to help fund  its acquisition of Cuprum. In the first quarter of 2014 (1Q'14), the company  redeemed the $100 million of surplus notes issued by Principal Life Insurance  Company (PLIC). As PLIC no longer has publicly-held debt outstanding, Fitch has  withdrawn the IDR of the company. In 1Q'14, PFG reported pre-tax operating earnings of $411 million, up from $304  million in 1Q'13. For the full year 2013, the company reported pre-tax operating  earnings of $1.4 billion, up from $1 billion in 2012. In addition to the  earnings contribution from Cuprum, the recent improvement in operating earnings  has been driven by higher fee-based revenue from growing account values and  tight expense management.  As a result of improving earnings, fixed charge coverage increased to  approximately 8.5x in 2013 from approximately 6.8x in 2012. In 1Q'14, fixed  charge coverage was 10.0x. While Fitch expects PFG to continue to generate  solid, stable earnings on its growing fee-based businesses, low market interest  rates, continued competitive pressures and less robust capital market conditions  are likely to restrain earnings growth in the intermediate term. PFG's strong capitalization is supported by the organization's primary insurance  operating company, PLIC, which reported a risk-based capital ratio (RBC) of 438%  at Dec. 31, 2013, up from 415% at year-end 2012. The company targets RBC in a  range of 415% to 425%, and Fitch expects the company to finish 2014 in that  range. Fitch considers PFG's allocation to direct mortgages to be above average  relative to the life insurance sector as a whole. In addition to $10.3 billion  in direct commercial loans and $1.2 billion in residential loans, the company  reported $4.1 billion in CMBS holdings at March 31, 2014. Although there has  been some recovery in these asset classes within the industry, Fitch views this  level of exposure to be a credit negative.  PFG, headquartered in Des Moines, IA, markets a range of retirement savings,  investment and insurance products and services primarily in the small- to  medium-sized business segment. The company reported consolidated assets of $211  billion, and total shareholders' equity of $10.1 billion at March 31, 2014. RATING SENSITIVITIES The key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Improved diversification of the company's sources of revenue and earnings; --Sustainable return on equity of 12% or higher and fixed-charge coverage above  12x; --Low volatility in earnings and capital over an extended period of time; --Financial leverage below 20%; --Reported RBC ratio above 475%. The key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include: --Run-rate return on equity below 10% and a GAAP-based fixed-charge coverage  ratio below 7x; --A decline in the company's reported RBC ratio to a level below 375%; --Increase in financial leverage to a level above 25% debt-to-total capital.

111,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, April 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Principal Financial Group,  Inc.'s (PFG) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. Fitch has also  affirmed the 'AA-' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of PFG's U.S.  operating subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Today's ratings affirmations reflect PFG's strong capitalization and stable,  balanced operating profitability, partially offset by above-average exposure to  direct mortgages and structured mortgage securities. PFG's financial leverage was 22% at Dec. 31, 2014, down from a recent high of  24.2% at Dec. 31, 2012 as the company issued debt to help fund its acquisition  of Administradora de Fondos de Pensiones Cuprum S.A. (Cuprum), a leading pension  manager in Chile. For full-year 2014, PFG reported pre-tax operating earnings of $1.7 billion,  continuing a gradual improvement from $1.4 million in 2013 and $1 billion in  2012. In addition to the earnings contribution from Cuprum, the recent  improvement in operating earnings has been driven by higher fee-based revenue  from growing account values and tight expense management. Fitch notes that the  company's operating performance exhibited significantly more stability relative  to many of its industry peers during the financial crisis. As a result of improving earnings, fixed charge coverage (FCC) increased to  approximately 10.4x in 2014 from approximately 8.5x in 2013 and 6.8x in 2012.  While Fitch expects PFG to continue to generate solid, stable earnings on its  growing fee-based businesses, low market interest rates, continued competitive  pressures and less robust capital market conditions are likely to restrain  earnings growth in the intermediate term. PFG's strong capitalization is supported by the organization's primary insurance  operating company, PLIC, which reported a risk-based capital ratio (RBC) of 423%  at Dec. 31, 2014, down from 439% at Dec. 31, 2013. The company targets  consolidated RBC in a range of 415% to 425%. Fitch considers PFG's allocation to direct mortgages to be above average  relative to the life insurance sector as a whole. In addition to $10.7 billion  in direct commercial loans and $1.1 billion in residential loans, the company  reported $4 billion in CMBS holdings at Dec. 31, 2014. Although there has been  significant recovery in these asset classes within the industry since the  financial crisis, Fitch views this level of exposure to be a credit negative.  PFG, headquartered in Des Moines, IA, markets a range of retirement savings,  investment and insurance products and services primarily in the small- to  medium-sized business segment. The company reported consolidated assets of $219  billion, and total shareholders' equity of $10.2 billion at Dec. 31, 2014. RATING SENSITIVITIES The key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Improved diversification of the company's sources of revenue and earnings; --Sustainable return on equity of 12% or higher and FCC above 12x; --Low volatility in earnings and capital over an extended period of time; --Financial leverage below 20%; --Reported RBC ratio above 475%.

112,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, May 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to Principal  Financial Group, Inc.'s (PFG) issuance of approximately $400 million of 10-year  senior unsecured notes. Fitch has also assigned a 'BBB' rating to PFG's issuance  of approximately $400 million of 40-year junior subordinated debentures. PFG's  Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is unaffected by this rating action. KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are guaranteed by Principal Financial Services, Inc., PFG's  intermediate holding company, whose Long-term IDR is currently 'A'. Fitch  affirmed the ratings of PFG and its insurance operating subsidiaries with a  Stable Outlook on April 13, 2015. Approximately $550 million of the proceeds from the issuance are expected to be  used to redeem PFG's series A non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock and  series B non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, with the remainder expected  to be used for general corporate purposes. PFG's ratings are supported by the company's strong competitive position in  several key markets and product lines, strong capitalization, and stable and  balanced earnings profile, partially offset by above-average exposure to direct  mortgages and structured mortgage securities. The company's recent operating  performance has been strong. Fitch expects PFG's financial leverage to increase on a pro forma basis to  approximately 27% from 21% at March 31, 2015, as a result of newly issued debt  and the pending redemption of the preferred stock. Whereas the existing  preferred stock receives full equity credit in accordance with Fitch's rating  criteria, the newly issued subordinated debt receives no equity credit. The  increase in financial leverage exceeds Fitch's rating tolerance of 25%. Fitch  expects financial leverage to decline to approximately 25% within the next 12  months. RATING SENSITIVITIES The key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Improved diversification of the company's sources of revenue and earnings; --Sustainable return on equity of 12% or higher and fixed-charge coverage above  12x; --Low volatility in earnings and capital over an extended period of time; --Financial leverage below 20%; --Reported RBC ratio above 475%. The key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include: --Run-rate return on equity below 10% and a GAAP-based fixed charge coverage  ratio below 7x; --A decline in the company's reported RBC ratio to a level below 375%; --Sustained increase in financial leverage to a level above 25%.

120,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 27 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Principal Financial  Group, Inc.'s (PFG) long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A'. Fitch has also  affirmed the 'AA-' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of PFG's U.S.  operating subsidiaries. The Rating Outlook is Stable.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Today's rating affirmations reflect PFG's strong capitalization and stable,  balanced operating profitability, partially offset by above-average exposure to  commercial real estate through direct mortgages, structured mortgage securities,  and direct real estate investments. PFG's strong capitalization is supported by the organization's primary insurance  operating company, PLIC, which reported a risk-based capital ratio (RBC) of 431%  at Dec. 31, 2015, up from 423% at Dec. 31, 2014. The company targets  consolidated RBC in a range of 415% to 425%. PFG's PRISM capital model score is  'Very Strong', which is within expectations for its current rating category. PFG's financial leverage was 27% at June 30, 2016, which is down from 29% at  year-end 2015 and above Fitch's expectation of 25%. The increase in financial  leverage was driven by a company debt issuance of $800 million in May 2015,  which was used to primarily refinance all of the company's outstanding preferred  stock. PFG's preferred stock had historically received full equity credit from  Fitch. While the company's financial leverage is currently above expectations  for its current rating category, Fitch expects leverage to return to  approximately 25% in the near term. Fitch expects the new fiduciary rules announced by the U.S. Department of Labor  (DOL) in April 2016 to have a relatively modest effect on PFG's overall sales  and profitability. While the rule will increase compliance costs for PFG and its  peers, Fitch believes PFG's diversification in terms of products, international  operations, and distribution will help mitigate the financial impact on the  broader organization.  PFG's ratings benefit from above-average historical earnings stability,  particularly in comparison to many of its peers during the financial crisis.  Fitch believes the company's earnings stability is due in part to PFG's business  mix, which is well diversified by product and geography. Over the last few  years, growth in fees from assets under management has been an offset to lower  investment income driven by persistently low interest rates. For the first half  of 2016, PFG reported pre-tax operating earnings of $788 million, down from $851  million for the same period in 2014. The decline in operating earnings was  driven primarily by weak first-quarter 2015 equity market performance.  Fitch considers PFG's allocation to direct mortgages to be above average  relative to the life insurance sector as a whole. In addition to $11.2 billion  in direct commercial loans and  $3.9 billion in CMBS holdings as of year-end 2015, the company also has direct  commercial real estate investments. Although these asset classes have largely  recovered since the financial crisis, Fitch views this level of exposure to be a  credit negative. PFG's investment portfolio continued to perform within  expectations as the company's realized investment losses remained at manageable  levels in 2015 and through the first nine months of 2016.  PFG, headquartered in Des Moines, IA, markets a range of retirement savings,  investment and insurance products and services primarily in the small- to  medium-sized business segment. The company reported consolidated assets of $223  billion, and total shareholders' equity of $10.6 billion at June 30, 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Improved diversification of the company's sources of revenue and earnings; --Sustainable return on equity of 12% or higher and fixed-charge coverage above  12x; --Low volatility in earnings and capital over an extended period of time; --Financial leverage below 20%; --A PRISM capital model score of 'Extremely Strong'. Conversely, key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include: --Run-rate return on equity below 10% and a GAAP-based fixed-charge coverage  ratio below 7x; --A decline in the company's reported RBC ratio to a level below 375% or a PRISM  capital model score below 'Strong'; --Sustained increase in financial leverage to a level above 25%.

121,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, November 04 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A-' rating to  Principal Financial Group, Inc.'s (PFG) issuances of $350 million of 10-year  senior unsecured notes and $300 million of 30-year senior unsecured notes. PFG's  Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) is unaffected by this rating action. KEY RATING DRIVERS The notes are guaranteed by Principal Financial Services, Inc., PFG's  intermediate holding company, whose Long-Term IDR is currently 'A'. Fitch  affirmed the ratings of PFG and its insurance operating subsidiaries with a  Stable Outlook on Oct. 27, 2016. The proceeds from the new senior unsecured debt issuances will be used to  refinance two of PFG's existing debt issuances: $300 million 1.85% notes due  November 2017 and $350 million 8.875% notes due May 2019. PFG is expected to  tender all of the outstanding 2017 and 2019 debt issuances simultaneously with  the close of the new debt issuance. In addition to the tender of the 2017 and  2019 debt, PFG expects to partially tender up to $150 million of outstanding  6.05% senior notes due 2036. PFG's ratings reflect the company's strong capitalization and stable, balanced  operating profitability, partially offset by above-average exposure to  commercial real estate through direct mortgages, structured mortgage securities,  and direct real estate investments. PFG's strong capitalization is supported by the organization's primary insurance  operating company, PLIC, which reported a risk-based capital ratio (RBC) of 431%  at Dec. 31, 2015. The company targets consolidated RBC in a range of 415% to  425%. PFG's PRISM capital model score is 'Very Strong', which is within  expectations for its current rating category.  The company's recent operating performance has remained stable. PFG's pre-tax  operating earnings were approximately $1.2 billion for the first three quarters  of 2016, relatively flat from the same period prior year, as weaker results from  first quarter 2016 equity market performance was largely offset by strong  performance in subsequent quarters. Fitch expects PFG's financial leverage to decline on a pro forma basis to  approximately 25.5% from 26.4% as of Sept. 30, 2016 as a result of the new debt  issuance and simultaneous tenders of existing debt. Although PFG's pro forma  financial leverage still slightly exceeds Fitch's rating tolerance of 25%, Fitch  expects financial leverage to decrease to 25% by year-end 2016. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Improved diversification of the company's sources of revenue and earnings; --Sustainable return on equity of 12% or higher and fixed-charge coverage above  12x; --Low volatility in earnings and capital over an extended period of time; --Financial leverage below 20%; --A PRISM capital model score of 'Extremely Strong'. Conversely, key rating triggers that could result in a downgrade include: --Run-rate return on equity below 10% and a GAAP-based fixed-charge coverage  ratio below 7x; --A decline in the company's reported RBC ratio to a level below 375% or a PRISM  capital model score of 'Strong'; --Sustained increase in financial leverage to a level above 25%. Fitch has assigned the following ratings: Principal Financial Group, Inc.  --$350 million 3.1% senior notes due Nov. 15, 2026 at 'A-'; --$300 million 4.3% senior notes due Nov. 15, 2046 at 'A-'.

The Fed's policymakers will conclude a two-day meeting on Wednesday.A rout in emerging market assets spread to developed countries in Europe on worries over Fed policy, slowing growth in China and political problems in Turkey, Argentina and Ukraine. Worries over China's growth emerged after a disappointing manufacturing number spurred the S&P 500 to a 0.9 percent fall on Thursday.The Turkish lira hit a fresh record low and the South African rand a new five-year low against the dollar.U.S.-listed shares of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, S.A.  slumped 5.3 percent to $12.01.Shares of the Spanish bank with heavy exposure to Latin America fell a day after Argentina's peso suffered its steepest daily decline in 12 years, prompting Argentina's government to loosen strict foreign exchange controls. ""It's just the final realization that they can't continue to grow as an economy the same way they did before,"" said Andres Garcia-Amaya, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds, in New York.""It's a combination of less liquidity for these countries that depended on foreign money, and China kind of throwing some curveballs as well.""Benchmark 10-year Treasuries notes were up 11/32 in price with a yield of 2.735 percent. Argentina's government said Friday it would loosen strict foreign exchange controls, after it abandoned its long-standing policy of intervening to support the peso currency. That resulted in the currency's steepest plunge since the 2002 financial crisis.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 124.39 points or 0.77 percent, to 16,072.96, the S&P 500 lost 15.26 points or 0.83 percent, to 1,813.2 and the Nasdaq Composite  dropped 38.212 points or 0.91 percent, to 4,180.663.The S&P 500 is down 1.3 percent for the week.

134,"  By Phil WahbaJan 24 Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, reported a dip in quarterly profit on Friday as its push in emerging markets led to a lower gross profit margin.Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller told reporters on a conference call that sales in emerging markets had risen 8 percent during the second quarter, easily outpacing developed markets, where sales barely edged up.But P&G's gross margin is lower in those markets as the company establishes itself. Still, the costs are worth paying, said one investor.""The emerging markets are definitely the future for P&G,"" said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, which manages about $11 billion and has long owned P&G and Kimberly-Clark Corp shares. P&G's Moeller said its market shares in both emerging and developed sectors had held steady.Earlier this weak, rival Unilever  said it would stick to its emerging markets growth strategy as a fourth-quarter recovery in sales there boosted 2013 results.P&G's gross profit margin slipped 0.9 percentage points, in part because of stagnant sales of its beauty products, which have higher margins. The margins were helped by lower manufacturing costs. P&G, the maker of Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, left its 2014 forecasts unchanged. It still expects organic sales, which strip out the impact of currency changes as well as acquisitions and divestitures, to rise 3 percent to 4 percent, and core earnings to rise 5 percent to 7 percent.""It is reassuring to see it has confidence it can hit the numbers, despite the weak categories,"" J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher wrote in a note. The company's beauty division continued to struggle during the quarter, with organic sales unchanged as skin care results slipped. P&G's health care segment reported the fastest growth, rising 5 percent.The company earned $3.43 billion, or $1.18 per share, in its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31, down from $4.06 billion, or $1.39 per share, a year earlier. Core earnings per share, excluding restructuring charges, fell 1 percent to $1.21.

137,"   By Soyoung Kim and Olivia Oran | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Jan 31 Merck & Co Inc has received approaches from large consumer companies interested in buying its consumer healthcare business, best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine, according to people familiar with the matter.Merck's consumer healthcare business, which also includes Dr. Scholl's foot care and other consumer products, could be worth as much as $8 billion to $10 billion in a sale, or roughly four to five times the unit's annual revenue, some of the people said.Merck, the No. 2 U.S. drugmaker after Pfizer Inc, is considering alternatives for both its consumer and animal health businesses and has said it expects to complete the review in 2014.Among a range of options it has considered for the consumer unit, Merck discussed a potential asset swap with Novartis AG , under which Merck would give up its consumer assets in return for the Swiss drugmaker's animal health and other units, Reuters and others previously reported.The probability of carrying out such a deal, however, is currently seen as low due to the complexity of valuing different businesses, prompting Merck to explore an outright sale of its consumer unit as well, people familiar with the matter said.Merck has been in conversations with several interested parties and is being advised by Morgan Stanley on the process, the people said, asking not to be named because the conversations are private. For its much larger animal health unit, the second-largest in the industry after Zoetis Inc, Merck is evaluating the potential of spinning it off as a separate publicly traded company, people familiar with the matter said.Analysts and people familiar with the industry say big consumer companies such as Reckitt Benckiser Group and Procter & Gamble Co could be logical buyers for Merck's consumer healthcare business.Reckitt already owns over-the-counter medicines including Mucinex and Nurofen and the international rights for the Scholl foot care business. Its chief executive told Reuters in a September interview that Reckitt aimed to be a major player in consumer healthcare and has the firepower to do sizeable deals. Procter & Gamble Co also has a portfolio that includes a range of medicines and beauty products.Reckitt and P&G declined to comment.Johnson & Johnson is the biggest player in the $200 billion global consumer health industry, with about 4 percent of the market, followed by Bayer AG and GlaxoSmithKline Plc. Merck, however, is relatively small with around 1 percent of the market. Merck has said in the past that it views its consumer business as sub-scale.In considering options for the consumer and animal health businesses, Merck is following in the footsteps of other drugmakers such as Pfizer Inc, which created shareholder value by seperating non-core assets.Pfizer sold its infant-nutrition business to Nestle SA  for $11.9 billion in 2012, and last year spun off its animal health unit as a separate publicly traded company called Zoetis.Many other drugmakers have been looking to shed businesses, prompted by pricing pressure and increasing competition that has forced a more rigorous approach to capital allocation. They have shown a new willingness to consider whether other companies may be better owners for certain assets.A Merck spokeswoman declined to comment on details of the strategic review. Morgan Stanley did not respond to requests for comment.",2014-01-31,PG,"Fri Jan 31, 2014 | 1:58pm EST",Merck gets buyout interest for consumer health unit -sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/merck-unit-idUSL2N0L50N520140131?type=companyNews,0.9833,0.021,0.895,0.084
138,"   By Dhanya Skariachan | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the world's largest household products maker, cut its sales and earnings outlook for the year on Tuesday to reflect unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Venezuela and the devaluation of currencies in various developing markets.The changed outlook reflects the recent devaluation against the dollar of the Argentine peso, Turkish lira, South African rand, Russian ruble, Ukrainian hryvnia, Brazilian real and several other currencies, said P&G, whose products include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent.For U.S. companies that do substantial business in developing countries, the devaluations cause their earnings in those currencies to be worth less when converted back to dollars. Procter & Gamble said it now sees growth in core earnings per share of 3 percent to 5 percent, down from its prior outlook for growth of 5 to 7 percent. It also revised its forecast for sales growth to a range of flat to a rise of 2 percent versus its prior forecast for growth in a range of 1 to 2 percent.Procter & Gamble shares dipped 0.5 percent to $78.45 in after-market trading on Tuesday, after closing up 1.4 percent at $78.84 in regular trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. dollar is expected to make steady gains against major currencies this year as a recovery in the world's largest economy gains steam and gives the Federal Reserve room to wind down its stimulus program. Plunging emerging market currencies have forced many global companies to hedge foreign currency exposure more aggressively and raise prices frequently.Automaker Ford Motor Co. (F.N), appliance maker Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) and liquor giant Diageo (DGE.L) all cited weakness and a more sober outlook in once-roaring emerging markets in earnings reports last month.(Reporting by Dhanya Skariachan; Editing by Leslie Adler and Tom Brown)",2014-02-11,PG,"Tue Feb 11, 2014 | 5:34pm EST",Procter & Gamble cuts outlook on emerging market currency impact,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-procterandgamble-outlook-idUSBREA1A26V20140211?type=companyNews,0.8692,0.034,0.889,0.076

Europe is one of China's largest trading partners. MSCI's index of emerging market stocks added 0.9 percent , extending a bounce from five-month lows hit earlier this month.""Emerging markets look like they're beginning to find their footing. I believe we're back to viewing the global economy being in a glass-half-full expansion,"" said Eric Teal, chief investment officer at First Citizens Bancshares Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina, which manages $3.5 billion.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.83 points, or 0.19 percent, to 15,963.94; the S&P 500  lost 0.49 points, or 0.03 percent, to 1,819.26; and the Nasdaq Composite added 10.243 points, or 0.24 percent, to 4,201.288. Procter & Gamble shares lost 1.7 percent to $77.49 and weighed on both the Dow and S&P 500 after the company cut its sales and earnings growth outlooks for the year to reflect unfavorable foreign exchange rates in Venezuela and the devaluation of currencies in various developing markets.The lackluster move in U.S. stocks followed a rally on Tuesday after the U.S. House of Representatives voted to suspend the debt limit until March 2015 and the Federal Reserve's new chief, Janet Yellen, held off from making any changes to the central bank's schedule for trimming stimulus.The debt ceiling deal pressured U.S. bond prices for a second day, though. Benchmark 10-year Treasuries  were down 13/32 in price to yield 2.76 percent.

149,"   By Martinne Geller | LONDON  LONDON As a slowdown in emerging markets takes the shine off shares in consumer goods makers like Nestle NESN.VX, Unilever (ULVR.L), Danone (DANO.PA) and Procter & Gamble (PG.N), hungry investors have been sampling more of the companies that supply them.Scent and flavor makers such as Symrise (SY1G.DE), Givaudan GIVN.VX and International Flavors & Fragrances (IFF.N), and food ingredient names like Glanbia (GL9.I) and Kerry Group (KYGa.I) are attractive, analysts say, because they're more resistant to weak consumer spending and benefit from health and wellness trends forcing so many brands to modify their products.""The companies in those segments have exposure to faster growing specialty areas, serve a wide range of customers (from top brands to white label) and constantly invest in new technology,"" Berenberg analysts said this month. They upgraded Germany's Symrise to ""buy"" and Switzerland's Givaudan to ""hold"".JPMorgan Cazenove estimates the European food ingredients sector on average will see 6 percent earnings growth in 2014, while European food producers will see no growth.Indeed, consumer staples stocks have been battered by currency devaluations and cooling demand in emerging markets and lingering economic malaise in Europe and the United States. Over the past 12 months, the top 25 global consumer staples stocks are still up 7.5 percent on average, but down 3.5 percent in the year to date, according to Reuters data.By contrast, 2014 has favored ingredients. At Thursday's close Kerry was up 3 percent, IFF 5 percent, Symrise 6 percent and Givaudan 9 percent.Still, there are outliers. Lower European sugar prices are squeezing profits at German sugar company Suedzucker (SZUG.DE), while Britain's Tate & Lyle (TATE.L) on Thursday forecast sharply lower prices for its Splenda sweetener due to competition from cheaper Chinese sucralose makers. Both companies' shares are down by double digits.""There are some very, very good businesses in that space, but I don't think you can just bundle them all together, as you can see with Tate & Lyle,"" said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Jeff Stent. ""If you take a stock like Kerry, we've been buyers of that stock for as long as we've been analysts at Exane."" EQUAL OPPORTUNITY SUPPLIER In developed markets, makers of everything from beer to bread to bodywash have lost some ground to generic, white-label products. But for the ingredients makers, those brands are customers. And in less mature markets, the growing customer base is local manufacturers.Kerry Group's deal to supply dairy ingredients to Chinese infant nutrition company Beingmate shows how the sector can benefit from the development of local players who are stepping up their game against multinationals. Companies like Natura Cosmeticos (NATU3.SA) from Brazil and Grupo Bimbo (BIMBOA.MX) from Mexico are just two developing market consumer companies actively expanding into new markets.Analysts at Davy Research who follow the sector say that as local manufacturers get bigger and more savvy, they are turning to internationals for more reliable and high-quality supply. That is especially true in China, where a 2008 scandal involving tainted milk made consumers wary of local brands.China's top milk producer, China Mengniu Dairy (2319.HK), this week agreed to sell more of itself to Danone as it tries to win customers. Denmark's Arla Foods ARLAF.UL, another dairy supplier, also has a stake in Mengniu. <ID:L3N0LH37V>HEALTHY INNOVATION The average consumer goods maker spends about 8 to 10 percent or more of its sales on advertising and marketing and just 2 percent on research and development. Over time, R&D spending has come down as categories mature and companies cut costs, leaving them to outsource technical development to their suppliers. ""I think they have always been marketing companies,"" said JPMorgan analyst John Faucher. ""As the technologies and categories become more complicated, they simply need to cast a broader net.""By contrast, flavor and fragrance companies often spend more than 7 percent of sales on R&D, and have been buying smaller makers of specialized ingredients for which they can charge higher prices and boost margins.""They want your M&M to be the right blue and for the melt characteristics to be exactly right,"" said a banker who has advised on deals in the sector. ""They're not trying to sell flour to bakers.""Last year, Tate & Lyle bought a maker of oat beta glucan, and in January IFF bought a maker of complex specialty ingredients, while Symrise is trying to take over Sweden's Probi (PROB.ST), which makes probiotic ingredients for yoghurt. Israel's Frutarom Industries (FRUT.TA) has bought 12 companies since 2011.A technical arsenal is handy as brands yield to more pressure to make their goods healthier or more natural. This month alone, Kraft Foods KRFT.O removed an artificial preservative from its Singles cheese, and U.S. Subway restaurants removed a chemical from its bread found in rubber yoga mats. A U.S. Senator has since called on regulators to ban the chemical.In that light, Tom Pirko of Bevmark Consulting said ingredients companies that are entrepreneurial and creative write their own tickets.""Those who foresee the future, are generally big winners.""(Editing by Will Waterman)",2014-02-14,PG,"Fri Feb 14, 2014 | 7:42am EST",No appetite for big consumer goods?

150,"   By Nadia Damouni, Olivia Oran and Phil Wahba | NEW YORK  NEW YORK Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) is considering current and former executives of the world's largest household products maker as it begins the search for candidates to succeed Chairman and Chief Executive A.G. Lafley, according to sources familiar with the situation.P&G veterans being considered as part of the succession planning process include Fabrizio Freda, who spent two decades at the company before becoming CEO of Estee Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N); and Susan Arnold, former president of global business units who is now an operating partner at private equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O).Lafley is also closely watching the performance of some of his other direct reports for their potential to succeed him, the sources said.These executives include Melanie Healey, group president of North America; David Taylor, group president of global home care; and Deborah Henretta, group president of global beauty care; Martin Riant, the group president of global baby care; and Giovanni Ciserani, the group president of global fabric care.P&G declined on Thursday to comment or to make executives available for interviews.No formal search process is currently under way, and the sources said Lafley could stay on for some time to come.Lafley, 66, was previously P&G's CEO from 2000 to 2009, but came out of retirement after his successor, Bob McDonald, was abruptly replaced last year amid pressure from investors who worried about its growth prospects and lagging share price.Since taking the helm, Lafley has conducted a ""deep dive"" to figure out what needs fixing. He re-organized P&G into four businesses to boost efficiency. Last year, he said the fiscal 2014 year would be a transition year, with fiscal 2013 a ""stepping stone.""In a telephone interview with Reuters last week, Freda declined to say whether he had been approached by the P&G board. But he said, ""I'm very happy at Estee Lauder Cos, and that's what I'm doing and that's what I am focused on and that's what I plan to continue doing."" A representative for Arnold declined to comment.These new details about P&G's succession planning process suggest that the company, whose products including Tide detergent, Gillette razors and Pampers diapers are household names, is leaning toward choosing one of its own to be the nextCEO. The sources said the appeal of hiring a former or current executive is that they would not only understand the complexities of a large multinational company with dozens of products but also understand its culture.Gary Stibel, founder and CEO of New England Consulting Group and a former P&G executive, said the company is unlikely to select a candidate with no ties to it. ""It is totally unnecessary, because they have so much internal talent competing for that job that it will be a challenge to select one,"" Stibel said.P&G has traditionally chosen CEOs and other top executives from within its management ranks. In 2009, Lafley picked McDonald, who was the chief operating officer at the time, to take over the company.McDonald struggled with a pullback in consumer spending in the aftermath of the financial crisis and the recession. In early 2012, he unveiled a $10 billion restructuring program, cutting thousands of jobs and taking other steps to improve operations, launch new products and expand into fast-growing emerging markets.Investors wanted faster improvements. Activist investor William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management took a $2 billion stake in P&G and began pushing for changes, saying shares were undervalued. (Ackman has since sold at least part of its stake.) P&G shares underperformed those of rivals between the time McDonald was appointed in June 2009 and the announcement of his departure. During that time, P&G rose about 50 percent, while Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N), for example, was up 74 percent and Standard & Poor's 500 .SPX index advanced 75 percent.""Bob retired, the board called me and I felt like duty called,"" Lafley said in an interview when he returned in May 2013.Consultants and recruiters said they expect Lafley to remain in the top seat at P&G for at least another 12 to 18 months.""It is still early. These changes don't happen overnight. I think investors have a lot of confidence in him,"" said Jason Tauber, an analyst for Neuberger Berman's large cap disciplined growth team. Neuberger owns about 7 million P&G shares.But as Lafley and the board consider a potential successor, they have to contend with investors increasingly eager to see what moves P&G will make to speed up growth.Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel, said shedding some business and making further progress on cost-cutting would help P&G.""Procter is doing just fine - but when you look at their other competitors who have been able to surpass P&G, the reason is they're more nimble and they're more adroit in adapting to shifts in consumer patterns,"" said McCormick.Bahl & Gaynor owned 4.2 million P&G shares as of September, according to Thomson Reuters data.(Editing by Paritosh Bansal and Ken Wills)",2014-02-14,PG,"Thu Feb 13, 2014 | 7:37pm EST","Exclusive: P&G eyes alumni, unit heads as candidates for CEO job",http://www.reuters.com//article/us-proctergamble-ceo-idUSBREA1D00S20140214?type=companyNews,0.9968,0.029,0.856,0.115
151,"   By John Wasik | CHICAGO  CHICAGO With U.S. stocks doing a stutter-step after a five-year bull run, a shift into low-volatility funds might give you a little more traction if the market retrenches.Low or ""minimum"" volatility funds have become more popular since the 2008 meltdown. Buying mostly defensive stocks with high dividends and modest price variations, they represent an $11 billion market for moderately risk-averse investors.The most popular fund in this category, the PowerShares S&P 500 Low-Volatility ETF, holds more than $3 billion in assets. It owns brand-name stocks like McDonald's Corp and Johnson & Johnson, along with lesser-known companies like Sigma-Aldrich Corp.The fund, which charges 0.25 percent for annual management expenses, was up 14 percent for the year ended February 12.A similar fund is the iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility ETF, which with slightly more than $2 billion in assets is a runner-up in terms of size in this group. It holds nearly half of its portfolio in consumer defensive, healthcare and financial services stocks like AT&T Inc, Wal-Mart Stores Inc and United Parcel Service Inc.The fund charges slightly less in annual expenses - 0.15 percent - and gained about 16 percent in the year through February 12. But both it and the PowerShares ETF are lagging the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, which is up 22 percent for that period.Although it is too early to tell, low-volatility funds might have a distinct advantage if the bull cycle has reached or surpassed its peak.If corporate earnings falter or global economies slow, the market may tilt toward value and dividend-rich stocks. To date, though, the low-volatility advantage has yet to appear. Both the S&P 500 and low-volatility shares are closely tracking each other, down slightly more than 1 percent year to date as of February 12.DIVIDENDS WORTH GRABBING Despite the desire to time the top of a bull market, it is tough to make an exit from growth stocks into high-dividend shares. Market peaks are notoriously difficult to discern.The most pressing question for a long-term investor is whether to tilt more toward value than growth. Until this year, growth stocks have had their run of the roost, but value may dominate if fear stalks the market. It is typical for low-volatility funds to bulk up on boring, dividend-rich sectors like consumer durable, healthcare and utilities.The PowerShares fund, for example, has nearly half of its portfolio in those three groups. Both it and the iShares fund have yields north of 2 percent, which reflect the higher payouts of those kinds of companies.Yet what appears to be a virtue can be a disadvantage, particularly if the bull has room to run and the market will still favor growth stocks.By their very staid nature, low-volatility funds may not outpace the S&P 500, which rose 32 percent last year with dividends reinvested, compared with 25 percent for the iShares fund. Instead of trying to guess where the market is going and reacting week to week, a dividend-growth strategy might prove potent in the long run. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index ETF, which I hold in my 401(k), lagged the S&P 500 by only about 1 percentage point over the past three years.The Vanguard fund, which focuses on companies that consistently raise their dividends, is slightly more diversified than the other low-volatility funds I have mentioned. Its portfolio is more spread out among mega-, large- and medium-size companies with holdings like Abbott Laboratories, Procter & Gamble Co and PepsiCo Inc. It costs only 0.10 percent annually to own and was up 16 percent for the year ended February 12.Companies paying lower but growing dividends may also be bargains, Matt Freund, chief investment officer of USAA Funds in San Antonio, stated in a recent market commentary.""Companies increasing their dividend payments are making a commitment to the market,"" Freund said. ""They are telling investors that their business is strong enough to generate the free cash needed to pay higher dividends in the future.""Whatever path you take, do not confuse low-volatility funds with no volatility. All low-volatility stock funds will still react to market swoons. The Vanguard fund, for example, was down more than 3 percent year to date through February 12, compared with a 1.3 percent decline for the S&P 500.Concentrating too much on defensive stocks will certainly create a drag on performance if growth still dominates, but that may not be a bad thing if you want to focus on total return over the long haul.(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)(Editing by Lauren Young and Lisa Von Ahn)",2014-02-18,PG,"Tue Feb 18, 2014 | 7:26am EST",Boring might be better for fund investors in 2014,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-column-wasik-volatility-idUSBREA1H0T220140218?type=companyNews,0.9937,0.041,0.84,0.12

154,"   By Paul Sandle | LONDON  LONDON Procter & Gamble Co is bringing the dentist into the bathroom with the world's first smartphone-connected toothbrush, a device that gives personalized advice to help people improve their brushing.The toothbrush, to be sold under P&G's Oral-B brand and which will be widely available from June, has a Bluetooth 4.0 link to a smartphone app that can be programmed with the help of a dentist, for example to pay more attention to any areas of the mouth being neglected, P&G said.""The app provides real-time guidance,"" Michael Cohen-Dumani, global associate director for Oral-B, told Reuters.""Dentists always tell us: 'People do a great job in the week before they come to visit us and in the week after they visit us. But nothing can hide the fact that when we look inside the mouth we can see all the areas they miss'."" The toothbrush will be unveiled at the phone industry's annual Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona next week, joining an expanding range of devices connected to smartphones that measure everything from sleep patterns and calorie intake to distance walked and exercise taken.Professionals had helped develop the app as a tool to manage their patients' behavior between visits, Cohen-Dumani said. The app displays brushing progress in real time, telling the user when to move to a different part of the mouth and warning if they are brushing too hard, he said. ""It will guide you in terms of how to brush, and you will be able to fully personalize the brushing routine for you,"" Cohen-Dumani said.In tests, the app had extended average brushing times from less than a minute for a manual toothbrush to 2 minutes and 16 seconds, he said.

The Nasdaq fell below its 50-day moving average earlier, in a sign of weakening near-term momentum.Netflix Inc tumbled 6.7 percent to close at $378.90, with fellow Internet names Facebook Inc down 4.7 percent at $64.10 and TripAdvisor Inc down 3.9 percent at $97.58. All three had scored sharp gains in 2013. The Nasdaq biotechnology index, which jumped 66 percent last year, fell 3 percent in its fourth straight daily decline. Over those four sessions, the biotech index slid 9 percent. On Friday, the index marked its worst day since October 2011.""Biotech stocks have gone parabolic over the past few months, so this is a necessary correction to that,"" said Mark D'Cruz, senior investment analyst at Key Private Bank in Cleveland, Ohio.""A lot of that interest came from outside traditional biotech investors, who are now being scared off ... Biotechs really have to prove themselves this year, prove that their drugs can deliver.""Ukraine announced the evacuation of its troops from Crimea, essentially yielding the region to Russian forces, which seized a Ukrainian marine base. While few U.S. companies have excessive exposure to the region, investors are concerned about the potential economic fallout from any escalation in tensions. U.S. President Barack Obama, who has imposed personal sanctions against some of Russian President Vladimir Putin's political and business allies, began crisis talks with his European allies over how to respond in the biggest East-West conflict since the Cold War.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 26.08 points or 0.16 percent, to end at 16,276.69. The S&P 500 dropped 9.08 points or 0.49 percent, to finish at 1,857.44. The Nasdaq Composite slid 50.403 points or 1.18 percent, to close at 4,226.385.""The S&P 500 is having a difficult time moving past its existing highs around 1,880. While the level represents a stunning rally of approximately 180 percent from the bottom set in March 2009, investors should be aware of the resistance the market is currently facing,"" said Dan McElwee, executive vice president of Ventura Wealth Management in Ewing, New Jersey.On the New York Stock Exchange, decliners beat advancers by 1,924 to 1,142. On the Nasdaq, 1,960 stocks fell and 673 shares rose. The CBOE Volatility Index or the VIX, a widely used gauge of investor sentiment on Wall Street, rose 0.6 percent, but was still relatively subdued, at 15.09.The Dow's losses were limited by a rise in Procter & Gamble Co, a consumer staple considered a defensive play. It rose 1.8 percent to $79.30, snapping a four-day losing streak.In the latest snapshot of the U.S. economy, financial data firm Markit said its preliminary read on March manufacturing activity slowed after nearing a four-year high last month. Markit, however, said the rate of growth and the pace of hiring remained strong.""For now, the U.S. economy continues to plug along, if not particularly robustly, then apparently well enough to keep markets happy,"" said Jerry Webman, chief economist at OppenheimerFunds in New York.Herbalife Ltd said it would allow three more representatives of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, the company's biggest shareholder, to join its board. Shares of the nutrition and weight-loss company jumped 6.7 percent to $52.86.NU Skin Enterprises Inc shares soared 18.2 percent to $88.66 on heavy volume. China fined the company $540,000 for illegal product sales and misleading local consumers, a smaller penalty than expected.Volume of about 6.4 billion shares traded on U.S. exchanges, slightly below the 6.9 billion average so far this month, according to data from BATS Global Markets.

And just earlier on Wednesday, privately held Mars announced a $2.9 billion deal to acquire Procter & Gamble Co's pet food business, which includes brands like Iams and Eukanuba. Founded in 2006, Freshpet makes fresh, refrigerated food for dogs and cats as an alternative to dry or canned food. Freshpet's products, available at stores including Target Corp  and Wal-Mart Stores Inc, do not have preservatives, fillers, corn or wheat.Private equity firm MidOcean Partners made what it referred to as a ""significant investment"" in Freshpet in 2011, joining Tyson Foods Inc, which had been a strategic partner of Freshpet since 2009. The sources asked not to be identified because Freshpet's IPO plans are confidential. MidOcean, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse declined to comment. Freshpet and Tyson Foods did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Freshpet's sales are expected to top $100 million this year from just $500,000 in 2006, CEO Richard Thompson was cited as saying in an interview with a local newspaper last month.

The non-profit organisation calls for men to grow moustaches during the month of November to raise awareness of men's health issues, such as prostate cancer. P&G's Gillette planned to start shipping the new razor, called ProGlide FlexBall, on June 9, the WSJ said, quoting marketing documents. The razor's ball hinge allows the blade to pivot and can lead to missing about 20 percent less hair with each glide. P&G will offer manual and battery-powered versions of the FlexBall for suggested prices of $11.49 and $12.59 with one ProGlide cartridge, the report said.The company has a $188 million sales target for FlexBall for the first year.

171,"   By Sophie Sassard and Soyoung Kim | LONDON/NEW YORK  LONDON/NEW YORK German drugmaker Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) is nearing an agreement to buy Merck & Co Inc's (MRK.N) consumer healthcare unit, people familiar with the matter said, in a deal that could value the business at around $14 billion.Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB.L), one of the final contenders in the auction, said on Wednesday it was no longer in active talks to buy the Merck business, leaving Bayer in the pole position to win the asset, which is best known for Coppertone sunscreen and Claritin allergy medicine. Bayer and Merck are hammering out final terms of an agreement and could announce the transaction in the next several days, the people said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. Representatives for Bayer and Merck declined to comment.Reuters first reported last week that Bayer and Reckitt had emerged as forerunners in the auction with each offering roughly $13.5 billion, a price that could come close to $14 billion when the deal is finalized.. Bloomberg News reported on Thursday that Bayer entered exclusive talks with Merck. Bayer has also edged out other rival bidders in the auction, including Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), Boehringer Ingelheim, Novartis AG NOVN.VX and Sanofi SA (SASY.PA), people familiar with the matter said.(Reporting by Sophie Sassard in London and Soyoung Kim in New York; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)",2014-05-01,PG,"Thu May 1, 2014 | 3:26pm EDT",Bayer nears deal to buy Merck consumer unit: sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-merck-consumer-idUSBREA400SO20140501?type=companyNews,0.9666,0.009,0.881,0.11
172,"  * Second acquisition for Henkel this week* Henkel says more deals possible* Both deals expand position in existing categories, markets   (Adds details on BC Partners, background, context, byline)By Victoria Bryan and Martinne GellerFRANKFURT/LONDON, June 5 Henkel & Co  plans to buy French household cleaner maker Spotless, for 940 million euros ($1.28 billion) cash, its second purchase in a week as the German consumer goods company builds its presence in large, profitable, mature markets.Henkel is buying Spotless from London-based private equity firm BC Partners, adding Eau Ecarlate and Dylon laundry products to a portfolio that already includes Persil detergent, Loctite adhesives and Schwarzkopf hair products.Spotless will give it leading positions in established markets like France, Italy and Britain where home and personal care products enjoy relatively fat profit margins, Henkel said. The global consumer goods sector is seeing a spate of deals as tough economic conditions are leading small and mid-sized firms to seek entry into new markets or greater scale in existing, mature markets.Henkel's latest acquisition follows a 270 million euros ($367.78 million) deal on Monday, to buy three U.S. hair care brands. Both purchases are being funded by a 4 billion euro ($5.45 billion) war chest the company has been building over several quarters for acquisitions.Henkel had been shopping for takeover targets for well over a year as a way to stay competitive in a consolidating consumer goods market increasingly fuelled by emerging markets. By 2016 it aims to have 20 billion euros in sales, up from 16.4 billion in 2013, with half of that coming from emerging markets.The price paid for Spotless, which includes debt, represents a multiple of 3.4 times sales and 12.1 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). That is higher than the 10 times sales and 1.7 times EBITDA Unilever  paid in 2010 for laundry and personal care brands from Sara Lee. Henkel itself trades for about 13.5 times EBITDA and has a market value of about $47 billion. ""The acquisition seems to be rather expensive, but high valuation is justified, due to low volatility business profile and the emerging opportunity to increase market share in the highly competitive Western European laundry market,"" wrote Equinet Bank analysts in a research note.According to Euromonitor International, the deal would slightly lift Henkel's share of the $82 billion global laundry care market to 8.7 percent, still well behind Procter & Gamble's  26.6 percent and Unilever's 14.8 percent. Unilever sells Persil detergent in some markets.Consumer giants like Unilever, Nestle and Procter & Gamble are also taking advantage of high valuations to prune their portfolios and sharpen their focus on their most profitable businesses. Recent weeks have seen a bidding war for U.S. sausage maker Hillshire Brands, Japan's Mizkan Group buying Unilever's Ragu pasta sauce, Mars Inc buying P&G's pet food unit, L'Oreal  buying Chinese beauty mask maker Magic Holdings, and Emperador from the Philippines buying the Whyte & Mackay Scotch whisky business from United Spirits, controlled by Diageo.Despite Henkel's deals this week, there could still be more, said a spokesman for the company, which pre-empted an auction for Spotless with an offer, according to a source close to the deal.BC Partners made a return of 2 times its original investment, according to the source. BC bought Spotless from Ardian, formerly Axa Private Equity, in 2010 for 640 million euros including debt. It has not taken any dividends from its investment, said the source.The deal is subject to approval by antitrust authorities and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2015. Henkel said it would add to earnings immediately.Henkel's shares were up 0.5 percent at 85.69 euros at 0937 GMT, valuing the company at about $47 billion.BC Partners was advised by JP Morgan and Rothschild on the transaction.

173,"   By Steve Holland | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON President Barack Obama has chosen former Procter & Gamble Chief Executive Bob McDonald, an Army veteran, as his nominee to be the next secretary of veterans affairs, a senior Obama administration official said on Sunday.Obama's announcement of McDonald, 61, will be made this week, possibly on Monday. If confirmed by the Senate, McDonald would be tasked with repairing the Veterans Administration after widespread evidence of delays in military veterans getting healthcare at VA facilities.The announcement is to come days after a White House review found significant and chronic failures across the board at the Veterans Administration and evidence that a ""corrosive culture"" prevails.A senior administration official said Obama was attracted to McDonald by his corporate background and military service. He would succeed Eric Shinseki, who resigned late in May after the depth of the VA's problems became clear.McDonald is the former chairman, president and CEO of Procter & Gamble, having retired a year ago after 33 years with the Fortune 500 company, where he started as a brand assistant in 1980 and rose through the ranks.He served on the McKinsey Advisory Council, the Singapore International Advisory Council of the Economic Development Board, and on the boards of U.S. Steel and Xerox Corp.Officials believe his lengthy tenure at P&G prepares him well for a huge agency with management challenges in providing services to more 8 million veterans a year. At P&G, he oversaw more than 120,000 employees, with operations around the world, selling products in more than 180 countries. MILITARY BACKGROUND U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner called McDonald ""a good man, a veteran, and a strong leader with decades of experience in the private sector. With those traits, he's the kind of person who is capable of implementing the kind of dramatic systemic change that is badly needed and long overdue at the VA.""But Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, added: ""The next VA secretary can only succeed in implementing that type of change if his boss, the president, first commits to doing whatever it takes to give our veterans the world class health care system they deserve by articulating a vision for sweeping reform. Our nation's veterans deserve nothing less.""After graduating in the top 2 percent of his class at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, McDonald served in the U.S. Army as a captain, primarily in the 82nd Airborne Division, and received the Meritorious Service Medal.    ""Bob is an immensely gifted and caring individual.  That was evident to me when we first met as cadets at West Point, over 40 years ago,"" retired Major General James ""Spider"" Marks said in a statement.

175,"  (Corrects fourth paragraph to read ""portfolio acquired from Merck"", not ""portfolio acquired by Merck"")* Coppertone, Dr. Scholl's draw interest after $14 bln deal* Bayer says to hold on to non-drug consumer brandsBy Ludwig Burger and Arno SchuetzeFRANKFURT, July 1 German drugmaker Bayer said it would keep the Dr. Scholl's and Coppertone brands it bagged as part of a $14 billion buy from U.S. Merck, despite overtures from companies keen to grab them, widening its healthcare line to include consumer goods.Just weeks after clinching the deal to buy Merck 's non-prescription drugs business, Bayer - best known as a life sciences company which makes cancer drugs - is being courted by rivals keen to acquire the foot care and sunscreen brands, several people with knowledge of the approaches told Reuters.But when asked about the expressions of interest for Dr. Scholl's and Coppertone - each worth more than $1 billion - Bayer said it was not planning to untie the Merck bundle it secured in May in a competitive bidding tussle with Reckitt Benckiser, Procter & Gamble Co and Novartis .""We intend to keep the portfolio acquired from Merck & Co. as a core business,"" Bayer said in a written statement.The German company, which makes contraceptives as well as prescription drugs against cancer, heart disease and multiple sclerosis, said when it bought the Merck business that its aim was to become global leader in over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. The deal was the largest in the German healthcare sector since Bayer bought rival Schering for 17 billion euros ($24 billion) in 2006.But with Bayer's existing OTC medicines business listing products like aspirin and Canesten antifungal creams, some are questioning the logic of it wanting to keep everyday products like sunscreen.""They aren't really part of the core business and don't have much to do with medicines in the strict sense,"" said Warburg Research analyst Ulrich Huwald.Offloading Dr. Scholl's foot care and Coppertone, which account for 27 percent of the Merck bundle's combined annual sales, would allow Bayer to focus on Merck's core healthcare products such as allergy remedy Claritin and MiraLAX laxative, analysts say, and give it the resources to make the most of those brands. Repeated comments by chief executive Marijn Dekkers in the past that Bayer - the inventor of aspirin - is mainly about life sciences and molecular research, seem to have given hope to consumer goods companies that he might yet have wanted to part with brands that have little to do with healthcare.Reckitt Benckiser, which owns the Scholl foot care brand outside the United States, as well as Beiersdorf and L'Oreal were seen as potential acquirers. Officials at the three companies declined to comment.GOING FOR SHELF SPACE?  There are however sound reasons for Bayer to retain Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's despite the products being so different to much of its other business: Big U.S. drug store chains such as Walgreen Co and CVS Caremark  prefer dealing with suppliers that can fill large amounts of shelf space and the two big consumer brands would add to Bayer's bargaining power.Bayer has also said that the Merck deal, which is expected to close in the second half of the year, should allow it to make better use of its distribution network and sales force and give it more clout when dealing with retailers.There may however be another reason Bayer is reluctant to sell. Having bought Merck's unit for more than twice the core earnings multiple at which Johnson & Johnson, the world's largest consumer care company, is trading, any spin-off sales might reveal it to have overpaid.One source said Coppertone and Dr. Scholl's, with $275 million and $309 million in 2013 sales, respectively, could be worth as much as $4 billion between them, reflecting the sales multiple of about 6.5 that Bayer paid for the entire Merck consumer bundle.But another person said that Dr. Scholl's was more likely to fetch $1 billion to $1.5 billion, and Coppertone about $1 billion, because personal care products change hands for lower multiples than the medicines included in last month's deal.Selling on some consumer brands for a lower earnings multiple than what was agreed for the entire Merck portfolio would exposed the high price paid for the remaining OTC drugs - and might not go down well with Bayer investors.""Shareholders would start to do the maths,"" the source said.

176,"  WASHINGTON Bob McDonald, President Barack Obama's choice to run the Veterans Affairs Department, looked set for an easy Senate confirmation after the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee unanimously approved his nomination on Wednesday.McDonald, the former chief executive of consumer products giant Procter & Gamble Co, pledged to senators on Tuesday to bring corporate-style discipline, accountability and efficiency to the troubled agency, which has been rocked by healthcare waiting time scandals and accusations of mismanagement and fraud.Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who is chairman of the veterans committee, said after the 14-0 vote that he expects   the full Senate to confirm McDonald as secretary of the department within days. McDonald, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, served as an Army captain in the late 1970s before working his way through the Procter & Gamble ranks.

""Number one, he is familiar with the military because he served for many years and he brings a passion to take care of our veterans.""

177,"  (Adds comment from veterans committee chairman, details on reform bill)WASHINGTON, July 29 The U.S. Senate on Tuesday unanimously confirmed Bob McDonald as the next Veterans Affairs secretary, pinning Washington's hopes on the former Procter & Gamble Co chief executive to launch a massive turnaround effort at the troubled agency.McDonald, 61, replaces retired Army general Eric Shinseki, who resigned in late May amid a scandal over cover-ups of long waiting times for health-care appointments at VA hospitals and clinics across the country.The 97-0 vote to confirm McDonald comes a week after he pledged to bring corporate-style discipline and accountability to the agency, refocusing its 341,000 employees on serving veterans. ""In the wake of the biggest scandal in the history of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Bob McDonald certainly has his work cut out for him,"" House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller said after the Senate vote.""In order to be successful, McDonald will need to take swift and decisive action to discipline employees responsible for mismanagement, negligence and corruption that harms veterans while taking bold steps to replace the department's culture of complacency with a climate of accountability,"" Miller added. McDonald, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point who served as P&G CEO from 2009 to 2013, is widely expected to start his new job with an extra $17 billion at his disposal to reduce months-long health care wait times in new legislation slated for passage by Congress this week. The compromise measure reached by the leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives Veterans Affairs committees on Monday would allow veterans forced to wait more than 30 days for an appointment to seek care from private doctors at VA expense. It would provide $5 billion for the VA to hire more doctors and nurses and open 27 new clinics across the country.The measure also would give McDonald sweeping new authorities to fire or demote VA employees for poor performance, subject to a 21-day appeal process. To date, no one has been dismissed at VA over the misrepresentation of wait-time data.McDonald retired last year at P&G, best known as the maker of Tide detergent, Gillette razors and Crest toothpaste, amid a major corporate restructuring as some institutional investors had pushed for faster improvements in profits and better stock performance.

The compromise measure reached by the leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives Veterans Affairs committees on Monday would allow veterans forced to wait more than 30 days for an appointment to seek care from private doctors at VA expense. It also will provide $5 billion for the VA to pay for doctors and nurses. McDonald retired at P&G, best known as the maker of Tide  detergent, Gillette razors and Crest toothpaste, amid a major corporate restructuring as some institutional investors had pushed for faster improvements in profits and better stock performance. The company brought back McDonald's predecessor,  Alan Lafley, to serve as its chairman and chief executive.

The jobs growth, which came in below economists' forecasts, relieved some investors worried about how soon the Fed could bump up interest rates after data on Thursday showed U.S. labor costs recorded their biggest gain in more than 5-1/2 years in the second quarter.But concern remained over Argentina's debt problems after the country's default earlier this week. A U.S. judge on Friday criticized Argentina's decision to default and ordered negotiations between the country and holdout investors to continue.""Anytime a country defaults on its debt, it's usually an unnerving event in the market.

Data showed 209,000 jobs were created in July, below the 233,000 that was expected. Analysts had speculated that a stronger-than-expected report would give the Fed flexibility to hike rates.

Twenty-three of the brands have sales of between $1 billion and $10 billion. ""Less will be much more,"" Chief Executive A.G. Lafley said.P&G did not name the brands it planned to sell, keep or discontinue, but Lafley told Reuters the company's family, feminine and baby care business would lose fewer brands than its other four businesses.The business, which houses brands such as Pampers diapers and Always sanitary napkins, is P&G's fastest-growing and was the company's second-biggest revenue contributor in the year ended June 30.P&G's top 80 brands had sales of about $84.1 billion in 2013 while the other roughly 100 brands had sales of just $2.4 billion, according to Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj.The company might be more likely to sell laundry brands Fab and Trojan, Perma Sharp shaving blades and Fekkai hair products among others, Dibadj wrote in a note. P&G could potentially keep its Gillette, Tide, Pantene, Oral B, Olay and Old Spice brands, he wrote. P&G said it would have fewer but larger distribution centers in North America and would focus on strengthening its presence in emerging markets, or what Lafley called the company's ""engines of growth"".Lafley told Reuters he expects the moves to result in fewer job cuts than the near 10,000 the company cut in 2002.SLUGGISH SALES  P&G's revenue growth has been sluggish, with sales missing Wall Street's estimates in nine of the last 13 quarters.The company says it has been hurt by ""choppy"" growth in developed markets, tough competition and a strengthening U.S. dollar.P&G has sought to cut expenses by streamlining management, reducing costs and cutting jobs under a five-year, $10 billion restructuring plan announced in 2012.P&G's organic sales, which excludes divestitures and acquisitions, rose 2 percent in the fourth quarter, but currency losses wiped out the gains.

192,"   By Eric Kelsey and Jennifer Saba | LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK  LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK When NFL players strap on their pink shoes and gloves in October for the league's annual Breast Cancer Awareness Month campaign, it will be doing so with one less sponsor, a notable retreat blamed on the league's handling of domestic violence.Crest, Procter & Gamble Co's dental brand, will no longer be offering pink mouth guards to NFL players, the company said on Friday, the first sponsor to publicly withdraw from the NFL's signature overture to women.""The brand has decided to cancel on-field activation with NFL teams,"" Procter & Gamble said in a statement.The company added it will honor its planned $100,000 donation to the American Cancer Society, the NFL's long-time partner in the October campaign.Procter & Gamble's retreat from the NFL's game plan to woo women illustrates the risk America's most popular sports league faces with its female fans while it seeks to correct its acknowledged poor handling of domestic violence cases.""From a family perspective it makes it really hard to support it (the NFL) even though lots of people love it,"" said Kelley Skoloda, a women's marketing expert at Ketchum Inc. The NFL draws 6 million women to games every week and women account for about 45 percent of the league's audience. Women represent a key growth area for the league which has nearly maxed out its audience among U.S. men.On Friday, a chastened NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell sought to take control of the public outcry, vowing that the league would change its personal conduct policy and he would cede some power in the process. Domestic violence mushroomed into an issue for the league when Goodell suspended former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice two games for knocking out his then-fiancee Janay Palmer, a punishment considered by many as too lenient. Goodell later bowed to public pressure and reversed course, suspending Rice indefinitely when website TMZ published a video of the punch on Sept. 8.Sponsors sought to distance themselves from the NFL this week with consumer brands McDonald's Corp, Campbell's Soup Co and Anheuser-Busch InBev saying they had expressed their concerns to the league. ""I believe that women became open to becoming serious NFL fans because they were not aware to Roger Goodell's and owners' response to domestic violence,"" said Terry O'Neill, the president of the National Organization for Women, which has called for Goodell to resign.     For its part, the NFL has donated some $6 million to the American Cancer Society for education and screening grants.Skoloda, a marketing expert, says for the NFL's female fans and the sponsors who want to court them, it is a defining moment for the league.Women, who tend to judge their personal success on the well-being of their children according to Skoloda, are also grappling with the long-term health effects of football, including brain trauma.""They're playing with things that are at the very top of the list of how moms and women define their personal success,"" said Skoloda.

198,"   By Alexandra Alper | MEXICO CITY  MEXICO CITY The world's largest household product maker Procter & Gamble and No. 2 toymaker Hasbro are at the heart of a Mexican probe into tax avoidance that could cost the firms hundreds of millions of dollars in back-taxes between them, sources told Reuters. In January, Mexico said it had launched a probe of 270 companies for allegedly exploiting tax loopholes that have leaked income out of Mexico for years. At first, seven multinationals were the focus of the government's ""informal audit,"" led by Oscar Molina, who audits big companies at Mexico's tax collection agency SAT.But Molina says he is in advanced discussions with two companies to pay more income tax for prior years. He didn't name them but said one of the two has been involved in litigation since 2005 over the extent of its taxable presence in Mexico. The other, he said, has been less aggressive and had made gradual changes to its tax scheme. Five sources have told Reuters the firms are Hasbro and P&G.In its 2014 second quarter report released in July, Hasbro said it is defending itself against outstanding tax assessments by Mexican authorities totaling about $250 million for the 2000 to 2007 period related to how it accounts for cross-border transactions, known as transfer pricing issues.""The company is party to discussions with the Mexican tax authorities to determine if the two parties can reach an agreed settlement of these issues,"" Hasbro said in the filing. It said it has made a settlement offer to authorities without specifying the amount.SAT says the probe, which still includes a handful of firms, involves examining corporate structures that ensure profits based on Mexican manufacturing activities or sales to Mexican customers are reported in offshore units, beyond the reach of the Mexican tax authority. Molina is arguing that these offshore units which derive profits from economic activity in Mexico, had a de facto taxable residence or permanent establishment in Mexico and so, he can tax their Mexico-related profit. Tax authorities in Spain, France and Norway have previously gone to court to argue a multinational using such profit shifting structures, had a deemed permanent establishment in their countries. However, those efforts largely failed, which is partly why countries are now pressing for changes in international tax rules which would bring profits shifted offshore by convoluted arrangements back within reach of tax authorities.Mexico levies 30 percent income tax on firms, above OECD countries' average of 25 percent. ""We are working under the understanding that there is permanent establishment,"" Molina said in a June interview about the probe. ""They send away part of the income. And we say: No, no, no. Your income is bigger than that. And it is because of your permanent establishment.""P&G and Hasbro declined to comment on whether they are being probed. Neither company revealed their tax obligations in Mexico.Hasbro spokeswoman Julie Duffy said that the global toymaker is often involved in tax audits around the world. P&G spokeswoman Jennifer Corso said in an email that the company pays all taxes owed in more than 150 tax jurisdictions and does not pursue aggressive tax planning.     Ohio-based P&G, the maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent, employs about 7,000 people at eight plants, two distribution centers and an office in Mexico, the company said.RULES REVIEW An undated confidential document that a source said P&G submitted to the Mexican government last year described the company's operations in Mexico. It was reviewed by Reuters and shows about $1 billion in revenue and some $3 billion in exports from P&G Mexico in 2012. Neither Hasbro nor P&G have said how much income tax they pay annually in Mexico. SAT would not say how much it believed the two companies it is in advanced talks with should pay.  Hasbro, known for its My Little Pony toys and Transformers action figures, generates nearly $200 million in Mexican sales annually, according to a confidential document, also undated and about its operations in Mexico, that the source said the firm presented to the government in 2013.The toymaker has offices in Mexico City, a distribution center and sales personnel in five cities, the document said. The Rhode Island based-firm, which trails only Mattel in the world toy market according to Euromonitor, says it has 245 employees in Mexico. Mexico's actions reflect growing frustration among some large developing countries, including China and India, with legal loopholes in international tax rules that companies can exploit to shift profits to tax havens. Mexico's SAT argues that by doing so, some companies are avoiding their tax dues. In 2012, the group of 20 leading economies stepped up efforts to crack down on corporate tax dodging, after reports of firms like Apple and Google using complex structures to slash their tax bills sparked outrage. The G20 asked the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) to review the rules on how multinationals are taxed, emboldening Mexico to pursue its own tax avoidance probe. Mexico, a haven for auto manufacturers and light assembly plants, has the lowest tax take in the OECD, crimping its ability to spend on programs vital to boosting economic growth and living standards. The main factor in determining whether a company has a taxable presence or a ""permanent establishment"" in a country is the extent of its sales operations there.    But loopholes allow companies to avoid hefty levies in high-tax countries where they generate big sales revenue, for example, by signing sales contracts abroad.Molina said he could complete formal audits of the firms he is in advanced talks with quickly and go to court if they don't reach a deal.

200,"   By Anna Ringstrom | STOCKHOLM  STOCKHOLM Sweden's SCA, the world's biggest maker of incontinence pads, is accelerating product upgrades and boosting promotions to counter the re-entry of U.S. personal care giant Procter & Gambler into the market, its CEO told Reuters.However, Jan Johansson brushed off some analysts' advice that he should respond with a change in strategy, such as extending one of SCA's feminine care brands into incontinence. ""We’ve known about this for quite some time, longer than the market. Our concern was that they’d come out with an entirely new product range that we don’t have,"" he said in an interview.  ""But there was no innovation that we didn't know about.""SCA accounts for about a quarter of the global market for adult diapers, with its top-selling Tena brand making more than 10 billion crowns ($1.4 billion) of sales a year, out of a group total of 89 billion crowns last year.  The firm's shares have fallen around 16 percent since P&G hinted in June -- and then confirmed in August -- that it would return to the incontinence care market after a 15 year absence. P&G has begun rolling out in Europe, where SCA has the bulk of business, and the United States.            Handelsbanken analyst Karri Rinta, who has an accumulate rating on SCA's shares, has warned SCA could lose 30 percent of its operating profit from incontinence products in 2016 due to P&G's extension of its well-established feminine care brand Always into the market.  However, Johansson said analysts were underestimating the strength of the Tena brand and that SCA would be able to defend its position with product upgrades and innovations. He said it had brought forward upgrades, such as a higher-and-faster absorption pad for people who suffer incontinence during a sudden sneeze. It has also reallocated resources from advertising toward promotions in order to match P&G's offers. Aging populations and the fact incontinence is also widespread among younger adults, most of which don't use incontinence pads, means it is a market with huge potential, Johansson added. SCA estimates that less than 40 percent of sufferers in Europe use incontinence pads or pants, with fewer than 5 percent of incontinent men using the products.  SCA, which started out as a forestry company in 1929 and makes the largest share of its revenues from tissues, sells most of its incontinence products directly to the healthcare industry, with less than 30 percent of revenues from retailers. P&G, which made net sales of $83 billion in its latest financial year, is focusing on the retail market for now. Johansson dismissed the idea of investing heavily in one of SCA's feminine care brands and, once it was bigger, extending it into incontinence products for the retail market.   ""Tena is much stronger (than SCA's feminine care brands) so it would be daft to change brand,"" he said.    Johansson also said he had no plans to shift focus more to emerging markets at the expense of Europe.""Europe, too, is a fantastic growth market as long as we find a good way to increase penetration. (P&G's entry) means more competition, but also helps drive penetration,"" he said.Independently of P&G's return, SCA is investing online, where it sees a big potential market due to the embarrassment felt by some incontinence sufferers when buying products in store. The firm has its own online stores in several markets.

208,"  * Microsoft, Procter & Gamble results lift U.S. shares     * Ebola scare diminishes, boosting U.S. shares     * U.S. Treasuries prices stable on reduced Ebola concerns     * Euro rises ahead of European bank stress test results   (Adds close of U.S. markets)     By Sam Forgione     NEW YORK, Oct 24 Global equity markets rose on Friday after strong corporate results from Microsoft and Procter & Gamble and reduced concerns over the possible spread of Ebola boosted U.S. shares and kept safe-haven U.S. Treasuries prices stable.      MSCI's all-country world equity index rose 3.1 percent for the week, marking its biggest weekly percentage gain since July 2013, while the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 was up 5.5 percent from its low on Oct. 15 and notched its best weekly gain in almost two years. Solid U.S. corporate results bolstered shares over the week.      News late on Thursday of the first person to test positive for Ebola in New York City weighed on European shares, and while the scare initially held back buying in the United States, U.S. investors later shook off those concerns.      ""Ebola is something you want to keep an eye on, but the probability of widespread infection is pretty small, and I think that's what the market believes,"" said Scott Wren, senior equity strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis.     ""Stocks were oversold. Investors were over-worried about global growth, they were over-worried about Ebola,"" he added on reasons for the stock market rally over the week.      Corporate earnings were mixed. Microsoft and Procter & Gamble rose following their quarterly results, offsetting a plunge in Amazon after the online retailer reported an earnings miss. Microsoft shares closed up 2.5 percent at $46.13, while Amazon shares closed down 8.3 percent at $287.06.     The euro rose against the dollar on the view that a weekend update on the euro zone banking sector's financial health would not reveal too many problems at the region's top banks. As of the end of 2013, 25 banks failed the European stress tests, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.        MSCI's all-country world equity index was last up 0.45 percent, to 409.23. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  of top European shares closed down 0.34 percent at 1,312.74.     The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 0.76 percent at 16,805.41, while the S&P 500 closed up 0.71 percent at 1,964.58. The Nasdaq Composite closed up 0.69 percent at 4,483.72.     The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, fell 0.14 percent to 85.721. U.S. 10-year Treasury notes were last up 3/32 in price to yield 2.2658 percent.      Brent oil prices fell but were little changed on the week, while U.S. crude oil futures continued to slide. Brent crude  settled at $86.13 per barrel, down 70 cents for the day, while U.S. crude settled down $1.08 at $81.01 per barrel.

211,"   By Sruthi Ramakrishnan and Nandita Bose  Procter & Gamble Co on Friday said it would sell its Duracell battery business, probably through a split-off into a separate company, as it looks to focus on faster-growing brands.P&G shares rose about 3 percent as investors shrugged off a marginal fall in quarterly sales and warning that a stronger dollar would significantly hurt revenue and earnings this quarter. A surging U.S. currency, reduces the value of overseas sales when they are translated back into U.S. dollars. P&G and Colgate-Palmolive Co, which on Friday reported a 17 percent drop in third-quarter profit and lowered its full-year earnings forecast, are the latest companies to be hurt by a stronger dollar. Emerging markets generate about 50 percent of Colgate's sales and about 39 percent of P&G's revenue comes from developing markets.    The world's No. 1 household products maker said in August it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands in the next two years. Duracell, the world's No. 1 battery business, was widely considered to be one of the largest assets that P&G was likely to divest. On a conference call, Chief Financial Officer John Moeller said the company had sold or discontinued 11 brands in the latest quarter and 25 in the last five quarters. Analysts expect it to sell laundry brands Fab and Trojan, Perma Sharp shaving blades and Fekkai hair products, among others.  Demand for Duracell's mainstay non-rechargeable, disposable alkaline batteries has waned while a worldwide explosion in electronic devices has increased demand for re-chargeable batteries.P&G, whose brands include Pampers diapers and Tide detergent, said it would first sell its interest in a China-based battery joint venture for an undisclosed amount and then exit Duracell completely.The company said it was looking to split Duracell off into a stand-alone company but would consider alternatives that offer better value to shareholders.Under the split-off, expected in the second half of 2015, P&G shareholders would be able to exchange some, none or all of their stock for shares of Duracell. SALES STRUGGLE P&G said it expected the percentage growth in its net sales in fiscal 2015 to be little changed or rise in the low single digits, including a 2 percentage point negative impact from a strong dollar.  Net income attributable to P&G fell to $1.99 billion, or 69 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Sept. 30 from $3.03 billion, or $1.04 per share, a year earlier. Core earnings, excluding the currency impact, were $1.07 per share, in line with the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Net sales dipped to $20.79 billion from $20.83 billion due to currency fluctuations and divestitures. Organic sales, excluding those effects, increased 2 percent.Shares of P&G were up 2.6 percent at $85.41 at midday.

MSCI's all-country world equity index was set for its biggest weekly gain since July 2013, while the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 was on pace for its first weekly gain in five and best week since the start of 2013, bolstered by solid U.S. corporate results.      News of the first person to test positive for Ebola in America's largest city weighed on European shares and held back buying in the United States, but overall the market's reaction to new Ebola cases was nowhere near as dramatic as the volatility witnessed earlier in October when fears of a rapid spread of the disease frightened investors.      ""I think the fears are a bit overdone. In previous cases, such as avian flu, the virus ended up being contained quite quickly,"" said Caroline Vincent, European equities fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management.     Corporate earnings were mixed. Microsoft and Procter & Gamble rose following their quarterly results, offsetting a plunge in Amazon after the online retailer reported an earnings miss. Microsoft shares were last up 1.6 percent at $45.76, while Amazon shares were last down 8.2 percent at $287.44.     U.S. Treasuries prices were up slightly as worries about Ebola stoked safe-haven demand for low-risk U.S. government debt, even as prices pared some gains on news that a nurse in Dallas who contracted Ebola is now free of the virus.       The euro rose against the dollar on the view that a weekend update on the euro zone banking sector's financial health would not reveal too many problems at the region's top banks. As of the end of 2013, 25 banks failed the European stress tests, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.        MSCI's all-country world equity index was last up 0.35 percent at 408.8. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  of top European shares closed down 0.34 percent at 1,312.74.     The Dow Jones industrial average was last up 0.4 percent at 16,743.97, while the S&P 500 was up 0.31 percent at 1,956.96. The Nasdaq Composite was up 0.25 percent at 4,463.72.     The dollar index, which tracks the greenback versus a basket of six currencies, was down 0.15 percent at 85.714. U.S. 10-year Treasury notes were last up 4/32 in price to yield 2.2623 percent.     Oil prices fell, with Brent crude last down 0.45 percent at $86.44 a barrel, while U.S. crude lost 1.1 percent, at $81.19 per barrel.

Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, reported a slight fall in quarterly sales on Friday and said a stronger dollar would significantly hurt revenue and earnings in the current quarter.Colgate's net income fell to $542 million, or 59 cents per share, in the quarter, from $656 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier. Worldwide net sales fell marginally to $4.38 billion.Organic sales, which strip out the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, rose 3.5 percent.Excluding items, the company earned 76 cents per share, in line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of the company, which have lost about 4.5 percent in the past three months, closed at $65.05 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday.

Such investigations are usually resolved with a hefty fine, with the companies resuming business as usual before any real toll is taken on operations or profits.""It is commercial operations that have been stopped.

226,"   By Jonathan Stempel and Devika  Krishna Kumar  Berkshire Hathaway Inc has agreed to acquire Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery unit in a complex transaction that lets Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett buy a business he has supported for two decades and shave his company's tax bill.Rather than pay cash, Berkshire (BRKa.N) will give P&G $4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world's largest consumer products company. P&G (PG.N) will infuse $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015.The transaction announced on Thursday helps P&G Chief Executive A.G. Lafley streamline his Cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue. P&G's better-known products include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers.Buffett, meanwhile, avoids a big tax bill that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire might have incurred if it sold its P&G shares. Both P&G and Berkshire shares hit a record high this week.Buying Duracell is a ""brilliant move,"" said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, and is a longtime Berkshire critic who is selling its shares short.""Warren loves mature and durable consumer brands that produce predictable cash flow. Duracell fits the bill,"" Kass added. ""And accomplishing this in a tax-efficient transaction.""Berkshire has said it paid just $336 million for its 1.9 percent stake in P&G, equal to 52.8 million shares on June 30.Assuming a 35 percent tax rate on corporate capital gains, the swap could save Berkshire more than $1 billion, on top of tax savings from two similar transactions earlier this year.Berkshire's income tax bill was $8.95 billion in 2013, or 31 percent of pretax earnings. NOT A GOOD SIGN Duracell, whose batteries are known for their copper-colored tops, gives Buffett a familiar name to add to Berkshire's stable of more than 80 businesses, including Benjamin Moore paint, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain and Heinz ketchup.""I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,"" Buffett said in a statement. [ID:nBw5J6R8za]Some analysts questioned why Berkshire views Duracell as a good fit, while P&G does not.While Duracell has more than one-fourth of the global market for batteries, demand has slackened amid the growth in smartphones and other devices that rely on rechargeable power sources.""It is a good thing that P&G is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. ""I don't take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G."" Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.In afternoon trading, Berkshire's Class A shares were up 0.4 percent at $218,912, while P&G fell 0.7 percent to $88.87.""WILLING AND EAGER""  Berkshire has owned P&G stock since P&G bought Gillette Co in 2005. Buffett had invested in Gillette since 1989. Buffett was about halfway through a 14-year stint on Gillette's board when that company agreed to buy Duracell for $7 billion in stock in 1996. That's more than twice what Berkshire is paying, after accounting for the cash infusion.Buffett prefers owning businesses, especially if they are easy to understand and have strong competitive advantages, to the underlying stock.Earlier this year, Buffett swapped stock of Phillips 66 (PSX.N) for a unit that makes chemicals for pipelines, and stock of Graham Holdings Co (GHC.N), which once published the Washington Post, for a Miami TV station and other assets.Buffett has plenty of ammunition to buy more businesses:  Berkshire had $62.38 billion in cash as of Sept. 30.P&G will take a noncash charge of 28 cents per share to write down goodwill and intangible assets, and adjust fiscal 2014 results to reflect Duracell as a discontinued operation.Shares of Energizer Holdings Inc (ENR.N), Duracell's main rival, rose as much as 4.7 percent to a record high before easing to $128.43, up 2.6 percent.UBS household products analyst Stephen Powers said private equity investors might look for value in Energizer, given how Buffett proved ""willing and eager"" to buy Duracell.Goldman Sachs, Jones Day, and Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft advised P&G.

""He is stating in transaction that Duracell is inexpensive and P&G stock is expensive. And accomplishing this all in tax-efficient transaction.""

P&G bought Gillette in 2005 in a $57 billion deal that Buffett supported. Berkshire held more than 101 million P&G shares in 2007 and cut the stake several times since then as the consumer-goods company faltered under previous Chief Executive Officer Bob McDonald. Berkshire had fewer than 53 million shares as of June 30.Although P&G shares hit a life-time high of $89.88 on Wednesday, they have underperformed the market. Since its market bottom in March 2009, P&G has doubled in price. That pales next to the 147 percent gain in P&G's peer sector, the S&P consumer staples index, and the tripling in value of the wider S&P 500.  And P&G shares are expensive. They are trading at roughly 20 times forward earnings compared with a peer median of 18.7 times, and 16.5 times cash flow versus a peer median of 14.2. That means P&G is more expensive than half its peers in arguably one of the market's priciest sectors.

230,"  * Buffett to return $4.7 billion worth of shares to P&G* Purchase is ""brilliant move"" for Buffett - money manager   (Adds link to Breakingviews column)By Jonathan Stempel and Devika  Krishna KumarNov 13 Berkshire Hathaway Inc has agreed to acquire Procter & Gamble Co's Duracell battery unit in a complex transaction that lets Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett buy a business he has supported for two decades and shave his company's tax bill.Rather than pay cash, Berkshire will give P&G $4.7 billion of the shares it now owns in the world's largest consumer products company. P&G will infuse $1.8 billion in cash into Duracell before the expected closing in the second half of 2015.The transaction announced on Thursday helps P&G Chief Executive A.G. Lafley streamline his Cincinnati-based company by shedding slow-growing brands and focus on about 80 brands that generate most of its profit and revenue. P&G's better-known products include Tide laundry detergent and Pampers diapers.Buffett, meanwhile, avoids a big tax bill that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire might have incurred if it sold its P&G shares. Both P&G and Berkshire shares hit a record high this week.Buying Duracell is a ""brilliant move,"" said Doug Kass, who runs Seabreeze Partners Management in Palm Beach, Florida, and is a longtime Berkshire critic who is selling its shares short.""Warren loves mature and durable consumer brands that produce predictable cash flow. Duracell fits the bill,"" Kass added. ""And accomplishing this in a tax-efficient transaction.""Berkshire has said it paid just $336 million for its 1.9 percent stake in P&G, equal to 52.8 million shares on June 30.Assuming a 35 percent tax rate on corporate capital gains, the swap could save Berkshire more than $1 billion, on top of tax savings from two similar transactions earlier this year. Berkshire's income tax bill was $8.95 billion in 2013, or 31 percent of pretax earnings.NOT A GOOD SIGN Duracell, whose batteries are known for their copper-colored tops, gives Buffett a familiar name to add to Berkshire's stable of more than 80 businesses, including Benjamin Moore paint, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain and Heinz ketchup.""I have always been impressed by Duracell, as a consumer and as a long-term investor in P&G and Gillette,"" Buffett said in a statement.Some analysts questioned why Berkshire views Duracell as a good fit, while P&G does not. While Duracell has more than one-fourth of the global market for batteries, demand has slackened amid the growth in smartphones and other devices that rely on rechargeable power sources.""It is a good thing that P&G is moving swiftly to divest its non-core brands,"" Sanford Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. ""I don't take it as a good sign that Buffett would rather own Duracell than P&G.""Buffett's assistant did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.In afternoon trading, Berkshire's Class A shares were up 0.4 percent at $218,912, while P&G fell 0.7 percent to $88.87. ""WILLING AND EAGER"" Berkshire has owned P&G stock since P&G bought Gillette Co in 2005. Buffett had invested in Gillette since 1989.Buffett was about halfway through a 14-year stint on Gillette's board when that company agreed to buy Duracell for $7 billion in stock in 1996. That's more than twice what Berkshire is paying, after accounting for the cash infusion.Buffett prefers owning businesses, especially if they are easy to understand and have strong competitive advantages, to the underlying stock.Earlier this year, Buffett swapped stock of Phillips 66  for a unit that makes chemicals for pipelines, and stock of Graham Holdings Co, which once published the Washington Post, for a Miami TV station and other assets.Buffett has plenty of ammunition to buy more businesses:  Berkshire had $62.38 billion in cash as of Sept. 30.P&G will take a noncash charge of 28 cents per share to write down goodwill and intangible assets, and adjust fiscal 2014 results to reflect Duracell as a discontinued operation.Shares of Energizer Holdings Inc, Duracell's main rival, rose as much as 4.7 percent to a record high before easing to $128.43, up 2.6 percent.UBS household products analyst Stephen Powers said private equity investors might look for value in Energizer, given how Buffett proved ""willing and eager"" to buy Duracell.Goldman Sachs, Jones Day, and Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft advised P&G.

236,"  BUENOS AIRES Nov 17 Argentina tightened its international trade controls on Monday by creating a new government agency to keep track of imports and exports two weeks after accusing U.S. household products giant Procter & Gamble Co  of tax fraud.Early this month Argentina said the company hid income and over-billed $138 million in imports to get money out of the country, which three years ago introduced stringent capital controls to protect its dwindling foreign reserves.The government published a decree on Monday creating the Trade Operations Tracking Unit. The new agency will ""verify the price and quantity of goods and services exported and imported, along with the inflow and outflow of foreign exchange,"" the decree said. International reserves held by Argentina's central bank have fallen 7.6 percent so far this year to $28.3 billion.Cut off from the global bond market due to repeated debt defaults and interventionist policies that have slowed the economy to a standstill while inflation rages at an estimated 40 percent, Argentina relies on its reserves for financing. Cincinnati-based P&G, the maker of Gillette razors and Tide detergent, denied wrongdoing and has entered talks with the Argentine government over the allegations of tax evasion. The company, which runs three manufacturing plants and two distribution centers in Argentina, says its Argentine operations contribute about 1 percent to its overall sales.Argentina has also accused a handful of local banks and international grains exporting companies of tax evasion charges similar to those lodged against P&G.

238,"   By Anjuli Davies and Freya Berry | LONDON  LONDON Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) is working with Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to explore the sale of its Wella hair care business that could be worth around $7 billion, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, as the world's largest consumer products company streamlines its business. P&G is exploring all options for the unit, which includes a professional and a trade business. That may result in selling the whole or parts, the sources said on Friday, cautioning that no final decision had been taken. A P&G spokesman said the company did not comment on rumor or speculation. Goldman Sachs was not immediately available to comment. Cincinnati-based P&G said in August it would shed 80 to 100 slow-growing product lines in order to focus on about 80 brands such as Tide laundry detergents and Pampers diapers which generate most of its profit and revenue.     In November, it announced the sale of its Duracell battery unit to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and it has already sold the bulk of its pet food business to Mars Inc and Spectrum Brand Holdings Inc.  In the hair care segment, P&G also owns Clairol, which it bought from Bristol-Myers Squibb for $4.95 billion in 2001, and Vidal Sassoon.     Prospective buyers could include Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group Unilever (ULVR.L) and Germany's Henkel, which made an informal approach for Wella in 2002 before it was subsequently sold to P&G in 2003 for 6.5 billion euros ($8.1 billion).     P&G has undertaken a multi-year restructuring program, cutting thousands of jobs and taking steps to streamline operations, launch new products and expand into fast-growing emerging markets, under pressure from shareholders including activist investor William A. Ackman, who took a stake in P&G in 2012.      It is also thought to be exploring options for Braun, which makes electric razors and toothbrushes and which it acquired as part of its $57 billion purchase of Gillette in 2005, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. It could also look to sell some of its fragrance business.

248,"   By Michael Georgy | CAIRO  CAIRO Procter & Gamble (PG.N) expects Egypt's economic growth could return to levels seen before the country's 2011 popular uprising within three years, but the government needs to make life easier for investors, the company's general manager for the region said.Mohamed Sultan, general manager and vice president, Near East, expressed confidence that stability had returned to the Arab country with its huge market of about 90 million people.""Within three years Egypt can be posting these numbers,"" he said, referring to economic growth of 5-7 percent Egypt achieved before the ouster of president Hosni Mubarak, compared to 2-3 percent now.Egypt is trying to secure its fragile recovery by conveying an investor-friendly image in the run-up to an investment conference in March.Sultan declined to give any profit forecasts or details on Procter & Gamble's investment plans in the country but he was cautiously optimistic. ""I think we have been through the worst. We are able to do business. That gives you confidence. I think we are heading in the right direction,"" he told Reuters in an interview.Egypt’s currency is a critical factor for foreign investors, particularly the persistence of a black market and constraints on dollar outflows.Sultan said exports allowed his company to secure funds but stressed that dealing with the foreign exchange issue would make Egypt more attractive to foreign investors. ""The biggest challenges for big companies is the dollar,"" said Sultan. ""A number of ideas are being studied with the banks that will make access to forex easier."" Procter & Gamble, one of the biggest non-oil sector investors in Egypt, sees growth potential in household  detergents and cleaning products as well as the diaper market.""Consumption per capita is still quite low compared to neighboring markets,"" Sultan said. Procter & Gamble exports 35 percent of its products to 37 countries, he said. It believes Africa offers the most growth potential, especially Kenya.Cheaper imports from Turkey, Malaysia and China, meanwhile, are posing a challenge in Egypt, Sultan said.(This story has been refiled to correct spelling of Procter in headline) (Editing by Jane Merriman)",2015-01-20,PG,"Tue Jan 20, 2015 | 2:10pm EST",Procter & Gamble optimistic over Egypt's economic recovery,http://www.reuters.com//article/us-egypt-procter-gamble-idUSKBN0KT27X20150120?type=companyNews,0.9882,0.039,0.821,0.14

It could take a couple of quarters for currency conversion losses to show up, she said.After hitting a 6-1/2 month low in May, the dollar  has surged nearly 20 percent against a basket of major currencies, making overseas sales denominated in other currencies less valuable in dollar terms. The stronger dollar can also make U.S.-made products more expensive for consumers in other currencies and thus cut demand.The Dow Jones industrial average, composed of large and well-known companies, was hit especially hard on Tuesday as six of seven companies in the index that reported results since Monday evening declined, with only United Technologies gaining.""You have companies who don't normally complain about (the dollar) who are starting to harp on it and it does make sense from an economic perspective that this would be a drag,"" said James Liu, global market strategist at JPMorgan Funds in Chicago. ""It's really the pace that matters - not just whether it is strengthening or weakening."" HEDGING HELP LIMITED WITH SHARP MOVES The choice for multinationals is stark. They can keep customers loyal by maintaining overseas prices and take a revenue hit from a tough conversion to dollars, or raise prices and risk the loss of customers to cheaper local competitors.While many companies successfully use currency hedging to at least partly protect against foreign exchange-related losses, the speed and extent of recent fluctuations have made it more difficult to hedge. This has also hurt Wall Street analysts' ability to estimate losses.One of the worst-hit companies appears to be chemicals giant DuPont, which derives roughly 60 percent of its revenue from overseas. DuPont said the strong dollar cut 7 cents per share off fourth-quarter earnings and will shave 60 cents off 2015 earnings per share based on recent currency rates. Procter & Gamble said foreign exchange will reduce its fiscal 2015 sales by 5 percent and its net earnings by 12 percent in what it described as its most significant currency impact ever. Bristol-Myers said it expects foreign exchange rates to cut its 2015 revenue by $800 million and 12 to 14 cents in terms of earnings per share.The impact looks even more abysmal when compared with the 1 cent per share currency impact target that multinationals set for their foreign exchange managers, according to FireApps.American icon Apple Inc is also at risk as it brings in roughly 62 percent of its revenue from overseas. It had to close its online store in Russia temporarily in December due to dramatic currency fluctuations.Currency could shave as much as $3 billion off Apple's 2015 revenue even if its hedging strategy succeeds in halving the impact, technology analyst Shannon Cross at Cross Research in Millburn, New Jersey, said ahead of its report.Apple's Chief Financial Officer said on Tuesday that foreign exchange is a ""clear headwind"" included in the company's guidance for the year ahead.Shares in Microsoft, which gets nearly three-quarters of its revenue from overseas, finished off 9.2 percent on Tuesday after it said it was hurt by the strong dollar but gave no specifics.Medical device maker Stryker Corp said that if exchange rates stay around current levels, it expects first- quarter and 2015 sales to be hurt by 3 percent to 4 percent.Other notables names citing currency headwinds so far in the earnings season include Johnson & Johnson and IBM .Dollar strength already shaved at least $4 billion off U.S. corporate revenue in the third quarter, according to FireApps. But actual losses may be much higher as many firms citing currency impacts did not disclose the amount, it noted.

It was the biggest percentage increase since July 2009 and also reflected a sputtering global economy.""It is not hard to come up with reasons for the weakness in today's report - sluggish foreign growth and a strong dollar are the obvious ones,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.Wall Street had expected the trade gap to narrow to $38 billion. When adjusted for inflation, the deficit widened to $54.7 billion from $48.7 billion in November.December's shortfall was wider than the government had assumed when it reported last week that gross domestic product had expanded at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. Trade was estimated to have subtracted 1.02 percentage point from GDP growth.Economists said it now appeared the drag on growth was bigger and they expect the government to lower the fourth-quarter growth estimate by as much as four-tenths of a percentage point when it publishes revisions later this month. On an inflation-adjusted trade-weighted basis, the dollar appreciated 5.3 percent last year.While trade is on the back foot, the labor market is weathering the strong dollar and the global slowdown.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 for the week ended Jan. 31, the Labor Department said in a separate report.The increase, which was less than economists' expectations for a rise to 290,000, left intact the bulk of the prior week's huge decline, which had taken claims to their lowest level since April 2000.U.S. stocks were trading higher, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell. FIRMING LABOR MARKET January's employment report to be released on Friday will likely show that nonfarm payrolls increased 234,000, according to a Reuters survey of economists, which would be the longest stretch of job gains above 200,000 since 1994.A firming labor market, together with lower gasoline prices, is seen bolstering consumer spending, which is expected to drive growth in early 2015.""We still believe the U.S. can remain an oasis of prosperity in the world even if international developments are starting to intrude a little on our buoyant forecasts for 2015,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. In a sign of the consumer-driven strengthening in domestic demand, imports rose 2.2 percent to $241.4 billion in December. The increase was in part due to a jump in petroleum imports, which hit their highest level since May 2013.The higher petroleum imports probably found their way into wholesale inventories and could prove temporary.""We suspect ... storage plays by domestic oil market participants, with a large number of oil investors racing to buy crude at lower prices and storing it amid contango plays,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.Imports of non-petroleum products surged to a record high, also reflecting the strength of the U.S. dollar.But with the dollar's rise, exports slipped 0.8 percent to $194.9 billion in December, an eight-month low.A range of companies, including Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, and Microsoft Corp  have warned that the dollar was hurting profits.Exports have been hurt by a labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports, which has been cited by some manufacturers as causing delays in the movement of goods.Exports to Canada and Mexico - the main U.S. trading partners - fell in December. In contrast, exports to Japan, China and the European Union rose in December.The politically sensitive U.S.-China trade deficit fell 5.5 percent to $28.3 billion.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)",2015-02-05,PG,"Thu Feb 5, 2015 | 11:11am EST",WRAPUP 2-U.S. trade deficit widens; weekly jobless claims up modestly,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0VF17B20150205?type=companyNews,-0.1199,0.082,0.833,0.085
263,"  (Adds reaction, details)By Corina Pons and Brian EllsworthCARACAS Feb 10 Venezuela on Tuesday launched a new foreign exchange platform that will likely devalue the bolivar heavily in efforts to bolster state coffers amid tumbling oil revenue, but risk a spike in already soaring inflation.The change amounts to an easing of 12-year-old currency controls and marks a small step toward market economics as the state-led model created by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez struggles with shortages, swelling grocery lines and recession.However, the changes by Nicolas Maduro's government do not eliminate the unwieldy three-tiered exchange structure seen by investors as the country's principal stumbling block to economic growth.The change will likely lead to billions of dollars in write-downs by foreign corporations with exposure to Venezuela including General Motors Co, household goods maker Procter & Gamble Co and drugmaker Merck & Co Inc.The new platform, called Marginal Currency System or Simadi, is the third system in a three-tier exchange control mechanism and will allow for legal trading of foreign currency based on supply and demand, said Finance Minister Rodolfo Marco.""This third mechanism is open, free, in which bidders and buyers exchange offers,"" Marco said during a press conference with Central Bank President Nelson Merentes.The currency controls have been providing U.S. dollars at three different rates: 6.3 bolivars for food and medicine, and two complementary rates of around 12 bolivars and 52 bolivars for other goods through systems known as Sicad I and Sicad II.But dollars fetch nearly 190 bolivars on the black market, according to widely referenced website dolartoday.com.Marco and Merentes did not offer details on what the open rate would be when the market kicks off in coming days. Merentes said the new platform would help lower the parallel rate. Brokerage sources consulted by Reuters say the rate could begin at around 120 bolivars, substantially lower then the black market but still more than double the lowest existing rate.A representative of the country's primary business organization, Fedecamaras, said via telephone that the group was still studying the measure and did not have immediate comment on how the country's businesses would be affected.SHORTAGES OF BASICS Opposition critics slammed the announcement as an insufficient measure that will do little to address the decaying economy, which one former government minister recently described as becoming the ""laughing-stock"" of the region.""If devaluation were the solution, we would be Switzerland!"" wrote opposition-leaning economist Miguel Angel Santos via Twitter, noting repeated devaluations during the 16 years of rule by the late Chavez and Maduro. The tumbling price of oil, which provides nearly all of Venezuela's hard currency, has left the 12-year-old exchange controls struggling to provide dollars to ensure steady supplies of such as detergent and milk that are increasingly going missing.Venezuela had the worst economic performance in Latin America last year with 2.8 percent GDP contraction and officially-estimated 64 percent inflation.Dismay over the state of the economy, and particularly of product shortages, has pushed Maduro's approval rating down to 22 percent, according to local pollster Datanalisis.A further spike in inflation due to the higher cost of imports could spur voter indignation and leave the ruling Socialist Party unable to maintain its majority in legislative elections to be held later this year.Both Marco and Merentes, however, denied there would be an inflationary impact. The Sicad I auction system will continue to hold periodic auctions for specific sectors of the economy and will for the moment continue providing dollars at the rate of 12, Marco said, adding that rate would change over time.The new Simadi market will replace the Sicad II system.Investors generally interpret devaluations positively because they leave the government with more hard currency available to service debt.Venezuelan bonds, which have been trading at distressed levels on fears of a possible default, were up across the board on Tuesday, with yields on several dropping to one-month lows.The Global 2026 bond was up 2.750 points in price to yield 26.841 percent while the Global 2022  rose 3.180 points to yield 31.717 percent.Equities investors face billions of dollars in write-downs by U.S. corporations with exposure to Venezuela, as many have been unable to repatriate bolivars back into dollars due to delays in the currency controls.At least 40 major U.S. companies together carry at least $11 billion of bolivar assets on their books, concentrated among 10 companies that have disclosed about $7.3 billion in assets linked to the country's currency system.Others foreign companies with notable exposure to Venezuela include Spain's Telefonica and Germany drugmaker Bayer .Some companies have already taken charges on their Venezuela exposure, including Kimberly Clark, Ford and Schlumberger. General Motors last week said in its annual report that instability in Venezuela could lead to a $900 million hit to earnings.The Coca-Cola Co said during a conference call on Tuesday that it expects Venezuela pricing provisions will continue to negatively impact net revenue.

264,"   By Corina Pons | CARACAS  CARACAS Feb 10 Venezuela on Tuesday will unveil a new foreign exchange system that is likely to ease the country's three-tiered currency controls but would also mean a hefty devaluation of the bolivar currency.Finance Minister Rodolfo Marco and Central Bank President Nelson Merentes were to hold a news conference at 11 a.m. local time (1030 EST/1530 GMT) on a ""new exchange scheme,"" the government said.The currency controls have been providing dollars at three different rates: 6.3 bolivars for food and medicine, and two complementary rates of around 12 bolivars and 52 bolivars for other goods through systems known as Sicad I and Sicad II.On the black market, the dollar is selling for nearly 190 bolivars, according to widely referenced website dolartoday.com. President Nicolas Maduro in January said the government would keep the preferential rate of 6.3 bolivars, maintain Sicad I at a yet-to-be-announced rate, and replace Sicad II with a new supply-and-demand driven platform.Brokerage operators who have been discussing the new system with officials told Reuters that the idea was to allow the bolivar to trade on that platform at a rate nearer the black market, at least double the current weakest level of 52.The operators said authorities were projecting the black market price could come down to between 120 and 140 bolivars once the third system opens. The Central Bank and state oil company PDVSA would be allowed to sell foreign currency via this mechanism, the sources said, with a projected daily offer of between $30 million and $45 million. The Central Bank would retain a power of veto over all operations, they added.The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the issue. Venezuela had the worst economic performance in Latin America last year with 2.8 percent GDP contraction and officially-estimated 64 percent inflation.The 12-year-old exchange controls have steadily reduced dollar disbursals amid declining oil prices, spurring shortages of products such as detergent and milk as companies have been unable to import machinery and raw materials.The new exchange rate is likely to affect U.S. corporate giants with exposure to Venezuela because the government has not allowed them to repatriate revenue from operations.At least 40 major U.S. companies, including General Motors Co, household goods maker Procter & Gamble Co and drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, together carry at least $11 billion of bolivar assets on their books.

265,"  (Updates with analyst comment, bond and CDS prices)By Brian Ellsworth and Daniel BasesCARACAS/NEW YORK Feb 11 Venezuela's dollar-denominated bonds tumbled on Wednesday after the government announced a new foreign exchange platform that was seen as insufficient to resolve an economic crisis and ease fears of a possible bond default.The OPEC nation on Tuesday unveiled a new free-floating currency platform called Simadi, the third system in a three-tier exchange control mechanism meant to bolster state coffers.Venezuela faces a potential gap in funding in 2015 given what it owes to foreigners holding U.S. dollar denominated debt.Siobhan Morden, a veteran emerging market debt strategist and head of Latin America strategy at Jeffries in New York believes the government needs to fill a $14 billion hole in its balance sheet in order to meet its obligations.""Maybe they can do something that is extremely creative that enables them to get through this year. But as it stands right now, with all the resources I am looking at, they are underfunded,"" said Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America strategy at Jefferies in New York.If President Nicolas Maduro can make it through this year, that funding gap increases to roughly $26 billion in 2016, Morden said.""Then they are absolutely, completely underfunded for 2016. But that is assuming they make it through this year. I would say there is still a high probability of default this year,"" she said.Critics pointed out that the changes to the 12-year-old currency control system did not remove two heavily over valued exchange rates, which will limit the government's ability to save hard currency amid a drastic fall in oil revenues. ""The persistence of large distortions in the FX market will make it more difficult for the government to make necessary savings in the new scenario of lower oil prices,"" wrote Alejandro Grisanti of Barclays. ""In such conditions, scarcity and inflation problems could continue to deepen.""Benchmark Venezuelan government debt fell sharply because the new plan underwhelmed the the market. Simadi was seen as marginal tinkering at best, even if it was a step in the right direction toward reform.Venezuela's Global 2027 bond fell 3.49 points in price to bid 40.005, driving the yield up to 25.12 percent. .An investor wanting to insure a $10 million portfolio of Venezuelan sovereign bonds for five years would need to spend $6.52 million upfront versus $6.32 million on Tuesday, according to data provider Markit.State-owned oil company PDVSA's bonds declined as well. It's benchmark 2024 bond dropped 1.36 points in price to bid 32.64, with yield up to nearly 25 percent. A plunge in oil prices has left Venezuela's state-led model created by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez struggling with shortages, swelling grocery lines and recession.The country's dollar-denominated bonds are now trading at distressed levels and on average their yields pay 27 percentage points more than similar U.S. Treasury bills due to concerns of a possible default.Maduro insists the country will meet all foreign debt commitments without cutting social spending plans or scrapping the currency control system.CORPORATE WRITE-DOWNS  Bonds had jumped on Tuesday in expectation that the new system would imply a large devaluation, which is generally viewed positively by bondholders because it frees up more hard currency for debt service.Officials did not say what the exchange rate would be on the new system, insisting it would be determined by supply and demand once the market kicks off in the coming days.Business leaders in Venezuela have given little detailed reaction to the change, though some said the free-floating mechanism was a welcome, albeit limited, move.""The government is recognizing that supply and demand must set prices,"" said Jorge Roig, head of the main business group Fedecamaras, in reference to the new system.""A bit of liberalism isn't a bad thing.""The three-tiered system will now comprise the preferential rate of 6.3 bolivars per dollar for food and medicine, a complementary rate of 12 bolivars for other goods through a system called Sicad, and the floating rate via Simadi.Local consultancy Ecoanalitica estimated the new rate would start between 130 and 140 bolivars.The group added that the weighted average exchange rate for 2015 would be 46.6 bolivars per dollar compared with 20.3 bolivars in 2014, which would imply a devaluation of 56 percent.That could force another round of hefty write-downs by foreign companies with exposure to Venezuela including General Motors Co, household goods maker Procter & Gamble Co  and Spanish telecom giant Telefonica.

PLUNGING REVENUES The tumbling price of oil, which provides nearly all of Venezuela's hard currency, has left the 12-year-old exchange controls struggling to provide dollars to ensure steady supplies of products such as detergent and milk that are increasingly scarce around Venezuela.Maduro, speaking late on Tuesday, said Venezuela's revenues had fallen 60 percent due to the oil price decline, and the country was ready for another two years of ""low or very low"" prices.However, all social welfare projects and foreign debt commitments, starting with the 1 billion euro Global 2015 issue  coming due on March 16, would be honored, his economic officials said.Venezuela had the worst economic performance in Latin America last year, with 2.8 percent GDP contraction and officially-estimated 64 percent inflation.Dismay over the state of the economy, and particularly of product shortages, has pushed Maduro's approval rating down to 22 percent, according to local pollster Datanalisis. ""Despite the fanfare that is likely to accompany the apparent shift towards a market-based foreign exchange system, we doubt that it will solve Venezuela's deep economic problems,"" Capital Economics said in a note on Tuesday's changes.A further spike in inflation, due to the higher cost of imports for businesses, could spur voter indignation and leave the ruling Socialist Party unable to maintain its majority in legislative elections to be held later this year.Both Marco and Merentes, however, denied there would be an inflationary impact. They said 70 percent of the economy's needs would be covered by dollars sold at the 6.3 rate.The Sicad I auction system will continue to hold periodic auctions for specific sectors of the economy and will for the moment continue providing dollars at the rate of 12, Marco said, adding that rate would change over time.The new Simadi market will replace the Sicad II system.Investors generally interpret devaluations positively because they leave the government with more hard currency available to service debt.Venezuelan bonds, which have been trading at distressed levels on fears of a possible default, were up across the board on Tuesday, with yields on several dropping to one-month lows.The Global 2026 bond was up 2.750 points in price to yield 26.841 percent while the Global 2022  rose 3.180 points to yield 31.717 percent.Equities investors face billions of dollars in write-downs by U.S. corporations with exposure to Venezuela, as many have been unable to repatriate bolivars back into dollars due to delays in the currency controls.At least 40 major U.S. companies together carry at least $11 billion of bolivar assets on their books, concentrated among 10 companies that have disclosed about $7.3 billion in assets linked to the country's currency system.Other foreign companies with notable exposure to Venezuela include Spain's Telefonica and German drugmaker Bayer .Some companies have already taken charges on their Venezuela exposure, including Kimberly Clark, Ford and Schlumberger.

271,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: P&G Beauty Division Divestment â€“ Block Sale to  Investment-Grade Peer Unlikely here MILAN/LONDON, April 09 (Fitch) Procter & Gamble's reported plan to divest a  large chunk of its USD20bn beauty division is unlikely to attract interest from  major competitors such as L'Oreal, Henkel, Unilever, Colgate and Kimberly Clark  if P&G wants to offload the business in a single sale, Fitch Ratings says in a  new report. But rivals would probably be interested in buying individual brands. According to media reports, P&G intends to retain several brands, such as  Pantene, that have leading shares and positive marketing momentum, and may  divest the remaining assets in one lot via an IPO or sale. We estimate that the  remaining assets lined up for divestment generate about USD8bn in revenues, and  at a conservative 15x EBITDA multiple could cost a buyer USD13bn-15bn.  This would be a hefty price for major competitors and the USD8bn in revenues  would be transformative for all but Unilever, which has roughly USD52bn total  revenues (including food). The assets probably would not be earnings accretive  as margins are lower than those of potential buyers, and therefore would be more  likely to negatively affect the would-be buyer's existing ratings. We therefore  do not think any major consumer industry companies have the capacity or  willingness to engage in an acquisition of this magnitude, particularly if it is  non-accretive. We therefore believe that if the assets were divested as a single block, an IPO  or a sale to a non-strategic buyer would be more likely. Unrated Coty Inc. could  also be a potential buyer as it is focussed on growth and has previously been  able to offer USD10.7bn for Avon Products.  We believe major rated consumer companies would be more interested in selective  acquisition of P&G brands, and several could remain near current ratings if they  made acquisitions with a price tag of around USD5bn. But even if buyers were  able to pick and choose a group of brands the price is likely to be high, and  require a meaningful level of debt financing and future cash draws for brand  support and integration.

A successful sale would allow P&G to focus on more profitable consumer brands such as its Gillette razors, Tide detergent and Pampers disposable diapers.Henkel is interested in buying P&G's haircare business, which includes the Wella and Clairol brands, the sources said, declining to be named because the matter is private. The haircare business is worth about $7 billion based on annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of around $500 million, the sources said. Revlon, the owner of makeup brands such as Almay, is eyeing P&G's cosmetics business, which includes drugstore brands CoverGirl and Max Factor. That business has annual EBITDA of around $350 million, the people said. Coty, which makes perfume for fashion brands Calvin Klein and Marc Jacobs and owns nail polish brand OPI and Rimmel mascara, is likely interested in P&G's fragrance unit, though it could also look at buying P&G's cosmetics business as well, the sources said.  P&G's fragrance unit includes brands such as Hugo Boss and Gucci and has EBITDA of around $250 million, they said. It remains unclear whether P&G will try to sell its brands as part of a package, whose value could range from $10 billion to $12 billion, or piecemeal. P&G could also decide to scrap the sale entirely and instead look to spin off the unit, the sources added.  Representatives for P&G and Revlon declined to comment. Coty and Henkel did not respond to requests for comment. P&G is looking to sell some of its beauty brands as part of a cost-cutting strategy by Chief Executive Officer A.G. Lafley. Lafley said in August he would reverse the Cincinnati-based company's strategy of aggressive expansion and shed more than half its brands. P&G said it would concentrate on 70 to 80 brands that have accounted for 90 percent of its sales over the past three years. P&G has already divested some of its non-core brands. Last year, the company sold its Duracell battery brand to Berkshire Hathaway Inc for $4.7 billion in stock and also sold some of its soap brands to Unilever PLC.

273,"   By Lucia Mutikani | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON U.S. industrial output posted its biggest drop in more than 2-1/2 years in March in part as oil and gas well drilling plummeted, highlighting the negative impact of lower crude prices and a strong dollar on the economy.The dour report from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday was the latest sign that growth slowed sharply in the first quarter and suggested the U.S. central bank could delay raising interest rates until later this year. Snowy winter weighed on activity early in 2015. Labor disruptions at normally busy West Coast ports, as well as the dollar and softer global demand have been a constraint.""This provides some confirmation on the disappointing growth performance in the first quarter. The absence of a lift in the other forward-looking indicators suggests that the U.S. economic recovery is struggling to regain any traction,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York. Industrial production fell 0.6 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in February, the Fed said. March's decline was the largest since August 2012 and was worse than economists' expectations for only a 0.3 percent drop.A 17.7 percent plunge in oil and gas well drilling pulled mining production down 0.7 percent in March, marking the third straight month of declines in mining output. Crude oil has lost more than half of its value since last June, resulting in a sharp drop in well drilling activity. Companies in the oil field are also either postponing or cutting back on capital expenditure projects.Separately, the Fed in its Beige Book report of anecdotal information on business activity collected from contacts nationwide said investment in oil and gas drilling had declined and related layoffs were reported by ""multiple"" regions. Caterpillar Inc early this year cut its 2015 profit outlook and warned lower oil prices would hurt its energy equipment business.Last month, utilities production tumbled 5.9 percent, also weighing on industrial production. ""We do not see the emerging picture as supporting the hand of those who have been arguing for an earlier Fed rate hike,"" said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak in New York.Most economists have pushed back their expectations for the first rate hike to either September or October from June. Others believe monetary policy will only be tightened in 2016. The Fed has kept interest rates near zero since December 2008.

While manufacturing output ticked up 0.1 percent in March, the first gain since last November, it fell at a 1.2 percent rate in the first quarter, the first decline since the second quarter of 2009.

276,"  (Adds events for Verizon, AT&T, Canadian National Railway and Rogers Communications)Week AheadA slew of Dow 30 companies report results in the week: Chemicals conglomerate DuPont, industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp, property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies Inc and wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday; McDonald's Corp, AT&T Inc, Boeing Co and Coca-Cola Co on Wednesday; and diversified manufacturer 3M Co, Procter & Gamble and Microsoft Corp on Thursday. While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc's first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon's upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T's proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's new CEO, is charged with reviving the company's falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M's first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy.Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google's future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again.Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street's expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world's largest social network's business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company's next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company's outlook for the remainder of 2015.On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices.On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines. Analysts and investors will be looking out for any details on the tax-free sale of its Alibaba shares.General Motors Co reports first-quarter results before the market opens on Thursday. Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before.On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts' average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer's flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that ""challenges"" with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business.Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes.Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. Also, data for new home sales is expected to be released on Thursday. On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases data for durable goods.Starbucks Corp reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry's top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working.On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum's China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from ""brand fatigue"" in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules. The company says customers have simply switched to other meats and that it isn't losing sales - but investors will be on alert for any signs of a slowdown.Drugmaker Biogen Inc is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Friday, driven by strong sales of its top-selling oral MS drug, Tecfidera, which has seen burgeoning sales since its launch in 2013. Biogen, which leads the United States multiple sclerosis market with five drugs for the condition, recently reported promising data for its Alzheimer's drug. Investors will also be looking for commentary on Tecfider's growth expectations, and potential for competition, as well as the longer-acting MS injectable Plegridy.AbbVie Inc, whose planned $21 billion acquisition of Pharmacyclics Inc is meant to lessen the company's dependence on its blockbuster Humira arthritis drug, is expected to report sharply higher earnings and sales for the first quarter on Thursday, fueled by Humira's continuing growth and sales of the company's recently approved Viekira Pak treatment for hepatitis C. Investors will be keen for details on sales prospects for Viekira Pak, given steep price discounts AbbVie has given to compete with Gilead Science Inc's potent treatments for the liver disease.Eli Lilly and Co is expected to report higher first-quarter earnings on Thursday as the Indianapolis drugmaker begins to recover from patent expirations that slashed demand for its biggest products. The company is well positioned to deliver a promised return to profit growth this year, helped by new treatments for cancer and diabetes and growing sales of its animal health brands.Abbott Laboratories will report its first-quarter earnings on Wednesday. Recovering sales of Abbott Laboratories' infant formulas, following costly recalls in Asia, and improving performance of the company's branded generic medicines, are expected to drive quarterly earnings growth despite the negative impact of the stronger dollar.Ebay Inc is expected to report results for the first quarter largely in line with Wall Street expectations on Wednesday. The company has seen strong growth in payments business as well as its non-auction e-commerce business. Analysts expect that the company will continue to benefit from the rise in demand for mobile devices, as consumers increasingly use their smart phones and tablets to shop online. Investors will look for details on the company's plans for the spinoff of PayPal scheduled for the second half of 2015.On Thursday, Dow Chemical Co is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit due to a stronger dollar and a slowdown in its agricultural business. The company last month said it would offload a bulk of its low-margin bleach and vinyl-related business to Olin in a $5 billion. Investors will be looking for further comments on the company's cost-saving plans. Johnson Controls Inc, the auto parts supplier and maker of climate control systems for buildings, is expected to report higher second-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by higher sales in its seating and interiors business as auto sales and production rose in the first quarter. The company's buildings efficiency business, which provides air conditioning equipment and building management services, is also expected to report higher revenue as U.S. office vacancy rate declined to its lowest level since the third quarter to 2009. Investors will be looking for comments on Johnson Controls' business focus and outlook following the sale of its workplace solutions business to CBRE Group.Pentagon's No. 1 arms supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, reports first-quarter results on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin has been focusing on increasing sales to commercial customers in United States as well as international governments to make up for pressures from tight U.S. defense spending. Lockheed gets 17 percent of its revenue from international markets and 1 percent from U.S. commercial customers. Investors will be looking to see if Lockheed still expects U.S. military spending to meaningfully pick up this year.Weapons maker Raytheon Co has increased exposure to international markets, which account for about 27 percent of its total sales, as U.S. defense spending remains tight. The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system forecast disappointing 2015 revenue in January as domestic orders remained weak. When the company will report its first-quarter results on Thursday, investors will be looking for an update on a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that Raytheon expected to win in the first quarter.On Tuesday, Omnicom Group Inc, the No. 1 U.S. advertising company, is expected to report first-quarter results largely in-line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Omnicom had warned that a strong dollar would hit revenue this year. Omnicom, whose clients include Apple, McDonald's and Adidas, gets a little less than half of its revenue from outside the United States. On Friday, Interpublic Group of Companies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' average estimate according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company's previous quarter was helped by higher ad spending by businesses in the United States.On Tuesday, chipmaker Broadcom Corp is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect the company's connectivity business to sequentially decline as it comes off a strong Apple-driven fourth quarter. Analysts will be looking for the company to provide outlook for the quarter ending June.On Wednesday, data storage company EMC Corp is expected to report first-quarter profit and revenue below analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had in January forecast a lower-than-expected profit for 2015 and said it would cut jobs. The company, which earns nearly half of its revenue from international markets, is expected to be hurt by a strong dollar. Analysts say enterprise storage demand has been mixed in quarter which may hurt EMC.Virtualization software maker VMware Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, hurt by a stronger dollar. More than 48 percent of VMware's revenue comes from outside the United States. Analysts at Wells Fargo estimate a negative impact of 3-4 percent from foreign currency on license revenue growth.Programmable chip maker Xilinx Inc will report fourth-quarter results after markets close on Wednesday. The company, which dominates the programmable chip market along with Altera Corp, is expected to report profit and revenue that are largely in line with analyst expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data.

Coming on the heels of larger peer D.R. Horton's second-quarter results on Wednesday, PulteGroup's results are expected to provide further evidence of a strong spring selling season this year, suggesting that a slowdown in housing starts in the first three months did not point to underlying weakness in the U.S. housing market.Steelmaker Nucor Corp will report first-quarter results on Thursday. Nucor has been struggling with lower selling prices due to high levels of imports. Declining oil prices have also led to excess inventory in Nucor's pipe and tube business. Analysts will be looking for comments on inventory, steel demand and overcapacity in its steel mills business. On Thursday, Patterson-UTI Energy Inc, the second-largest land driller in North America, is expected to report a lower first-quarter profit as weak oil prices weigh on drilling activity. Patterson, which halved its rig construction program for this year, had warned that 2015 would be ""challenging,"" having received indications that customers could terminate a number of longer-term contracts early. Investors will be looking for updates on further cost saving measures and commentary on contracts and dayrates for its 16 new high-tech Apex rigs, which analysts believe could help the driller boost cash margins this year.Contract driller Nabors Industries Ltd, which is merging with C&J Energy, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as drilling activity continues to be hurt by the fall in oil prices. The company has already warned of weak activity and pricing pressure in its international operations.

However, higher input costs and a stronger dollar could have hurt profit. The company said in February it would transfer pension obligations to two insurers to reduce risk and will take a charge in the second quarter. It had also warned of an 8-9 percent drop in 2015 sales hurt by the dollar and weak demand for core products such as Huggies diapers. Investors will be looking for any updates on forecast on Tuesday.Hershey Co, the maker of Hershey's Kisses and Reese's peanut butter cups, has been struggling with high cocoa and dairy costs and intense competition from rivals such as Mondelez and Mars. To tackle growing competition, the company has been pouring money in advertisements and promotions, but this is expected to hurt its full-year earnings per share by 2 percentage points. It has also tried to diversify and add a new stream of revenue by acquiring jerky maker Krave Pure Foods Inc in January, marking its first foray into meat snacks. When the company will report its first-quarter profit on Thursday, investors will be looking out for comments on whether the company will make more acquisitions in the meat and bakery snacks category, which are becoming more popular than candy, and the effect of the strong dollar on its outlook.Dunkin' Brands Group Inc will report its first-quarter results on Thursday. Investors will be looking at how much Boston's record snowfall hurt results at Dunkin Brands, whose Dunkin' Donuts shops are concentrated in the U.S. northeast. Experts say the impact could be meaningful.Under Armour Inc, a sports apparel and footwear maker, is expected to report profit and sales for the first quarter in line with analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts expect Under Armour to continue its 19-quarter streak of reporting more than 20 percent growth in revenue, helped by expanded offerings in sport and outdoor clothing, strong demand for its Speedform Apollo running shoes, new launches in basketball footwear and sponsorship deals. The company is also expected to benefit from investments in its fast-growing digital platform and from the acquisitions of fitness tracking apps Endomondo and MyFitnessPal. When the company will report on Tuesday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and color on the performance of new launches in footwear.Hanesbrands Inc, the innerwear and apparel maker is expected to report first-quarter profit and sales above analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Analysts are projecting first-quarter sales growth of more than 15 percent as the company benefits from higher sales of sport and gym clothing at department stores, and the acquisition of DBApparel and Maidenform Brands. When the company reports on Thursday, investors will look for an update to the full-year forecast and more color on the company's recent acquisition of college logo clothing maker Knights Apparel.Ingersoll-Rand Plc, the maker of Trane air conditioners and Thermo King refrigeration units, is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit on Thursday, driven by growth in global industrial and construction markets.

Investors will also be looking for an update on how much the weakness in oil prices has hurt the company's newly acquired centrifugal compression business.Xerox Corp, which has been shifting its focus to IT services from making printers and copiers, is expected to report first-quarter revenue that is slightly below analysts' estimate on Friday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Xerox had cut its profit forecast for 2015 for the second time after reporting its sixth-consecutive drop in revenue last quarter. In December, the company agreed to sell its IT outsourcing arm to Atos. Teck Resources Ltd, Canada's largest diversified miner, is expected to report on Tuesday a lower profit in the first quarter as prices for both copper and steel-making coal remain depressed amid a fall in demand. The company in March denied media reports that it was in talks to merge with Chilean copper producer Antofagasta. Teck CEO also refuted speculations of a possible merger with HudBay Minerals or an acquisition of Zaldivar, a copper mine owned by Barrick Gold. Teck said in February it might reduce its dividend in July if the industry-wide production cuts fail to boost coal prices. Investors will be interested in any comments of a possible merger or acquisition and demand for steel-making coal.Car seat maker Lear Corp is expected to report higher first-quarter profit on Friday helped by strong demand in North America and a rise in vehicle production. Some analysts expect Lear to benefit from cheaper commodity prices and report higher margins. Investors will look for Lear's comments on Mercato Capital seeking a split of the auto parts suppliers businesses.Investment bank and asset manager Lazard Ltd reports first-quarter earnings on Thursday. Lazard is expected to benefit from a jump in corporate dealmaking, which should have boosted its M&A advisory business. Globally, deals worth $811.8 billion were announced in the first quarter, up 21 percent, compared to a year earlier. Among them, Lazard advised on the merger of Heinz-Kraft and the sale of Serbia's state-operated Telekom Srbija. However, analysts expect lower-than-anticipated deal completions to weigh on the company's quarterly revenue. Lazard has been focusing more on asset management to be less reliant on financial advisory fees.AutoNation Inc, the largest U.S. car dealer chain, reports first-quarter results on Wednesday. Investors will be watching margins on new car sales, any potential expansion moves and for any concerns about U.S. consumer spending going forward.On Thursday, Qlik Technologies Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue above analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, on higher demand for its data analytics software.

The company primarily offers application interface management and predictive analysis services.On Tuesday, Canadian Finance Minister Joe Oliver will present the annual federal budget for the fiscal year that began on April 1, the last budget before the general election scheduled for October.

284,"  (Adds details, analyst comments, updates markets)* Core capital goods orders fall 0.5 percent in March* Core capital goods shipments slip 0.4 percent* Durable goods orders jump 4.0 percent on transportationBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, April 24 U.S. business investment spending plans fell for a seventh straight month in March, weighed down by a strong dollar and lower energy prices, suggesting the economy was struggling to rebound from a recent soft patch.The report from the Commerce Department on Friday came on the heels of lukewarm data on retail sales, employment and housing starts that have hinted at insufficient growth momentum that could prompt the Federal Reserve to delay raising interest rates until later this year.""This is consistent with a sluggish rebound in growth. It's shedding more doubt on the Fed's willingness to raise rates mid-year,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an economist at TD Securities in New York.Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, declined 0.5 percent last month after a revised 2.2 percent drop in February, which was the biggest decline since July 2013.The so-called core capital goods orders were previously reported to have declined 1.1 percent in February. Economists had forecast these orders gaining 0.3 percent last month. The weakness mirrors other manufacturing indicators such as industrial production and various regional factory surveys.The dollar fell against a basket of currencies after the report, while prices for U.S. government debt rose. U.S. stocks were trading marginally higher as investors were cheered by strong results from Google Inc, Amazon.com Inc  and Microsoft Corp.The Fed has kept overnight interest rates near zero since December 2008, but a number of officials have said an increase will likely be considered at its June policy-setting meeting.MANUFACTURING STRUGGLING  Manufacturing has been undermined by the buoyant dollar, whose 12.1 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since last June has eroded overseas profits of multinational companies like Procter & Gamble Co.The world's largest household products maker on Thursday reported a 8.3 percent decline in quarterly sales.In addition, lower energy prices have cut into domestic oil production, reducing demand for equipment by oil-field companies, including Schlumberger and Halliburton .Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oil-field services provider, has cut its capital expenditure plans for this year by about $500 million to $2.5 billion. Halliburton slashed its capex by about 15 percent to $2.8 billion.""Cheap oil and a strong dollar, while beneficial to consumers, are putting serious pressure on manufacturers,"" said Jay Morelock, an economist at FTN Financial in New York. The dollar and reduced capex spending by oil-field firms combined with a harsh winter and softer global demand to slow U.S. growth at the start of the year.In March, shipments of core capital goods - which are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement - fell 0.4 percent after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in February.Shipments in February were previously reported to have risen 0.3 percent. As a result, JPMorgan lowered its first-quarter GDP growth estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 0.6 percent annual pace.Barclays trimmed its forecast to a 1.1 percent rate from a 1.2 percent pace. The economy expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The government will publish its snapshot of first-quarter GDP next Wednesday.Pointing to prolonged weakness in manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, unfilled orders for core capital goods fell for a second straight month in March after barely rising in January.""We have not seen the full ramifications of the strong dollar and the drop in oil-related investment, so that could continue to play out,"" said Thomas Costerg, a U.S. economist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. ""The focus is now on services and consumers in the hope that they are going to pick up the tab. So far we are not seeing signs of that.""A surge in transportation equipment buoyed overall orders for durable goods - items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more - which rebounded 4.0 percent last month. That was the largest increase since July last year and followed a 1.4 percent decline in February.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",2015-04-24,PG,"Fri Apr 24, 2015 | 12:25pm EDT",WRAPUP 2-Weak U.S. business spending data hints at sluggish growth rebound,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0XL0OC20150424?type=companyNews,0.9812,0.073,0.819,0.108
285,"  (Recasts with final auto sales data)* Manufacturing activity muted, strong dollar cited* Auto sales slow in April after March's robust pace* Consumer sentiment rises in April from March* Construction spending hits six-month low in MarchBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, May 1 U.S. factory activity failed to gain steam in April after slowing for five straight months and demand for automobiles softened, suggesting the economy was struggling to find momentum after growth almost stalled in the first quarter.Other data on Friday showed construction spending hit a six-month low in March, also indicating that the anticipated acceleration in growth in the second quarter could disappoint.   That could see the Federal Reserve delaying raising interest rates until later this year.The economy expanded at a 0.2 percent annual pace in the first three months of the year, slammed by bad weather, a strong dollar and a now-resolved labor dispute at the West Coast ports, as well as lower oil prices, which have undercut domestic energy production.""The reacceleration in growth will not come fast enough for many, especially those looking for a liftoff by the Fed to happen sooner,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in New York. The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity was at 51.5 in April, matching the March reading, which had been the lowest since May 2013.The index had declined since November and economists had expected it to rise to 52 in April. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing sector.While new orders rose last month, a gauge of factory employment contracted for the first time since May 2013 and recorded its lowest reading since September 2009.Manufacturing has been hit by the dollar's 12 percent appreciation against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June.The buoyant currency has hurt export growth and profits of multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co , the world's largest household products maker, and prompted Colgate-Palmolive and healthcare conglomerate  Johnson & Johnson to cut their profit forecasts for the full year. Whirlpool Corp, the world's largest maker of home appliances, lowered its profit forecast and sales outlook for 2015.Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, is also being pressured by the lower oil prices, which have caused oil-field companies to slash spending on exploration and well drilling.Caterpillar Inc has warned the dollar and weak oil prices will hurt profits this year.U.S. stocks closed higher. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury debt prices fell. REGAINING FOOTING Separately, auto sales fell to an annualized pace of 16.45 million vehicles last month from a 17.15 million-unit rate in March. However, General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co  reported stronger-than-expected U.S. auto sales in April on robust demand for trucks, and crossover and sports utility vehicles.Demand for autos is likely to pick up in the months ahead. In another report, the University of Michigan said its overall index on consumer sentiment rose to 95.9 this month, the second highest level since 2007, from 93.0 in March.Consumers were upbeat about both current conditions and expectations for the future. More consumers said it was a good time to buy a major household item and a vehicle. There was also an increase in consumers saying it was a good time to buy and sell a house, which should support home sales.""This suggests that there may be some upside risk for durable goods spending in the second quarter ... and that perhaps housing market activity will pick up in the months ahead,"" said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.In a fourth report, the Commerce Department said construction spending slipped 0.6 percent to an annual rate of $966.6 billion in March, the lowest level since September.Construction spending was weighed down by a 1.6 percent decline in private residential construction spending, the biggest such decline since June. Public construction outlays were also weak.""We think the outlook for residential construction is positive in 2015 as household formation appears to have picked up and as house price gains have remained firm,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao and Andrea Ricci)",2015-05-01,PG,"Fri May 1, 2015 | 4:50pm EDT",WRAPUP 3-Anemic U.S. factory data points to moderate growth bounce,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0XS0V820150501?type=companyNews,0.9674,0.078,0.816,0.106
286,"  (Adds details, background, analyst comments, updates markets)* Factory orders rise 2.1 percent on transportation* Orders excluding transportation unchanged* March core capital goods orders revised upBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, May 4 New orders for U.S. factory goods recorded their biggest increase in eight months in March, boosted by demand for transportation equipment, but the underlying trend remained weak against the backdrop of a strong dollar.The report on Monday from the Commerce Department was the latest indication that the rebound from the first quarter's abrupt slowdown would not be as strong as experienced during the same period last year when output was chilled by cold weather.""It was a difficult winter for manufacturers and it appears they are still hurting after the strong run in the dollar late last year,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. New orders for manufactured goods increased 2.1 percent, the largest gain since July last year, after dipping 0.1 percent in February. It was the first rise since last August and was buoyed by a 13.5 percent jump in orders for transportation equipment.Orders excluding transportation were flat in March. February's 0.1 percent gain in orders for manufactured goods outside transportation was the first rise since June.The dollar rose against a basket of currencies while prices for U.S. Treasury debt fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with healthcare shares leading the way.Manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the U.S. economy, has been hit by the strong dollar and lower crude oil prices, which are putting a squeeze on the profits of multinational corporations and oil firms. That together with harsh weather and a now-settled labor dispute at the West Coast ports helped to hold the economy down to a 0.2 percent annual growth pace in the first quarter.The factory data added to reports on auto sales, housing and employment in suggesting the economy was regaining some speed, but probably not fast enough to encourage the Federal Reserve to start raising interest rates next month, as most economists had anticipated at the beginning of the year.The dollar has appreciated 12 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June on expectations of tighter monetary policy and economists estimate it could shave 0.6 percentage point off growth this year.Companies like Schlumberger, the world's No.1 oil-field services provider, and Halliburton have slashed their capital expenditure for this year citing lower oil prices. Multinational corporations, including Procter & Gamble Co , the world's largest household products maker, Colgate-Palmolive and Whirlpool Corp, the world's largest maker of home appliances, have lowered their profit forecasts for the year because of the dollar.The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - edged up 0.1 percent instead of the 0.5 percent drop reported last month.""Seldom do things look this bad for the factory sector outside of recession,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.""We still maintain that things will improve as the year progresses. The bulk of the declines in activity related to lower energy prices has run its course, baring another significant down leg for oil prices.""Supporting the cautious optimism, order books at factories  rose a bit in March after three straight months of declines.Further gains are likely after a report last week showed some stabilization in factory activity in April after slowing for five straight months, as well as a solid rise in new orders.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci)",2015-05-04,PG,"Mon May 4, 2015 | 1:23pm EDT","WRAPUP 2-U.S. factory orders rebound solidly, but trend still soft",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0XV0WQ20150504?type=companyNews,0.9954,0.077,0.766,0.157
287,"  * Private equity mentality spreads in consumer sector* Highlights importance of financial prowess* JAB, Nomad Foods have links to 3G-controlled AB InBevBy Martinne GellerLONDON, May 21 The consumer goods world has long been dominated by marketing whiz kids raised through the ranks of Procter & Gamble or PepsiCo, but the executives now in demand come from a new school that values cost-cutting and mergers over marketing.The new playbook, embodied by U.S. private equity firm 3G Capital, applies cutthroat Wall Street sensibilities to Main Street shopping aisles, demanding the highest performance from  fewer people willing to work extra hard and progress quickly.The spread of a private equity mentality to more of the largest names in the sector exacerbates the pressure on finance chiefs, already wading through increased volatility of commodities and currencies, and highlights the need for financial prowess outside the finance department.The 3G management philosophy was developed by three Brazilian investment bankers and pioneered at Budweiser brewer Anheuser Busch InBev, the world's biggest brewer, which they helped create through a series of big mergers. It is now also in effect at Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International where they are major shareholders, and ketchup maker Heinz which they have bought. Soon it will arrive at Kraft Foods, which is being bought by Heinz.The Brazilians have demonstrated that the private equity model can be implemented on a large scale, potentially creating big winners and losers in a low-growth sector.Private equity firms in general are known for a more aggressive culture than marketing-focused consumer goods companies, with more competition and a higher turnover rate among executives, said Gary Stibel, CEO of New England Consulting Group. He said more consumer firms are adopting some of those philosophies, but it is not always a good fit.""They have a maniacal focus on cash and results,"" Stibel said. ""You've got to be very careful about putting a bull in a china shop unless you're prepared to have a lot of broken glass.""After 3G teamed up with billionaire investor Warren Buffett to buy Heinz in 2013, they closed six factories and cut 7,000 jobs in 18 months. Operating margins jumped from 18 percent to 26 percent. Part of the 3G playbook is zero-based budgeting (ZBB), which forces managers to justify each year's costs from scratch rather than assume the previous year's budget as a starting point.While 3G is often seen as extreme - at Heinz they limited employee use of company printers to 200 pages per month, required double-sided printing - ZBB is being adopted elsewhere, such as at Cadbury chocolate maker Mondelez International .Executives familiar with the strategy are in demand as other companies seek to repeat the trick.""Anyone who worked at ABI (AB InBev) or Heinz under the 3G regime would be very appealing to the market, because of their familiarity with ZBB,"" said Fabio Vacirca, head of the consumer goods and services group at consultancy Accenture.As industry-wide sales have slowed for packaged food makers such as Kellogg, Campbell Soup and General Mills , all eyes have turned to profits.3G's founders Jorge Paulo Lemann, Marcel Telles and Carlos Alberto Sicupira developed their management style at Banco Garantia, the investment bank they founded in Brazil in the 1970s. After selling it to Credit Suisse in 1998, they formed private equity firm 3G to invest in U.S. consumer names. Lemann, Brazil's richest man and a former tennis pro, once served on the board of Gillette, where he met Buffett, who has partnered with Lemann on Heinz and Kraft and has said he would like to do more deals.CFO TURNOVER A shakeup in finance departments throughout the packaged goods sector suggests the emphasis on dealmaking and cost-cutting is putting new pressure on a side of the business that used to take a back seat to marketing.Unilever announced the departure of its chief financial officer Jean-Marc Huet on Tuesday, becoming the fifth major consumer products firm to change the post in recent months, following Heineken, Danone, Nestle  and SABMiller.""Maybe it is just becoming a more pressurized and intense job as the CFOs are being required to actually become more operationally involved in all that cost-cutting rather than just adding up the numbers,"" said one investment bank analyst covering the sector, who declined to be identified by name. Since the credit crunch, companies have been increasingly naming finance experts as CEOs and board members, ""because it's been more about management of those risks as opposed to the more expansive agenda that perhaps marketeers had traditionally been better suited to,"" said Will Hayllar, co-leader of the global consumer goods team at OC&C Strategy Consultants.Dealmaking activity is requiring a lot of attention from top executives, SABMiller's interim CFO, Domenic De Lorenzo, told reporters last week: ""Conversations, evaluations, looking at transactions, that's still a big part of everyone's day-to-day job in this industry.""Many of the dealmakers and financiers taking up top jobs in the industry have outright connections to 3G and AB InBev.Stefan Descheemaeker, the executive who led Belgium's Interbrew into the merger that formed the precursor to AB InBev, will soon take charge of Birdseye frozen foods owner Iglo Foods as the new CEO of acquisition firm Nomad Holdings.Olivier Goudet, a veteran of the 2008 takeover of Wrigley by Mars, has been named as both the new chairman of AB InBev and as CEO at JAB Holdings, the family office of the German billionaire Reimann family which is putting together the world's largest pure-play coffee company. JAB's former CEO Peter Harf also served as AB InBev chairman.The tumult helps the sector to be seen as a hot field for aspiring managers. Work in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sector became the most popular destination for business students last year, eclipsing banking for the first time, according to a global survey by Deloitte.Deloitte's Margaret Doyle, who worked on the report, pointed to an increased number of female students, who she said often lean toward marketing jobs, and a weakening of the banking industry, whose reputation was bruised by the financial crisis.""FMCG companies have always been perceived as having well-regarded graduate programmes,"" said Doyle, head of financial services insight at Deloitte. ""People are initiated through different parts of the business - they get to market shampoo, market washing powder, they experience a real rotation which is a great foundation.""Procter & Gamble for decades was seen as one of the best breeding grounds for business executives, due to its world-class talent programme and reputation for promoting from within. Aside from consumer leaders like Unilever CEO Paul Polman and Estee Lauder CEO Fabrizio Freda, P&G alums include General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt and former Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer.Yet industry bankers said they could they could see why new graduates might like to work for 3G, despite its culture being so thrifty that even top executives abide by restrictions on travel and entertainment.""Come to them, and they'll teach you as much about consumer products marketing as anyone else, but they'll also show you how to develop that playbook,"" said one banker.

290,"  (Adds consumer sentiment, factory data, updates markets)* First-quarter GDP revised down to show contraction* GDP shrinks at a 0.7 percent annual rate* Trade, inventories account for bulk of revision* Strong dollar weighs on Q1 corporate profitsBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, May 29 The U.S. economy contracted in the first quarter as it buckled under the weight of unusually heavy snowfalls, a resurgent dollar and disruptions at West Coast ports, but activity already has rebounded modestly.The government on Friday slashed its gross domestic product estimate to show GDP shrinking at a 0.7 percent annual rate instead of the 0.2 percent growth pace it estimated last month.A larger trade deficit and a smaller accumulation of inventories by businesses than previously thought accounted for much of the downward revision. There was also a modest downward revision to consumer spending.With growth estimates for the second quarter currently around 2 percent, the economy appears poised for its worst first-half performance since 2011. The economy's recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis has been erratic.Weak data on consumer sentiment and factory activity in the Midwest on Friday suggested that while the economy has pulled out of its first-quarter soft patch, the growth pace was modest early in the second quarter. That mirrored other recent soft data on retail sales and industrial production.But reports on housing and business spending plans have indicated momentum could be building, which would keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates later this year. Economists caution against reading too much into the slump in output. They argue the GDP figure for the first quarter was held down by a confluence of temporary factors, including a problem with the model the government uses to smooth the data for seasonal fluctuations.Economists, including those at the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, have cast doubts on the accuracy of GDP estimates for the first quarter, which have tended to show weakness over the last several years.They argued the so-called seasonal adjustment is not fully stripping out seasonal patterns, leaving ""residual"" seasonality. The government said last week it was aware of the potential problem and was working to minimize it.""Obviously the economy is weaker than we would like it to be, but the first quarter overstates that,"" said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica in Dallas. ""We're going see enough growth to keep job creation in place and allow the Fed to maintain their lift-off schedule for September.""When measured from the income side, the economy expanded at a 1.4 percent rate in the first quarter. A measure of domestic demand growth was revised up slightly and business spending on equipment was much stronger than previously estimated, taking some edge off the slump in output.U.S. Treasuries were trading higher, while the dollar was largely unchanged against a basket of currencies. Stocks on Wall Street fell. DOLLAR, ENERGY DRAG Apart from the statistical quirk, the economy, which expanded at a 2.2 percent pace in the fourth quarter, was hammered by a sharp decline in investment spending in the energy sector as companies such as Schlumberger and Halliburton  responded to the plunge in crude oil prices.Spending on mining exploration, shafts and wells plunged at a 48.6 percent pace in the first quarter, the largest drop since the second quarter of 2009.Economists estimate unusually heavy snowfalls in February chopped at least one percentage point from growth.Trade was hit both by the strong dollar and the ports labor dispute, which weighed on exports through the quarter and then unleashed a flood of imports in March after it was resolved. That resulted in a trade deficit that subtracted 1.90 percentage points from GDP, the largest drag in 31 years, instead of the 1.25 percentage points reported last month.The GDP report also showed after-tax corporate profits declined 8.7 percent. That was the largest drop in a year and the second quarterly fall, as the strong dollar burdened multinational corporations and oil prices hurt domestic firms.Multinationals like Microsoft Corp, household products maker Procter & Gamble Co and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.Unlike 2014, when growth snapped back quickly after a dismal first quarter, the dollar and investment cuts by energy companies continue to hamstring activity.But growth could accelerate as the year progresses.The value of inventory accumulated in the first quarter was revised down to an increase of $95 billion from the lofty $110.3 billion rise reported last month.That meant inventories contributed 0.33 percentage point to GDP instead of the previously reported 0.74 percentage point, suggesting warehouses are not bulging with unwanted merchandise and businesses have latitude to order more goods from factories.While consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, was revised down by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.8 percent rate, it could finally get a lift from the considerable savings households amassed because of cheaper gasoline.Personal savings increased at a robust $726.4 billion pace.""The outlook for the economy is very encouraging,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)",2015-05-29,PG,"Fri May 29, 2015 | 11:56am EDT",WRAPUP 4-U.S. economy contracts in Q1; dollar hurts corporate profits,http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSLNNTGEBB220150529?type=companyNews,0.0256,0.096,0.803,0.101

297,"  (Adds details, housing data, updates markets)* Industrial production falls 0.2 percent in May* Manufacturing output slips 0.2 percent* Mining production drops 0.3 percent* New York state factory activity gauge falls in JuneBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, June 15 U.S. industrial production unexpectedly fell in May as manufacturing and mining activity remained weak, a sign that a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector continued to constrain economic growth.The softness in the production side of the economy contrasts starkly with recent upbeat data on retail sales, employment, consumer and small business confidence, which have pointed to a growth pickup after a sluggish start to the second quarter.""Signs of spring remain largely absent in the industrial sector. The challenges of the stronger dollar and drop in energy  prices linger,"" said Tim Quinlan, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.Industrial output slipped 0.2 percent last month after declining 0.5 percent in April, the Federal Reserve said on Monday. Industrial production has been weak since December, and  economists had expected output to rise 0.2 percent last month.The data was likely to get the attention of Fed policymakers who meet on Tuesday and Wednesday, economists said.The U.S. central bank is not expected to raise interest rates at this week's policy meeting, but rather to wait until later this year. Industrial production last month was held down by a 0.2 percent drop in manufacturing output. Manufacturing has been whacked by a strong dollar, which has eroded the profits of multinational corporations.Companies like Microsoft Corp and Procter & Gamble Co, the world's largest household products maker, and healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson have warned the dollar will hit sales and profits this year.The dollar has gained about 13.2 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since last June largely on expectations of tighter U.S. monetary policy.U.S. financial markets were little moved by Monday's data as investors kept a wary eye on Greece, which inched closer to defaulting on its debt. U.S. stocks were trading lower, while the dollar slipped against a basket of currencies. Prices for U.S. government debt rose. WEAK ORDERS Although motor vehicle production, machinery, and computer and electronic products increased last month, it was not enough to offset the drag on manufacturing output from declines in the production of electrical equipment, appliances and components, fabricated metal products and wood products.Manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy and more than 72 percent of industrial production, was also weighed down by falling output of nondurable goods such as food and petroleum products.It is likely to remain weak in the months ahead.In a separate report, the New York Fed said its Empire State general business conditions index dropped to a reading of minus 1.98 in June from 3.09 in May.That was the weakest reading since January 2013 and the second negative reading in the past three months. A gauge of new orders contracted, while shipments edged down. Though a measure of unfilled orders increased last month, it remained in contraction territory, indicating order books remained weak. ""Manufacturers will continue to struggle with the impact of the dollar's rise for some time yet,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto.But given manufacturing's small share of the economy and recent signs of a sharp pickup in growth in the non-factory sectors, Ashworth said ""there is every reason to believe that GDP growth will average between 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent annualized over the rest of this year.""That upbeat assessment was bolstered by a third report showing confidence among homebuilders vaulted to an eight-month high in June, suggesting the housing market recovery was gaining traction. Housing is expected to take up some of the slack from weak manufacturing.GDP contracted in the first quarter, slammed by bad weather, port disruptions, dollar strength and energy sector spending cuts.Last month, mining production fell 0.3 percent, the fifth straight monthly decline, as oil and gas well drilling and servicing fell 7.9 percent after plunging 14.5 percent in April.That took the cumulative drop since the end of 2014 to 51.8 percent. But the pace of decline in oil and gas well drilling and servicing is moderating, suggesting the worst of the spending cuts is over.Companies like Schlumberger, the world's No. 1 oilfield services provider, and Halliburton have slashed their capital spending budgets for this year.Oil and gas production, however, increased 0.5 percent in May. Unseasonably warm weather last month lifted demand for air conditioning, leading to a 0.2 percent increase in utilities production.The amount of industrial capacity in use last month fell to its lowest level since January 2014.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Paul Simao)",2015-06-15,PG,"Mon Jun 15, 2015 | 1:35pm EDT","WRAPUP 2-U.S. industrial output hurt by weakness in manufacturing, mining",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N0Z10NV20150615?type=companyNews,-0.19,0.098,0.801,0.101

Lew said failure to reach an agreement would create broad uncertainties for the global economy. ""The market seems to be pricing in a possibility, overpricing, a Greece exit,"" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York.He said he does not expect a surprise to the market from the Fed in terms of a rate hike, or from a Greek default.""Financials have been leading and dividend payers have sold off.

Stocks had opened lower but quickly turned higher and drifted up throughout the day to close near the session's high.Consumer staples lead the way up, with Coty shares at a record, closing up 19.3 percent at $31.08. Coty is on track to buy Procter & Gamble's beauty business in a $12 billion deal. P&G shares closed up 1.3 percent at $79.10.In other merger news, shares of NCR Corp hit a 14-month high of $36.50. Reuters reported Blackstone and Carlyle are making a joint bid for NCR in what would be the year's biggest leveraged buyout at more than $10 billion, including debt. NCR closed up 10.7 percent at $34.73 while Blackstone fell 0.6 percent to $41.98 and Carlyle rose 0.8 percent to $28.41. The chance that the Fed Wednesday will give more clarity on the timing of its expected rate hike was seen as a catalyst for more takeover deals.""Rising rates could be a trigger for even more M&A activity,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist at Wells Fargo Funds Management in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin.""They are a signal that now's the time to get the deals done if you are going to do them with cheap financing.""Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,946 to 1,104, for a 1.76-to-1 ratio on the upside; on the Nasdaq, 1,635 issues rose and 1,158 fell for a 1.41-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The benchmark S&P 500 index posted 8 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows while on the Nasdaq Composite there were 138 new highs and 37 new lows.About 5.5 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 5.98 billion daily average so far this month, according to BATS Global Markets.

304,"  (Refiles to fix typo in Procter in first paragraph)* Coty, P&G deal to take weeks to finalise - sources* JAB to own third of equity, 47-48 pct of voting rights* Deal would make Coty No. 1 perfume and hair care companyBy Astrid WendlandtPARIS, June 16 Coty is on track to acquire Procter & Gamble's  beauty business in a $12 billion deal that would make the U.S. cosmetic company the world leader in perfume and hair care, sources close to the matter said.If the deal goes though, Coty would get its hands on brands such as Gucci and Hugo Boss perfume, Wella and Clairol hair care products and Max Factor and Cover Girl make-up, part of its strategy to reverse its own declining sales trends.For P&G, the sale is part of a large plan to narrow its focus on fewer, faster-growing brands. The world's No. 1 household products maker said in August it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands over the next two years.Last year, it sold its Duracell batteries to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc for $4.7 billion and sold some of its soap brands to Unilever Plc. Coty was vying with Henkel for P&G's hair care businesses and won an auction over the weekend, the sources said, adding that details of the complex transaction are likely to take at least two weeks to be finalised.For tax purposes, the deal would be completed through a ""Reverse Morris Trust"", which means that P&G would spin off its beauty assets into a separate company that would then absorb Coty in an all-share deal, the sources said.Luxembourg-based JAB Holdings, the billionaire Reimann family's investment firm which controls 75 percent of Coty, would own about a third of the equity in the combined business and about 47-48 percent of voting rights, the sources said.P&G, Coty and JAB Holdings declined to comment. SHARES SURGE In New York trade, Coty shares closed 19.3 percent higher and have gained about 50 percent this year. P&G shares rose 1.3 percent.Wells Fargo analyst Chris Ferrara said a deal would be ""transformational"" for Coty and estimated it would increase its revenue to nearly $11 billion from $4.4 billion. ""A large deal would likely give Coty the opportunity to quickly exit 'tail' (poorly performing) brands and sustainably raise the company's growth profile,"" Ferrara said.In response to lower sales, Coty has been cutting costs and shedding staff. It has also been through much organisational change, merging divisions and replacing chief executives three times in the past three years.Elio Sceti, who ran Europe's largest frozen foods company Iglo Foods Holdings and has no experience in the cosmetics industry, will become Coty's chief executive next month.Coty, which makes Marc Jacobs, Calvin Klein, Chloe as well as celebrity perfumes, would become the world's No.1 perfume maker ahead of L'Oreal if the deal goes through, according to market research firm Euromonitor International.This would also mark its entry into the hair care market with the Wella and Clairol brands. In make-up, Coty, which has a significant presence in Britain and France, would gain a much bigger stronghold in the United States.JAB controls fashion brands Bally and Belstaff, shoe maker Jimmy Choo and coffee company D.E Master Blenders 1753, which is set to merge with the coffee business of Mondelez International. JAB's assets under management reached $39 billion this year, up from $14 billion in December 2011.(Editing by David Clarke)",2015-06-17,PG,"Wed Jun 17, 2015 | 7:00am EDT",REFILE-UPDATE 3-Coty on track to clinch P&G beauty deal in coming weeks-sources,http://www.reuters.com//article/procter-gamble-ma-coty-idUSL5N0Z22C920150617?type=companyNews,0.9932,0.017,0.878,0.105
305,"  (Corrects figures on Publicis contract wins, paragraph 13)* WPP's Sorrell says trading tough this year* Publicis' Levy say account reviews offer risk, opportunity* Ad market forecast to grow around 4.2 pct this yearBy Leila AbboudCANNES, June 26 The reluctance of big companies to spend at a time of lacklustre global growth and fewer major sporting events this year are dampening demand for advertising, said the chief executives of two leading ad agencies.In separate interviews on Friday, Martin Sorrell of WPP  and Maurice Levy of Publicis sounded cautious about the prospects for the advertising market, citing a lack of vibrancy in the U.S economy, weakness in Brazil, Russia and China, and Europe's continued fragility.""There is a lot of uncertainty,"" Levy told Reuters. ""Companies have cash to spend but are not in the mood to do so, and consumers are not feeling confident either.""Research firm Zenith Optimedia, owned by Publicis, recently cut its growth forecast for the global advertising market to 4.2 percent down from 4.9 percent earlier this year. For his part, Sorrell said that the major companies served by WPP agencies such as Ogilvy and Mather and Group M were very focused on cost controls, sometimes to the detriment of long-term investment in their brands and products.""Business is tough. Clients are very demanding in an environment where top-line growth is lower than it was before the financial crisis began,"" he said.UP FOR GRABS  Against that backdrop, the world's top six ad agencies face upheaval because an unprecedented $27 billion in media buying and planning contracts are up for review in the coming months at companies including Coca-Cola, Procter and Gamble  and L'Oreal.That is requiring them to defend some major contracts, while trying to steal others from rivals.Morgan Stanley estimated that Publicis was the most exposed, with 1.7 percent of sales at risk and 2.5 percent of earnings per share. It is defending seven contracts including P&G, General Mills, Twenty-First Century Fox and Coca-Cola.For WPP, about 1.1 percent of revenue and 1.6 percent of earnings per share are risk as it seeks to keep nine contracts including Volkswagen and Unilever. Both Sorrell and Levy claimed the reviews were an opportunity to win business, while acknowledging that the fees would be lower on the new deals than the old ones.""The reviews are worrying for the agencies but their effects will also be felt on media owners because the price of ads will fall further,"" Levy predicted, referring to TV broadcasters, print outlets, and radio.Levy said Publicis had already won one contract with beauty products maker Coty with billings of $100 million and another with coffee specialist Keurig worth $150 million.""If we lose all our current contracts and win none of the new ones we're going for then our sales could drop 2 percent,"" said Levy.""But if we defend everything and win all the new ones, then they could go up as much as 3 percent.""Sorrell said that WPP's plan was to stress its technology and data expertise in pitches to clients. WPP has made a big bet on data with its Kantar unit, which Sorrell argues offers a competitive advantage although a lower margin business.""We are differentiated from our competitors and that will help in the reviews,"" he said.

307,"   By Astrid Wendlandt and Siddharth Cavale  Coty Inc (COTY.N), the U.S. maker of Calvin Klein and Chloe perfume, will buy Procter & Gamble's (PG.N) perfume, hair care and make-up businesses for $12.5 billion in the biggest cosmetics merger in recent history.Coty would become the No. 1 perfume maker ahead of L'Oreal (OREP.PA) and No. 3 make-up provider behind its French rival and Estee Lauder (EL.N). It would run the perfume licenses of Gucci, Hugo Boss and Dolce & Gabbana as well as make-up brands Cover Girl and Max Factor, more than doubling its size with combined sales of more than $10 billion.The deal comes as Coty's sales across categories have either been stagnating or declining for more than two years while P&G has been struggling to expand its beauty business.Coty shares fell 4.6 percent, while P&G slipped 0.4 percent as investors questioned the benefits of the mega-merger. ""We are getting critical mass around the globe with access to key markets such as Brazil, Japan and Mexico,"" Coty Chairman and Chief Executive Bart Becht said in an interview on Thursday.Analysts said the mass beauty brands Coty is set to acquire is expected to do well in emerging markets due to low pricing but the company has to invest in new initiatives to revive growth in developed markets.""The deal is extremely transformative for Coty, but investors are uncertain of what this means for the company,"" retail research firm Conlumino's Chief Executive Neil Saunders said. The debt Coty will assume, fairly small savings and questions on how it will cope with the transition make investors nervous, he said.Coty said the deal would save $550 million, including $400 million in non-transferred overhead costs, but take on $2.9 billion of P&G Beauty' debt.But Coty's stock is still up about 17 percent from before Reuters' June 8 report that it was fighting rivals such as Henkel for P&G's beauty business and had submitted a bid for the P&G assets. The sale is part of P&G's plan to narrow its focus on fewer, faster-growing brands. The world's No. 1 household products maker said last year it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands.The 43 brands being sold generated sales of $5.9 billion, or 7 percent of P&G's total revenue in fiscal 2013/14, and adjusted income of $1.15 billion.By taking on P&G's hair brands Wella and Clairol, Coty is entering a whole new business, which ranked No. 2 in terms of market share.On a call with analysts, P&G said it prefers to execute the deal through a ""Reverse Morris Trust"" split off transaction in which its shareholders could exchange P&G shares for those of Coty and the new beauty businesses.However, if it is executed as a split-merge, P&G would establish a separate entity to hold these beauty brands which would be transferred to electing P&G shareholders in a tax efficient transaction. There will also be a simultaneous merger of the new entity with Coty. P&G said it expects to close the deal in the second half of calendar 2016 pending regulatory approvals.P&G shareholders would own 52 percent of the combined business while Coty's existing shareholders will own 48 percent.Coty shareholder JAB Holdings, the Luxemburg investment company of the billionaire German Reimann family, will own a third of the combined entity.

315,"  (Adds details, updates shares)By Siddharth CavaleJuly 9 Coty Inc has sealed a deal to buy Procter & Gamble Co's beauty business, which includes brands such as Clairol and Wella, in a $12.5 billion transaction that will make Coty the world leader in perfume and hair care.Coty's shares fell 6 percent in early trading after the widely expected deal, while P&G was up 0.6 percent.In a tax-efficient deal designed as a ""Reverse Morris Trust"" transaction, P&G will separate 43 of its cosmetics, fragrance and haircare brands and fold them into Coty.The deal is a game-changer for Coty as it adds popular brands such as Wella and Clairol hair color products and Cover Girl and Max Factor make-up to its portfolio of perfume brands that include Marc Jacobs and Calvin Klein. Coty will also gain access to Gucci and Dolce & Gabbana perfumes as part of the deal.For P&G, the sale is part of a plan to narrow its focus on fewer, faster-growing brands. The world's No. 1 household products maker said last year it could sell about half of its slow-growing brands.The combined company is expected to have annual revenue of more than $10 billion - double Coty's turnover - and will be led by Coty CEO Bart Becht. Coty, which is trying to staunch a decline in sales, said it expects hair color products to account for 24 percent of total sales after the deal is completed.Coty said it expects to generate about $4.5 billion in annual sales from its fragrance business, making it the world's largest fragrance company by sales.It also expects to become the third largest brand in the color and cosmetics sector, behind L'Oreal and Estee Lauder. JAB Cosmetics B.V. owns 97 percent of Coty's Class B shares is in favor of the deal, Coty said. JAB is controlled by Germany's billionaire Reimann family.Coty said the deal valued the P&G Beauty Business at $12.5 billion at the time of the proposal. Based on Coty's current stock price, outstanding shares and equity grants, the value of the transaction is about $15 billion, P&G said.P&G estimated a one-time gain of $5 billion-$7 billion,  depending on the final deal value at the time of closing.Reuters first reported in June that Coty was on track to acquire P&G's brands in a $12 billion deal.Goldman Sachs advised P&G, while Morgan Stanley was the lead adviser for Coty.

317,"   By Astrid Wendlandt | PARIS  PARIS Coty Inc's boss Bart Becht believes he is the right man to run what will become the world's biggest perfume maker, despite industry doubts over its planned mega-merger and faltering sales at the beauty products group.With Coty due to gobble up Procter & Gamble's beauty business for $12.5 billion, Becht has no intention of seeking anyone else to lead the expanded group where he is both chairman and chief executive following a series of high-level departures.""As you know, there has been a lot of changes at Coty over the past 12 to 18 months ... so the board asked me to stay to oversee the transaction,"" Becht told Reuters after the P&G deal was announced last week. The 58-year-old Dutchman said it was possible the group, founded in Paris and New York-based, could hire a new leader in the future but there was no time frame for that now.Becht, who jointly runs a Luxembourg holding company that is Coty's biggest shareholder, knows how to merge big businesses. He tied up Dutch-based Benckiser with Britain's Reckitt & Colman in 1999 and ran the combined chemicals and consumer goods group for more than a decade.Under him, Reckitt Benckiser grew in value from 3 billion to 23.5 billion pounds, helped by two major acquisitions. Its shares rose more than four-fold over a decade.Coty, the maker of Calvin Klein and Chloe perfumes, has at times proved a tougher proposition since Becht became chairman in 2011 to prepare for a stock market flotation. After its New York debut in 2013, the share price stagnated and at times was significantly lower until late autumn last year.Still, Becht's cuts to marketing departments and expenses in general lifted profits, and the stock eventually responded. It rose more than 60 percent in the eight months to June, when news broke that the P&G deal was afoot.But since peaking at $32 in early July just before the merger was officially announced, it has lost 15 percent as the forecast earnings boost was smaller than expected and investors were concerned the deal would take more than a year to complete.NUMBERS MAN While Becht is known in the industry for his cost-cutting abilities, he has a stronger record in managing fast-moving consumer goods such as Woolite soap than high-end perfumes.""Becht is a numbers man, an efficient operator and a great deal-maker but he is not a person with a particularly strong luxury sensitivity,"" said one former senior Coty manager who worked with him for several years.Under Becht, who is personally Coty's seventh biggest shareholder, the group has become one of the industry's worst performers in terms of sales. These fell 2.1 percent in the year to June 30, 2014 while Estee Lauder's revenue grew 8 percent in the same period and L'Oreal's like-for-like sales rose 3.7 percent in calendar 2014.Becht has also made pay-offs to three chief executives - two who departed and one who never arrived. A week before frozen foods manager Elio Leoni Sceti was due to start on July 1, Becht told him not to come, allowing the Dutchman to handle the merger in both top jobs. Sceti got $1.75 million in compensation. Coty, which was once associated with the early 20th century inventor of modern perfumery Francois Coty, highlights the dangers of putting profits before creativity and innovation - a recipe for disaster in terms of sales growth.Some analysts say the future looks difficult. ""Valuation could decline if Coty does not improve organic sales growth in the base business ... and CEO Bart Becht did not offer solid arguments why, and in what timeframe, this deal would enhance organic sales growth,"" said Linda Bolton Weiser at broker B. Riley & Co. Weiser, who kept a ""sell"" rating on Coty stock, cited uncertainty over how long Becht would stay and whether the company could eventually find a super-star to manage this ""beauty beast"" - the P&G deal will double Coty's size, creating a group with more than $10 billion in annual sales. Coty, which makes Rimmel mascara, will run P&G's make-up brands Cover Girl and Max Factor as well as its perfume licenses with fashion brands Gucci, Hugo Boss and Dolce & Gabbana. It will also enter a new category with P&G's Wella and Clairol hair treatment brands.NO GROWTH Many of Coty's big perfume brands such as Calvin Klein have lost market share and quarterly revenue has either fallen or stagnated for more than two years.P&G's beauty businesses have performed little better. This year, sales of its fragrance brands are down and make-up brands flat, while its hair business is modestly growing, sources close to the deal said. Coty and P&G declined to confirm the trends. Becht said the merger would not create growth overnight but would generate $550 million in savings and boost future profits and earnings per share - on which his long-term incentive plan is based.After waves of job losses, Coty employees fear further cuts once the deal goes through, according to people at the company. Restructuring has created a climate of fear ""which is not very good for creativity"", said one person still at Coty.This worries analysts.

For example, Henri Coty, grandson of the company's founder, failed to persuade Coty to re-launch historic perfumes such as L'Origan.Francois Coty, a descendant of Napoleon, was one of France's richest men who owned Figaro newspaper and made his fortune in building fragrance factories, flower fields and collaborating with crystal bottle makers such as Baccarat and glass designer Rene Lalique.

JAB has a checkered history with creative types. Shortly after it bought Jimmy Choo in 2011, it parted ways with Tamara Mellon, who was the soul of its fashion success. Several of JAB's luxury brands are struggling. British jacket brand Belstaff has not stopped haemorrhaging cash since JAB bought the firm in 2011.

318,"  * Coty to swallow up P&G beauty business for $12.5 bln* Becht has good record on big mergers, cost-cutting* But Coty sales falter under his leadership* Ex-manager questions Becht's feel for luxury market* Becht hasn't explained how sales will grow -analystBy Astrid WendlandtPARIS, July 16 Coty Inc's boss Bart Becht believes he is the right man to run what will become the world's biggest perfume maker, despite industry doubts over its planned mega-merger and faltering sales at the beauty products group.With Coty due to gobble up Procter & Gamble's beauty business for $12.5 billion, Becht has no intention of seeking anyone else to lead the expanded group where he is both chairman and chief executive following a series of high-level departures.""As you know, there has been a lot of changes at Coty over the past 12 to 18 months ... so the board asked me to stay to oversee the transaction,"" Becht told Reuters after the P&G deal was announced last week.The 58-year-old Dutchman said it was possible the group, founded in Paris and New York-based, could hire a new leader in the future but there was no time frame for that now.Becht, who jointly runs a Luxembourg holding company that is Coty's biggest shareholder, knows how to merge big businesses. He tied up Dutch-based Benckiser with Britain's Reckitt & Colman in 1999 and ran the combined chemicals and consumer goods group for more than a decade.Under him, Reckitt Benckiser grew in value from 3 billion to 23.5 billion pounds, helped by two major acquisitions. Its shares rose more than four-fold over a decade.Coty, the maker of Calvin Klein and Chloe perfumes, has at times proved a tougher proposition since Becht became chairman in 2011 to prepare for a stock market flotation. After its New York debut in 2013, the share price stagnated and at times was significantly lower until late autumn last year.Still, Becht's cuts to marketing departments and expenses in general lifted profits, and the stock eventually responded. It rose more than 60 percent in the eight months to June, when news broke that the P&G deal was afoot.But since peaking at $32 in early July just before the merger was officially announced, it has lost 15 percent as the forecast earnings boost was smaller than expected and investors were concerned the deal would take more than a year to complete. NUMBERS MAN While Becht is known in the industry for his cost-cutting abilities, he has a stronger record in managing fast-moving consumer goods such as Woolite soap than high-end perfumes.""Becht is a numbers man, an efficient operator and a great deal-maker but he is not a person with a particularly strong luxury sensitivity,"" said one former senior Coty manager who worked with him for several years.Under Becht, who is personally Coty's seventh biggest shareholder, the group has become one of the industry's worst performers in terms of sales. These fell 2.1 percent in the year to June 30, 2014 while Estee Lauder's revenue grew 8 percent in the same period and L'Oreal's like-for-like sales rose 3.7 percent in calendar 2014.Becht has also made pay-offs to three chief executives - two who departed and one who never arrived. A week before frozen foods manager Elio Leoni Sceti was due to start on July 1, Becht told him not to come, allowing the Dutchman to handle the merger in both top jobs. Sceti got $1.75 million in compensation.Coty, which was once associated with the early 20th century inventor of modern perfumery Francois Coty, highlights the dangers of putting profits before creativity and innovation - a recipe for disaster in terms of sales growth.Some analysts say the future looks difficult. ""Valuation could decline if Coty does not improve organic sales growth in the base business ... and CEO Bart Becht did not offer solid arguments why, and in what timeframe, this deal would enhance organic sales growth,"" said Linda Bolton Weiser at broker B. Riley & Co.Weiser, who kept a ""sell"" rating on Coty stock, cited uncertainty over how long Becht would stay and whether the company could eventually find a super-star to manage this ""beauty beast"" - the P&G deal will double Coty's size, creating a group with more than $10 billion in annual sales. Coty, which makes Rimmel mascara, will run P&G's make-up brands Cover Girl and Max Factor as well as its perfume licences with fashion brands Gucci, Hugo Boss and Dolce & Gabbana. It will also enter a new category with P&G's Wella and Clairol hair treatment brands.NO GROWTH Many of Coty's big perfume brands such as Calvin Klein have lost market share and quarterly revenue has either fallen or stagnated for more than two years.P&G's beauty businesses have performed little better. This year, sales of its fragrance brands are down and make-up brands flat, while its hair business is modestly growing, sources close to the deal said. Coty and P&G declined to confirm the trends.Becht said the merger would not create growth overnight but would generate $550 million in savings and boost future profits and earnings per share - on which his long-term incentive plan is based.After waves of job losses, Coty employees fear further cuts once the deal goes through, according to people at the company. Restructuring has created a climate of fear ""which is not very good for creativity"", said one person still at Coty.This worries analysts. ""One of my concerns is how Coty will retain and attract talent,"" said Mark Astrachan, analyst at broker Stifel.Bernd Beetz, who led Coty for 11 years, departed as CEO less than a year after Becht arrived. Beetz was known for empowering staff, making them take risks and come up with innovative marketing campaigns and products, former and current Coty managers said, declining to be named.

325,"   By Tim McLaughlin and Dena Aubin | BOSTON  BOSTON Venezuela's currency woes cut nearly $3 billion in profit at U.S. blue-chip companies during the second quarter and prompted Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) to remove its operations in the South American country from its consolidated financial reports.More so-called deconsolidation moves and exits from Venezuela are likely to happen during the second half of the year as U.S. corporations grow increasingly frustrated with Venezuela's sinking Bolivar currency, according to analysts and U.S. regulatory filings.Deconsolidating Venezuelan operations means that business can largely no longer hurt or benefit a U.S. parent company's financial results. Often companies are taking a big one-time charge so that they can ring-fence what is left in Venezuela.Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) and Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co (GT.O), for example, said they also may deconsolidate their Venezuela operations if economic conditions in that country worsen, according to U.S. regulatory filings made this week.And Mattel Inc (MAT.O) said it may cease operations in Venezuela altogether if volatility in Venezuela worsens. With slumping crude oil prices and debt payments coming due this year, the Venezuelan government has fewer U.S. dollar reserves available to meet the private sector’s demands. As a result, entities may have a harder time obtaining U.S. dollars than any time since currency controls were first implemented in 2003, Ernst & Young said in an April report.  Jack Ciesielski, president of investment research firm R.G. Associates, said if conditions do not improve in Venezuela, he expects to see more companies follow P&G’s lead. “I’d say the die has been cast,” he said. Drug maker Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) took a $715 million second-quarter hit against profit after it revalued its Venezuela assets using a less preferential exchange rate. But the biggest impact from Venezuela's currency woes came from Procter & Gamble. The world's largest consumer products maker on Thursday announced a $2.1 billion charge against earnings, reflecting the company's inability to convert Venezuela's currency or pay dividends.   Beginning in the third quarter, P&G will exclude the operating results of its Venezuelan subsidiaries from its consolidated financial statements.Hits to U.S. corporate profits in Venezuela accelerated in February when the President Nicolas Maduro devalued the bolivar by 70 percent via a new currency system known as Simadi. Previously, many U.S. companies valued their monetary and non-monetary assets at the most preferred rate of 6.3 bolivars to the dollar.

P&G has dropped about 50 brands since 2014, of which 43 were sold to perfume maker Coty Inc for $12.5 billion this month.P&G intends to retain a core portfolio of 65 brands, including Tide detergent, Pampers diapers and Gillette shaving products.Neil Saunders, CEO of research firm Conlumino, said P&G needs to get rid of more brands if it wants to turn itself around faster.Net income attributable to P&G fell 80 percent to $521 million, or 18 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended June 30, mainly due to a $2.03 billion one-time charge related to its Venezuelan operations.Revenue fell 9.2 percent to $17.79 billion.(Additional reporting by Ramkumar Iyer; Editing by Simon Jennings and Kirti Pandey)",2015-07-30,PG,"Thu Jul 30, 2015 | 2:56pm EDT",UPDATE 3-P&G results raise concerns about pace of turnaround,http://www.reuters.com//article/procter-gamble-results-idUSL3N10A4KS20150730?type=companyNews,0.9497,0.035,0.89,0.075

335,"  (Updates with economists raising Q2 growth estimates)* Factory orders increase 1.8 percent in June* Gain in core capital goods orders lowered to 0.7 percent* Shipments of core capital goods revised to show increaseBy Lucia MutikaniWASHINGTON, Aug 4 New orders for U.S. factory goods rebounded strongly in June on robust demand for transportation equipment and other goods, a hopeful sign for the struggling manufacturing sector.The Commerce Department said on Tuesday new orders for manufactured goods increased 1.8 percent after declining 1.1 percent in May.""We are moving past the very weak period for the manufacturing sector from early on this year, but that activity has yet to meaningfully increase,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.Factory activity has been stymied by a strong dollar and spending cuts in the energy sector after last year's sharp plunge in crude oil prices. Tepid global demand also has weighed on manufacturing, which accounts for about 12 percent of the domestic economy. Those factors have eroded the profits of multinational companies like Caterpillar Inc, Procter & Gamble Co , the world's largest household products maker, and Whirlpool Corp, the global home appliances giant.Though there are signs that the energy spending drag is easing, the dollar's strength will likely remain a constraint. The dollar has gained 15 percent against the currencies of the United States' main trading partners since June 2014.Stocks on Wall Street were little changed, while prices for U.S. government debt fell. The dollar was largely flat against a basket of currencies.Orders for transportation equipment surged 9.3 percent in June, reflecting a 65.4 percent jump in aircraft bookings. There were increases in orders for machinery, furniture, fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, appliances and components.SOLID INVENTORIES The Commerce Department also said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - seen as a measure of business confidence and spending plans - increased 0.7 percent instead of the 0.9 percent rise reported last month. Shipments of these so-called core capital goods, which are used to calculate business equipment spending in the gross domestic product report, increased 0.3 percent in June. Shipments were previously reported to have dipped 0.1 percent.Manufacturing inventories increased a solid 0.6 percent, which was more than the government assumed in its second-quarter GDP snapshot published last week.Coming on the heels of a report on Monday showing stronger construction spending in May and April than previously reported, economists said the sturdy increase in factory inventories suggested that second-quarter GDP could be revised to as high as a 3 percent annual pace.The Commerce Department reported last Thursday that the economy expanded at a 2.3 percent pace in the second quarter. It will publish its second GDP estimate for that quarter later this month.In the wake of the construction data, economists had said they expected second-quarter growth would be raised by at least four-tenths of a percentage point to a 2.7 percent pace. They forecast factory inventories adding another 0.3 percentage point.But with the inventories-to-shipments ratio at a lofty 1.35, compared to 1.30 last September, manufacturers might be sitting on a pile of unwanted goods, which could hurt production and weigh on growth in the coming quarters.""It also highlights the probability that an unwinding of this stockpiling will almost assuredly result in a drag on GDP growth in the second half of the year,"" Tim Quinlin, an economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.

336,"  (Adds comments, details on valuation, updates share prices)By Jonathan Stempel, Sagarika Jaisinghani and Sweta SinghAug 10 Warren Buffett is paying a hefty price for the biggest bet of his career as his Berkshire Hathaway Inc  has agreed to buy Precision Castparts Corp, valuing the maker of aerospace and other parts at $32.3 billion.The purchase is Berkshire's largest, and accelerates its transformation from a company largely dependent on insurance businesses into one resembling the broader U.S. economy, including a railroad, several industrial companies, utilities, a car dealership and consumer goods businesses.It also joins several recent Buffett forays into unglamorous sectors, including a big stake Kraft Heinz Co and the pending takeover of the Duracell battery business from Procter & Gamble Co.Berkshire has said it owned 3 percent of Precision Castparts prior to Monday's takeover. Precision Castparts earned $1.53 billion in its latest fiscal year.""I'm not crazy about paying $30 billion for a $1.5 billion earnings stream of a cyclical company supplying airplane makers,"" said Jeff Matthews, a principal at hedge fund Ram Partners and author of a book about Buffett. ""I'd keep the $30 billion and wait for the next crisis.""Known for buying undervalued and often unloved companies, Buffett acknowledged paying a steep price for Precision Castparts, which has been hurt by falling oil and gas prices.""This is a very high multiple for us to pay,"" he told CNBC television.Berkshire is paying $235 per share for Precision Castparts, which represents a 21.2 percent premium over Friday's closing price, and 17.5 times projected 12-month profit. It valued Precision Castparts at $37.2 billion including debt.The merger eclipses Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's $26.5 billion purchase in 2010 of the 77.4 percent of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad that it did not already own.In afternoon trading, Precision Castparts shares rose $37.13, or 19.2 percent, to $231.01. Berkshire's Class A shares fell $522.76, or 0.2 percent, to $214,940. 'CREDIT TO TODD COMBS' The latest purchase shows how hard it is to move the needle at Berkshire, whose own stock has lagged the Standard & Poor's 500 in the last five years and which on Friday posted quarterly operating profit well below analyst forecasts.Adding Precision Castparts would boost Berkshire's overall operating profit by less than 10 percent.It would also give Berkshire ownership of 10 companies that standing alone could be part of the Fortune 500, plus 26.9 percent of Kraft Heinz.Todd Combs, one of Buffett's investment managers, had begun buying Precision Castparts shares in 2012. ""You've got to give credit to Todd Combs for this deal,"" said Buffett, who turns 85 on August 30. Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965.Precision Castparts generates 70 percent of sales by making nuts, bolts and other fittings for the aerospace industry, where booming commercial aircraft demand has led Airbus Group SE  and Boeing Co to boost production.But the Portland, Oregon-based company also makes parts for the energy industry, which has struggled as oil prices   have fallen by more than half over the last year.Prior to Monday, Precision Castparts' shares had fallen 20 percent in 2015, and the purchase price is below the shares' 52-week high of $249.05 set last September.Even so, analysts said Berkshire is paying more than 12 times trailing earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

337,"  (Adds details, Rospotrebnadzor and P&G responses)By Maria KiselyovaAug 25 Russia's consumer safety watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said it had asked retailers to withdraw some batches of detergents made by foreign companies including Henkel & Co and Procter & Gamble as they did not meet toxicological safety criteria.German retailer Metro AG said on Tuesday that its cash-and-carry stores in Russia had removed some cleaning and cosmetic products from their shelves on Rospotrebnadzor's orders.Russia banned many food imports from the European Union and the United States last year in retaliation to their sanctions over Moscow's role in the Ukraine conflict. Russia expanded the list of countries this year and restricted flower imports from the Netherlands, citing health risks.The extent of the withdrawal of foreign detergents, including those made by Colgate-Palmolive and Clorox Co , was not immediately clear. Russian media said only some products were affected rather than entire product lines.Rospotrebnadzor said on Tuesday that it was conducting tests on household chemicals and detergents made by other companies, but it did not elaborate. The watchdog is carrying out an unscheduled inspection of Henkel's plant in Russia after reaching an agreement with the prosecutor general's office, an official at Rospotrebnadzor's Perm branch told Reuters. The results are expected in four days at the earliest, the official said.Henkel's spokeswoman Natalia Ovakimian said the company was aware of the inspections, which were linked to the regulator's earlier order to withdraw some of its detergent products from retail chains. Clorox spokeswoman Aileen Zerrudo said the company did not ""actively market cleaning products in Russia,"" but might have sold a ""small amount of products"" to a distributor.""In countries where we don't operate but have permitted distribution of our products, we work with distributors to ensure regulations are met,"" she said, adding that Clorox would conduct a ""thorough assessment of this matter.""P&G said it was seeking to work with the Rospotrebnadzor to resolve the matter as soon as possible.Russia's home care market is valued at 188.54 billion rubles ($2.74 billion), according to Euromonitor. P&G has a 27.4 percent share of the market, with Henkel holding 16.3 percent.

The Fed has achieved the employment part of its dual mandate and this is what triggered the rates liftoff yesterday,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 271,000 for the week ended Dec. 12, the Labor Department said on Thursday.It was the 41st straight week that claims remained below 300,000, a threshold associated with strong labor market conditions. That is the longest such run since the early 1970s. The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it strips out week-to-week volatility, slipped 250 to 270,500 last week.The Fed said in its policy statement on Wednesday that there had been ""further improvement"" in the labor market and that ""underutilization of labor resources"" had diminished appreciably since the beginning of the year.Despite the labor market momentum, there remains no respite for the manufacturing sector, which has been slammed by a robust dollar, deep spending cuts by energy firms, weak global demand and efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory glut.A separate report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed its gauge of manufacturing activity in the region fell to -5.9 this month from 1.9 in November. It was the third negative reading in the past four months.Factories in the mid-Atlantic region reported that new orders continued to decline this month, though there was an increase in shipments. Order books shrunk, while inventories  increased for the first time in four months. ""The intense headwinds facing the U.S. manufacturing sector  continue to linger,"" said Millan Mulraine, deputy chief economist at TD Securities in New York.A survey early this month showed manufacturing, which accounts for 12 percent of the U.S. economy, contracted in November for the first time in three years. The weak Philadelphia Fed survey brought it in line with other regional surveys that have been mired in contractionary territory.U.S. stocks fell, while the dollar jumped to a fresh two-week high against a basket of currencies. U.S. government debt prices rose. JOBS MARKET STRENGTH The claims data covered the survey period for December nonfarm payrolls.

Payrolls increased by 211,000 in November.""We expect a 200,000 December nonfarm payroll increase, with limited upside risk from a tight claims path,"" said Michael Englund, chief economist at Action Economics in Boulder, Colorado.Dollar strength, which has eroded exports and the profits of multinational corporations, helped to push the current account deficit in the third quarter to its highest level in nearly seven years, another report from the Commerce Department showed.The current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, increased 11.7 percent to $124.1 billion, the largest shortfall since the fourth quarter of 2008.The current account was also pressured by an increase in remittances, government grants and pensions, and dividend payments to foreign individuals and entities.The deficit represented 2.7 percent of gross domestic product, the biggest share since the second quarter of 2012, up from 2.5 percent in the second quarter. The current account shortfall, however, is not a problem as the United States continues to attract ample income from overseas.""With rates of return in foreign economies likely to remain depressed for the foreseeable future, we look for the dollar to strengthen further in the coming quarters,"" said Jay Bryson, global economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina.(Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Paul Simao)",2015-12-17,PG,"Thu Dec 17, 2015 | 11:40am EST","WRAPUP 2-U.S. labor market strengthening, factories struggling",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-economy-idUSL1N1460ZV20151217?type=companyNews,0.9857,0.064,0.823,0.113

351,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON A slew of major  U.S. corporations are likely to announce in the next few weeks whether they will take big writedowns for their troubled Venezuela operations, and some may say they are leaving the country altogether. The companies may decide to slash the valuations of their businesses and take charges based on declines in some of the  oil producing nation’s four exchange rates for the bolivar currency, of which three are official and one black market, and then deconsolidate the operations on their balance sheets, Wall Street securities analysts said.They may have more reason to accelerate the process after the socialist government on Friday declared a 60-day economic emergency, which would give President Nicolas Maduro wider powers to intervene in companies or limit access to already scarce dollars in Venezuela.It also disclosed that the nation’s economy contracted by 4.5 percent in the first nine months of last year while the official annual inflation rate was the world’s highest at 141.5 percent in that period, as plunging oil prices, and what critics of Maduro see as policy missteps, took an increasing toll.    Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.    The Reuters analysis shows that U.S. companies with exposure could face total writedowns of more than $3 billion if they revalue their assets in Venezuela using the less preferential Simadi exchange rate of nearly 200 bolivars to the dollar. In the past, many companies valued their assets using the main official rate of 6.3 bolivars per dollar.     But even that change may not reveal the full extent of the problem given that the black market exchange rate has worsened to about 878 bolivars to the dollar from about 190 bolivars a year ago, according to dolartoday.com, a website that tracks the rate.        MONITORING DAY-BY-DAY     Increased government regulations and lack of access to U.S. dollars at lower rates could force companies such as Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co to deconsolidate if they lose further control over their operations. Goodyear said in recent financial disclosures that a deconsolidation move would trigger a one-time, pre-tax charge of more than $500 million and what it termed “derecognition” of $293 million of cash on its balance sheet. Goodyear was not immediately available for comment. At a Jan. 12 investor conference, Goodyear Chief Financial Officer Laura Thompson described Venezuela as “a very volatile environment.”“The outlook is pretty uncertain. Our visibility is unclear, but we continue to monitor the situation day-by-day, quarter-by-quarter, as we go,” Thompson said.Deconsolidation under U.S. accounting rules allow companies to treat a subsidiary in a volatile foreign market as an investment rather than an operating unit, while writing down the market value of that subsidiary largely insulates the parent company from future hits to its financial results.So far, blue-chip companies that have deconsolidated in Venezuela and written off nearly all of their investment there include Procter & Gamble Co, Pepsico Inc and Ford Motor Co. Among those who have departed altogether is cleaning products maker Clorox Co.One major pressure point could be drug companies.

352,"   By Tim McLaughlin | BOSTON  BOSTON A slew of major  U.S. corporations are likely to announce in the next few weeks whether they will take big writedowns for their troubled Venezuela operations, and some may say they are leaving the country altogether. The companies may decide to slash the valuations of their businesses and take charges based on declines in some of the  oil producing nation’s four exchange rates for the bolivar currency, of which three are official and one black market, and then deconsolidate the operations on their balance sheets, Wall Street securities analysts said.They may have more reason to accelerate the process after the socialist government on Friday declared a 60-day economic emergency, which would give President Nicolas Maduro wider powers to intervene in companies or limit access to already scarce dollars in Venezuela.It also disclosed that the nation’s economy contracted by 4.5 percent in the first nine months of last year while the official annual inflation rate was the world’s highest at 141.5 percent in that period, as plunging oil prices, and what critics of Maduro see as policy missteps, took an increasing toll.    Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.

The price hikes helped it boost organic sales in the latest quarter, but led to a drop in volumes across all businesses.P&G also posted a better-than-expected profit by cutting costs, sending its shares up 2.5 percent to $78.79 on Tuesday, outperforming the broader consumer staples index .SPLRCS.""Today's results, along with increased visibility of the new CEO David Taylor, could move the stock into the $80s in the coming months,"" SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst William Chappell wrote in a note titled, 'Two percent organic growth a ""nice start"" for new CEO'.

P&G now expects to reduce non-manufacturing costs by 25-30 percent by 2016, a year ahead of schedule, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a conference call.Moeller said P&G would continue investing despite the strong dollar and expects media spend to increase in double-digits in the second half of 2016.The company, which gets nearly two-thirds of sales from outside North America, also said it would reduce its focus on unprofitable brands in India in favor of higher-margin products. P&G said the strong dollar reduced second-quarter sales by 9 percent and in 2016 expects it to reduce sales by 7 percentage points, more than the 5-6 percentage points it estimated earlier.Overall, full-year sales are still expected to decline in the high-single digits.P&G's second-quarter sales fell 8.5 percent to $16.92 billion, slightly below analysts average estimate.

Crude prices soared 6 percent on hopes that OPEC and non-OPEC producers would tackle an unrelenting supply glut.Investors are still reeling from a turbulent start to 2016, which saw Wall Street post its worst-ever start to a year, and a two-day recovery late last week was largely wiped out on Monday.""I think the market is just oversold on a near-term basis,"" said Jeffrey Saut, chief investment strategist at Raymond James Financial in Florida.""We're getting a rally here and it's not because of any particular event,"" he said, adding that traders were likely taking up positions ahead of Apple's earnings report. Shares of Apple, which is scheduled to report results after the close, were up 1 percent at $100.42. The iPhone maker's comments on its China business will be in sharp focus, amid broader concerns of a slowdown in demand.At 12:35 p.m. ET (1735 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average was up 292.7 points, or 1.84 percent, at 16,177.92, the S&P 500 was up 28.6 points, or 1.52 percent, at 1,905.68 and the Nasdaq Composite index was up 57.10 points, or 1.26 percent, at 4,575.59.While the U.S. Federal Reserve is not expected to move on interest rates at its two-day meeting, which begins on Tuesday, investors will parse the commentary to gauge the impact of the recent global turmoil on the central bank's outlook.Exxon was the biggest influence on the S&P 500, rising 3.3 percent, while Chevron rose 4.1 percent. 3M was up 4.4 percent at $143.69, giving the biggest boost to the Dow, after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit.Johnson & Johnson was up 3.5 percent at $99.74, while Procter & Gamble rose 2.3 percent to $78.64. Both companies reported profits that beat estimates.Coach jumped 11.3 percent to $33.79 after it reported its first increase in sales in 10 quarters.However, expectations of profit growth for the quarter are weak, with earnings at S&P 500 companies on average expected to fall 4.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 2,600 to 428. On the Nasdaq, 2,030 issues rose and 671 fell.The S&P 500 index showed three new 52-week highs and seven new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded five new highs and 60 lows.(Reporting by Abhiram Nandakumar in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D'Silva)",2016-01-26,PG,"Tue Jan 26, 2016 | 12:52pm EST","US STOCKS-Strong earnings, oil recovery drive indexes higher",http://www.reuters.com//article/usa-stocks-idUSL3N15A4X3?type=companyNews,0.836,0.037,0.903,0.059

It would run the perfume licenses of Gucci and Hugo Boss as well as make-up brands such as Max Factor, more than doubling its size with combined sales of more than $10 billion.

376,"   By Daniel Wiessner  A former cosmetics saleswoman for Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) is suing the company, claiming that she was fired after becoming  pregnant and being told earlier by a supervisor that ""pregnancy is not part of the uniform.""The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Manhattan on Friday by Tiffany Kantrowitz, who for two years worked at P&G’s Dolce and Gabbana makeup shop inside Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. P&G has a licensing agreement to make and sell Dolce and Gabbana products, according to a company representative who declined to comment on the lawsuit. Neither Dolce and Gabbana nor Saks was named in the lawsuit. Kantrowitz says she was fired by P&G in February 2015 after asking to be allowed to sit down while dealing with customers because she was pregnant, in violation of the federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act and a similar New York City law. Instead of accommodating Kantrowitz's request, the lawsuit said, P&G forced her to take breaks that were deducted from the leave time she was entitled to under the Family and Medical Leave Act. She says she planned to take leave only after her baby was born. ""For (P&G), ever vigilant about the image of its makeup shop sales associates, pregnancy did not comport with the 'perfect look,'"" the lawsuit said.Before she became pregnant, the suit said, Kantrowitz told a supervisor she wanted children and he responded that ""pregnancy is not part of the uniform."" When Kantrowitz was fired, the company told her it was because she had taken ""tester"" items for personal use, according to the lawsuit. But P&G encouraged its cosmetics staff to do so, the suit says, and never warned Kantrowitz against it during her time with the company. Pregnancy discrimination has been a top issue for groups that focus on employment protections for women, along with pay parity and wage increases in industries that employ disproportionate numbers of women. The issue received national attention last year, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N)  improperly denied a pregnant driver's request not to lift heavy packages. The court, in a 6-3 decision, said employers must offer legitimate business reasons to deny accommodations to pregnant employees, and cannot simply claim it would be expensive or inconvenient.The case is Kantrowitz v.

378,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan  Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette shaving products, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, boosted by cost-cutting and higher selling prices.However, P&G's sales declined for the seventh quarter in a row as higher prices weighed on volumes and as the company shrinks its vast product portfolio to focus on faster-growing brands such as Pampers diapers and Pantene shampoo.P&G's organic sales – sales excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency impact – increased 1 percent in the third quarter ended March 31.But, analysts have warned that the Cincinnati-based company's reliance on price hikes, rather than volume growth, to boost organic sales would be unsustainable.P&G continues to expect organic sales to rise in the low-single digits percentage range in the fiscal year ending June, but sales would be driven by volume rather than pricing in the next two to four quarters, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a media call. The company, whose shares were down 0.5 percent at $80.94 in early trading, said it expects core earnings for the current quarter to be ""significantly lower"" than a year earlier due to increased advertising costs, a higher tax rate and negative currency impacts.P&G had lost market share as it has been slow to react to changing trends in key markets including China. But under Chief Executive David Taylor, who took over from A.G.

Markets see no chance of an interest rate increase at the meeting that is set to begin on Tuesday but have priced in a one-in-five chance of a hike at the meeting in June. Fed officials have repeatedly said a hike in June is on the cards.While job growth has continues to gain strength, inflation stubbornly remains below the Fed's 2 percent target.""Investors are focused on the Fed's language and especially their statements of the global and economic developments and to what degree those items pose risks,"" said Bill Merz, investment strategist at U.S. Bank.Investors will also assess earnings reports from major players such as Apple, AT&T and Ebay, which are due to report after the market close. First-quarter earnings from S&P 500 components are expected to have fallen 7.3 percent from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Of the 135 companies that have reported, 59 percent reported revenue above analyst expectations, just short of the average 60 percent since 2002.""Expectations are low and while companies are modestly beating them, the returns over the past couple of months have been due to multiple expansions and not fundamental growth and current prices are slightly high,"" said Merz.With the S&P 500 up in eight of the past 10 weeks and nearing the record high set almost a year ago, traders are struggling to find reasons to push it even higher as underwhelming earnings and the specter of higher interest rates hover over markets.At 10:54 a.m. ET (1454 GMT) the Dow Jones industrial average  was down 24.93 points, or 0.14 percent, at 17,952.31, the S&P 500 was unchanged at 2,087.79 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 16.35 points, or 0.33 percent, at 4,879.44. Six of the 10 major S&P sectors were higher, with the energy  and materials index's 0.7 percent rise leading the advancers.Oil prices were up about 2 percent due to a weaker dollar and hopes for an easing of the global oil glut.Orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rebounded less than expected in March. The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that orders for durable goods increased 0.8 percent last month, below the 1.8 percent rise expected by economists polled by Reuters.Adding to the day's pressure, the consumer confidence index fell to 94.2 in April and came in below expectations.Shares of Apple were down 0.6 percent at $104.43. The world's largest public company is expected to report a fall in quarterly revenue on weakened demand for its smartphones.Whirlpool was down 5.6 percent at $175.60 after its profit missed expectations.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,941 to 872. On the Nasdaq, 1,323 issues rose and 1,247 fell.The S&P 500 index showed 15 new 52-week highs and 1 new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 28 new highs and 18 new lows.

380,"   By Yashaswini Swamynathan  Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N), the maker of Tide detergent and Gillette shaving products, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, boosted by cost-cutting and higher selling prices.However, P&G's sales declined for the seventh quarter in a row as higher prices weighed on volumes and as the company shrinks its vast product portfolio to focus on faster-growing brands such as Pampers diapers and Pantene shampoo.P&G's organic sales – sales excluding acquisitions, divestitures and currency impact – increased 1 percent in the third quarter ended March 31.But, analysts have warned that the Cincinnati-based company's reliance on price hikes, rather than volume growth, to boost organic sales would be unsustainable.P&G continues to expect organic sales to rise in the low-single digits percentage range in the fiscal year ending June, but sales would be driven by volume rather than pricing in the next two to four quarters, Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a media call. The company, whose shares were down 0.5 percent at $80.94 in early trading, said it expects core earnings for the current quarter to be ""significantly lower"" than a year earlier due to increased advertising costs, a higher tax rate and negative currency impacts.P&G had lost market share as it has been slow to react to changing trends in key markets including China. But under Chief Executive David Taylor, who took over from A.G. Lafley in November, P&G has ramped up advertising spending to regain its footing.The company now expects full-year core earnings to fall 3-6 percent, compared with the decline of 3-8 percent it had estimated in January.

""We're taking this important step to position the Duracell business for growth."" Duracell said the move will lead to ""some"" job growth in LaGrange, which is about 330 miles (531 km) southwest of Lancaster, and that Lancaster workers will be encouraged to apply for work there.The company, which said it has about 3,000 employees, also makes C and D batteries in a plant in Cleveland, Tennessee. Berkshire acquired Bethel, Connecticut-based Duracell plus $1.8 billion of cash on Feb. 29 in exchange for about $4.2 billion of stock it held in Procter & Gamble Co, Duracell's former owner.Since 1965, Buffett has built Berkshire into a conglomerate with roughly 90 operating businesses employing more than 360,000 people.

416,"   By Jessica Kuruthukulangara and Siddharth Cavale  Beauty products maker Coty Inc (COTY.N) reported lower-than-expected quarterly revenue, due to a slump in demand for its fragrances and color cosmetics, and said the slowdown in revenue would continue in the current quarter.The company's stock fell as much as 15.6 percent to $18.48 on Wednesday, a day after the U.S election, its lowest level since January last year.On a call with analysts, executives attributed the continuing sales weakness to distractions caused by the integration of Procter & Gamble Co's (PG.N) specialty beauty business, which Coty acquired for $12.5 billion.""People are not necessarily fully focused on the business ... they are in transition ... helping out on the integration of the business so those have caused distractions and caused us to lose momentum in the business,"" Coty Chairman Bart Becht said on the call.The company also said that challenges in the consumer beauty business and the previously-announced sale of 6-8 percent of its product portfolio would hurt second-quarter sales.Becht said the results of the recently concluded U.S. presidential election do not affect the company's plans. SALES LOSE SHINE     Fragrance sales fell 9 percent on a like-for-like basis, while color cosmetics fell 6 percent in the first quarter ended Sept. 30. These two segments are its biggest contributors to revenue. ""This period of integration for Coty has been met with less than stellar underlying performance and lack of clarity has created anxiety in the stock,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink said in a note.Coty has inked multiple deals to transform itself into a global beauty products giant, as it reduces its dependence on its struggling fragrance business.After buying P&G's specialty beauty business, the company acquired ghd, a high-end hairstyling appliance brand, from private equity firm Lion Capital LLP for about $522 million. Coty posted no profit during the first quarter ended Sept. 30. In the year-earlier quarter, the company reported a net income of $125.7 million, or 34 cents per share.Net revenue fell to $1.08 billion from $1.11 billion.Analysts on average had expected revenue of $1.14 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of Coty, which owns cosmetics brands like COVERGIRL and Rimmel, were down 13.2 percent in early trading.

419,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Progressive  Corporation's (NYSE: PGR) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A+', senior debt  ratings of 'A', and junior debt rating of 'BBB+'. Fitch also affirms  Progressive's operating subsidiaries' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at  'AA'. A complete list of ratings follows the end of the release. The Rating  Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's affirmation follows PGR's announcement that it entered into an agreement  to acquire a controlling interest in ARX Holding Corporation (ARX), the parent  company of homeowners' insurance specialist American Strategic Insurance (ASI),  for total consideration of $875 million in cash, a price that represents  approximately 2.6 times book value. The transaction would bring PGR's ownership  interest in ARX to 67% from its current 5% stake in the company acquired in  2012.  The transaction is expected to close by April 1, 2015, subject to closing  conditions. PGR also has the option to purchase the remaining 33% of ARX over  the next six years. ASI's management team is expected to remain in place and the  company will continue to be run as a separate entity.  PGR is expected to use ARX to enhance product offerings that include bundled  personal auto and homeowners policies which have historically been a limited  segment for the company but could in time become a larger portion of PGR's  business mix. ARX's net premiums through nine months 2014 represent  approximately 4% of Progressive's overall net premiums written during the  period.  As primarily a Florida and Gulf Coast writer of homeowners' insurance policies,  ARX presents an increased presence of gross catastrophe loss exposures for PGR.  ARX has traditionally relied on substantial catastrophe reinsurance coverage to  manage net catastrophe exposures.  The company has experienced significant  premium growth and generated favorable underwriting results over the last five  years, and has fortunately not experienced large catastrophe related losses over  this period. Looking forward, there is some uncertainty regarding future expansion plans by  PGR in the homeowners' line in terms of overall premium growth targets and  geographic business mix, and strategies for managing gross and net of  reinsurance catastrophe exposures. Homeowners' growth that substantially  increases probable maximum loss (PML) levels could lead to a negative change in  ratings or Rating Outlooks.    Fitch's ratings for Progressive continue to be based on excellent operating  performance, pricing and underwriting expertise, a unique personal auto  insurance franchise, conservative investment allocation, and strong risk-based  capital position.   Fitch continues to view Progressive as one of the strongest underwriters among  major property/casualty companies, and recognizes the company's history of  strong underwriting margins and stability. Progressive's financial leverage, as measured by total debt to total capital, is  expected to remain within a reasonable range for the rating category in the near  term.  The company's financial leverage at Sept. 30, 2014 was 24.1%.  Progressive's profitability promotes strong interest coverage.  Annualized GAAP  fixed charge coverage at nine months 2014 was 14.4x, up from year-end 2013 of  12.8x.  Fitch believes that GAAP fixed charge coverage will range from high  single digits to low double digits over the near term.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that could lead to a ratings downgrade include: --Obtaining a GAAP calendar-year combined ratio of 99% or higher;  --Failure to maintain a Prism score of 'Very Strong' or better. Based on  year-end 2013 data PGR's Prism score was 'Very Strong'; --An increase in statutory net leverage, defined as net written premiums plus  total liabilities relative to policyholders surplus plus Progressive Investment  Company, Inc's assets, above 5x;  --Failure to maintain statutory maximum dividend coverage ratio of 7x or higher  on a sustained basis; --A meaningful change to the auto insurance market that unfavorably alters the  operating environment; -- Homeowners' growth that substantially increases PML levels. Fitch believes that a ratings upgrade for Progressive is unlikely in the near  term given the company's narrow product focus and high notional leverage.   Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Stable Outlook: The Progressive Corporation --IDR at 'A+'; --$500 million 3.75% due Aug. 23, 2021 at 'A'; --$300 million 6.625% due March 31, 2029 at 'A'; --$400 million 6.25% due Dec. 1, 2032 at 'A'; --$350 million 4.35% due Apr. 25, 2044 at 'A'; --Junior subordinated debentures at 'BBB+'. --$732 million 6.7% due June 18, 2067 at 'BBB+'.

420,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, January 21 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings expects to assign an 'A' rating to  Progressive Corporation's (NYSE: PGR) $400 million issuance of senior unsecured  notes maturing in 2045. The new notes' rating is equivalent to the ratings on  PGR's existing senior debt.  KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's anticipated rating reflects PGR's strong balance sheet and Fitch's  belief that PGR's financial leverage, as measured by total debt to total  capital, will remain within a reasonable range for the rating category in the  near term. PGR's financial leverage at Sept. 30, 2014 was 24.1%. Pro-forma  leverage as of nine months 2014, including the additional debt, will temporarily  increase to 27.3%, within Fitch's expectations. Progressive's profitability promotes strong interest coverage. GAAP fixed charge  coverage through the first nine months of 2014 was 14.4 times (x) up from year  end 2013 of 12.9x. Fitch believes that GAAP fixed charge coverage will range  from high single digits to low double digits over the near term. On Dec. 17, 2014, Fitch affirmed all of its ratings for PGR and PGR's  subsidiaries with a Stable Outlook following the company's announcement that it  entered into an agreement to acquire a controlling interest in ARX Holding  Corporation (ARX), the parent company of homeowners' insurance specialist  American Strategic Insurance (ASI). The acquisition added uncertainty regarding future expansion plans by PGR in the  homeowners' line in terms of overall premium growth targets and geographic  business mix, and strategies for managing gross and net of reinsurance  catastrophe exposures. Further increases in financial leverage or homeowners' growth that substantially  increases probable maximum loss (PML) levels could lead to a negative change in  ratings or Rating Outlooks. RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that could lead to a ratings downgrade include the following: --Obtaining a GAAP calendar year combined ratio of 99% or higher.  --Failure to maintain a Prism score of 'Very Strong' or better. Based on  year-end 2013 data PGR's Prism score was 'Very Strong.' --An increase in statutory net leverage, defined as net written premiums plus  total liabilities relative to policyholders surplus plus Progressive Investment  Company, Inc's assets, above 5.0x.  --Failure to maintain statutory maximum dividend coverage ratio of 7.0x or  higher on a sustained basis. --A meaningful change to the auto insurance market that unfavorably alters  operating environment. --Homeowners' growth that substantially increases probable maximum loss (PML)  levels. Fitch believes that a ratings upgrade for Progressive is unlikely in the near  term given the company's narrow product focus and high notional leverage. Contact: Primary Analyst Christopher A.

421,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed The Progressive  Corporation's (NYSE: PGR) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) of 'A+', senior debt  ratings of 'A', and junior debt of 'BBB+'. Fitch also affirms Progressive's  operating subsidiaries' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating at 'AA'. A  complete list of ratings follows the end of the release. The Rating Outlook is  Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS Fitch's ratings are based on Progressive's excellent operating performance,  pricing and underwriting expertise, personal auto insurance franchise,  conservative investment allocation, and strong risk-based capital position. Fitch views the company's market position and size/scale as 'Large' and notes  that companies with this profile are typically rated in the 'AA' IFS rating  category. Progressive is the fourth-largest U.S. private passenger auto writer  based on 2014 premium written. Fitch views Progressive's market share and  competitive positioning in its key line of business as slightly favorable  relative to peers. Progressive completed its acquisition of a controlling interest in ARX Holding  Corporation (ARX), the parent company of homeowners' insurance specialist  American Strategic Insurance (ASI) on April 1, 2015. Progressive's Property  segment consists primarily of the business acquired with the ARX transaction and  accounted for approximately 3.2% of total net premiums written by the company in  the third quarter of 2015. Progressive's overall GAAP combined ratio was 92.7% through the first three  quarters of 2015, an improvement over the nine month 2014 result of 92.9%.  Embedded in PGR's culture is obtaining a GAAP calendar year combined ratio of  96% or better. Fitch continues to view Progressive as one of the strongest  underwriters among major property/casualty companies, and recognizes the  company's history of favorable underwriting margins and stability. Capitalization at the operating company level scored 'Very Strong' based on  year-end 2014 data on Fitch's proprietary capital model, Prism, which is  considered consistent with Progressive's 'AA' IFS rating. Total shareholders'  equity increased by 7.6% to nearly $7.5 billion at Sep. 30, 2015, driven by net  earnings of $951 million, offset by $245 million of unrealized investment losses  during the first nine months of the year. Progressive's financial leverage, as measured by total debt to total capital, is  anticipated to remain near current levels in the near term. The company's  debt-to-total capital ratio adjusted for the impact of FAS 115 unrealized gains  on fixed income investments as of Sept. 30, 2015 was 26.8%, following  Progressive's $400 million 1st quarter 2015 senior debt issuance. Progressive's profitability promotes strong interest coverage. GAAP fixed charge  coverage at nine months 2015 was 13.8 times(x), up from the five-year average  between 2010-2014 of 12.1x. Fitch believes that GAAP fixed charge coverage will  range from high single digits to low double digits over the near term. RATING SENSITIVITIES Factors that could lead to a ratings downgrade include the following: --Obtaining a GAAP calendar year combined ratio of 99% or higher.  --Failure to maintain a Prism score of 'Very Strong' or better. --An increase in statutory net leverage, defined as net written premiums plus  total liabilities relative to policyholders surplus plus Progressive Investment  Company, Inc's assets, above 5.0x.  --Failure to maintain statutory maximum dividend coverage ratio of 7.0x or  higher on a sustained basis. --A meaningful change to the auto insurance market that unfavorably alters  operating environment. -- Homeowners' growth that substantially increases probable maximum loss (PML)  levels. Fitch believes that a ratings upgrade for Progressive would require a broadened  product focus with a material reduction of net leverage.

423,"   By Joseph White  Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL] will use Progressive Insurance to provide coverage for drivers in Texas beginning on Friday, in a pilot that could lead the ride-hailing market leader to diversify its U.S. insurance purchasing from its current sole provider, Uber and Progressive executives told Reuters.Uber has been purchasing insurance to cover drivers for its primary ride-hailing services, such as UberX, from James River Insurance Company, a unit of James River Group Holdings (JRVR.O). In the United States, Uber said it covers each ride with $1 million of liability coverage per incident and $1 million of injury coverage for underinsured or uninsured motorists, in addition to other coverage.Recent changes in Texas insurance rules made it more attractive for Progressive to offer a plan to cover Uber drivers there, Uber and Progressive said. Progressive Corp (PGR.N) this year launched ""transportation network companies,"" or TNC insurance product, aimed at individuals who use their vehicles to carry passengers for ride-hailing services such as Uber or its rival Lyft. John Barbagallo, Progressive Insurance’s Commercial Lines group president, said Progressive sees ride-sharing growing. ""We’re excited about the pilot,"" he told Reuters. Other large auto insurers have begun rolling out coverage tailored to ride-hailing service drivers, filling a void that had existed for drivers whose personal policies did not cover accidents that happened when they were driving passengers for pay.Uber's senior director of insurance, Gus Fuldner, said the company does not have immediate plans to use other insurance providers in other states. Uber and Progressive did not disclose financial terms of the Texas program, but did say Uber will be buying coverage for thousands of drivers.James River Group President Bob Myron said his company had expected Uber's move, but said he expects James River will continue to have ""an important relationship with Uber,"" that will grow as the numbers of Uber drivers expands. James River is not aware of other states where Uber plans to switch insurance providers, Myron said.

432,"  (Repeat for additional subscribers)May 22 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings assigns a credit rating of 'BBB' to the EUR500 million aggregate principal amount of guaranteed notes issued by Prologis, L.P., the operating partnership of Prologis, Inc. (NYSE: PLD; collectively including rated subsidiaries Prologis or the company). The 2026 notes have an annual coupon rate of 3% and were priced at 99.138% of the  principal amount to yield 3.087% to maturity or 125 basis points (bps) over the  mid-swap rate.The notes are senior unsecured obligations of Prologis, L.P. that are fully and  unconditionally guaranteed by Prologis, Inc. The company intends to use the net  proceeds of approximately EUR493.2 million for the redemption of $182 million of  5.625% notes due November 15, 2016. The company will use the remaining net  proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment or  repurchase other indebtedness. In the short term, Prologis intends to use the  net proceeds to repay borrowings under its multi-currency senior term loan.In addition to the 2026 notes, Fitch currently rates Prologis as follows:Prologis, Inc.--Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB';--$100 million preferred stock 'BB+'.Prologis, L.P.--IDR 'BBB'; --$2 billion global senior credit facility 'BBB';--$6.2 billion senior unsecured notes 'BBB';--$460 million senior unsecured exchangeable notes 'BBB'.Prologis Tokyo Finance Investment Limited Partnership--JPY45 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB';--JPY10 billion senior unsecured term loan 'BBB'.The Rating Outlook is Stable.KEY RATING DRIVERS Prologis, Inc.'s 'BBB' IDR reflects leverage that remains elevated for the  rating though expected to decline principally via improving property  fundamentals. The rating is supported by the stable cash flow from the company's  global industrial real estate portfolio that contributes towards appropriate  fixed-charge coverage, strong asset quality, and excellent access to capital.Development continues to be a core tenet for the company and Prologis endeavors  to match-fund acquisitions and development expenditures with proceeds from  dispositions and fund contributions, a strategy that can materially impact  corporate liquidity. Contingent liquidity is strong as measured by unencumbered  asset coverage of unsecured debt.High Leverage for 'BBB'; Expected to DeclineCurrent leverage is high for a 'BBB' rating (8.1x pro rata in the first quarter  of 2014 [1Q'14]), but Fitch's base case forecasts that pro rata leverage will  approach 7x by year-end 2014 and 6.5x by year-end 2015, which would be strong  for the 'BBB' rating. However, the decline in leverage may be choppy  sequentially as the timing of dispositions and fund contributions may not match  that of acquisitions and development starts. Fitch defines leverage as net debt to recurring operating EBITDA on a pro rata  basis given PLD's willingness to buy back and/or recapitalize unconsolidated  assets and its agnostic view towardsproperty management for consolidated and unconsolidated assets. Fitch's  methodology differs from that of PLD's, which also seeks to adjust for the  effects of the development business by either including gains on dispositions  and contributions or adjusting EBITDA to reflect future NOI contributions. In a stress case not anticipated by Fitch in which same store net operating  income (SSNOI) declines by levels experienced in 2009 - 2010, leverage would  exceed 8x, which would be weak for a 'BBB' rating.Improving Operating Fundamentals and Cash Flow Support Fixed Charge Coverage  The vast majority of PLD's earnings are derived from property-level net  operating income (NOI), which is complemented by the company's investment  management income. During 1Q'14, cash SSNOI increased by 4.1%  as compared to  1.6% on average for 2013 and net effective rents on leases signed in the quarter  increased 7.0% from in-place rents, a leading indicator for 2014 SSNOI growth.Approximately 8.7% of pro rata base rents expire during the remainder of 2014  followed by 18.9% in 2015, and the current strength of the industrial real  estate market allows such expirations to be an opportunity for additional  growth. Fitch expects PLD's SSNOI growth will be 3% in 2014 followed by similar  growth in 2015 based largely on positive net absorption. Operating portfolio  occupancy was 94.5% as of March 31, 2014, slightly down from 95.1% as of Dec.  31, 2013 and consistent with seasonal patterns but up from 93.7% as of March 31,  2013.Pro forma for the issuance of the EUR500 million 3% senior notes due 2026,  redemption of 5.625% notes due 2016, repayment of borrowings under the unsecured  global line of credit and multicurrency unsecured term loan, 1Q'14 pro rata  fixed-charge coverage is appropriate for the 'BBB' rating would have been 2.0x  (2.1x in 1Q'14) compared with 1.8x in 4Q'13 and 1.9x in 3Q'13. Fitch defines pro  rata fixed-charge coverage as pro rata recurring operating EBITDA less pro rata  recurring capital expenditures less straight-line rent adjustments divided by  pro rata interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.Fitch's base case anticipates that coverage will approach 2.5x over the next  12-to-24 months due to expected SSNOI growth, which is strong for the 'BBB'  rating.Global PlatformThe company's large platform ($51.1 billion of assets under management at March  31, 2014) limits the effects of any one region's fundamentals to the overall  cash flows. PLD derived 83.0% of its 1Q'14 NOI from Prologis-defined global  markets (58.1% in the Americas, 19.6% in Europe, and 5.3% in Asia).Private Capital SimplificationThe company has reduced the total number of co-investment vehicles that it  manages via consolidation and the purchase of assets upon closed end fund  expirations. The majority of funds are infinite life, which eliminates take-out  risk at the fund's maturity. In addition, the fund platform provides an  additional layer of fee income and recurring cash distributions to cover PLD's  fixed charges. Recently formed ventures include Prologis China Logistics Venture  2 with HIP China Logistics Investments Limited and Prologis U.S. Logistics  Venture (USLV) with Norges Bank Investment Management. Strong Asset QualityPLD has a high-quality portfolio as evidenced by a focus on properties with  proximity to ports or intermodal yards, cross-docking capabilities and  structural items such as tall clearance heights. The portfolio has limited  tenant concentration which is a credit strength, with only the top three tenants  comprising more than 1% of annual base rent (ABR). PLD's top tenants at March  31, 2014 were DHL (2.2% of ABR), CEVA Logistics (1.4% of ABR), and Kuehne &  Nagel (1.2% of ABR).Excellent Capital AccessThe company's access to capital is strong as evidenced by the diversified  capital structure which includes secured and unsecured debt from public and  private sources, as well as preferred stock, common and private equity capital.Prologis completed a total of $17.5 billion of capital markets activity in 2013  and $1.2 billion of debt financings and refinancings in 1Q'14, including the  issuance of EUR700 million of Eurobonds. Additionally, the company redeemed  $194.2 million of U.S. senior notes and repaid $239.3 million of secured debt.  The company established an ATM program during 2013 through which it may issue up  to $750 million of common stock, though it has yet to utilize this program.Proactive Liability ManagementIn addition to recent U.S. dollar and Euro denominated bond offerings, tender  offers, and debt repurchases, Prologis upsized its global credit facility in  July 2013 to $2 billion from $1.65 billion and improved all-in pricing to LIBOR  plus 130 bps, a reduction of 40 bps from the prior global credit facility. The  company also recast its Japan revolver in 2013, upsizing this facility to JPY45  billion from JPY36.5 billion.Risks & Returns of DevelopmentDevelopment is a core tenet of PLD's business model, and through multiple  property cycles, Prologis has developed over a thousand properties at  mid-to-high teen percentage margins. Development improves the quality of the  portfolio, creates value via the entitlement, construction and leaseup of new  properties and enables PLD to realize cash gains on the contribution of the  stabilized developments to managed funds.Credit concerns related to development include the effects on corporate  liquidity and inherent cyclicality. As evidenced by the past downturn, when  leasing is insufficient to meet occupancy stabilization levels required for  contribution, partially stabilized developments remain on PLD's balance sheet  and are initially funded with short-term debt at the REIT, thus increasing  leverage and reducing corporate liquidity. Partially mitigating the aforementioned risks is the fact that the total  development pipeline is significantly smaller at approximately $1.9 billion at  March 31, 2014 versus $6 billion (including legacy ProLogis and AMB Property  Corporation) at Dec. 31, 2007. The pipeline's size is large on an absolute basis  but manageable on a relative basis as PLD's share of cost to complete  development represented 2.6% of pro rata gross assets as of March 31, 2014.However, the pipeline entails moderate lease-up risk as build-to-suit projects  represented approximately 38.9% of development starts for first-quarter 2014. In  addition, in May 2014, the company announced that it will develop three  inventory logistics facilities totaling 3.2 million square feet near Tokyo, all  of which are speculative projects.The pipeline should remain active in the coming years due to industrial real  estate supply-demand dynamics. Demand for industrial REIT space is skewed toward  larger and newer facilities from tenants such as e-commerce companies,  traditional retailers, and third-party logistics providers.Match-Funded Liquidity StrategyFitch base case liquidity coverage is strong for the rating at 1.7x for the  period April 1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2015. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as  liquidity sources divided by uses. Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash,  availability under revolving credit facilities pro forma for the 2026 notes  offering, and projected retained cash flows from operating activities. Liquidity  uses include pro rata debt maturities after extension options at PLD's option  and projected recurring capital expenditures.Liquidity coverage would be 1.3x when including dispositions and contributions  as liquidity sources and acquisitions and development starts as liquidity uses.  Assuming an 80% refinance rate on upcoming secured debt maturities, liquidity  coverage would be 1.6x. As of March 31, 2014 near-to-medium term debt maturities  are staggered; 4.0% of pro rata debt matures during the remainder of 2014,  followed by 9.9% in 2015.Prologis has strong contingent liquidity as unencumbered assets (1Q'14 estimated  unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed 8% capitalization rate) cover pro forma  unsecured debt by 2.6x. When applying a stressed 50% haircut to the book value  of land and 25% haircut to construction in progress, pro forma unencumbered  asset coverage improves to a strong 2.8x. However, the company's AFFO payout  ratio was 97.3% in 1Q'14 and 95.4% in 2013, indicating limited liquidity  generated from operating cash flow after dividends.Preferred Stock NotchingThe two-notch differential between PLD's IDR and preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's criteria for corporate entities with an IDR of 'BBB'.  Based on Fitch research titled 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in  Nonfinancial Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis', available on Fitch's web site  at 'www.fitchratings.com', these preferred securities are deeply subordinated  and have loss absorption elements that would likely result in poor recoveries in  the event of a corporate default.Stable OutlookThe Stable Outlook reflects Fitch's expectation that leverage will remain  between 7.0x and 8.0x over the next 12 months, offset by liquidity coverage of  above 1.0x and fixed-charge coverage of around 2.0x over the next 12 months.RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum in the rating and/or  Outlook:--Fitch's expectation of pro rata leverage sustaining below 6.5x (pro rata  leverage was 8.1x in 1Q'14);--Liquidity coverage including development sustaining above 1.25x (Fitch base  case liquidity coverage is 1.7x, but 1.3x when including dispositions and  contributions as liquidity sources and acquisitions and development starts as  liquidity uses);--Fitch's expectation of pro rata fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 2.0x  (pro rata coverage was 2.0x in 1Q'14 pro forma).The following factors may result in negative momentum in the rating and/or  Outlook:--Fitch's expectation of leverage sustaining above 7.5x;--Liquidity coverage including development sustaining below 1.0x;--Fitch's expectation of fixed charge coverage ratio sustaining below 1.5x.",2014-05-22,PLD,"Thu May 22, 2014 | 9:23am EDT","RPT-Fitch Rates Prologis, L.P.'s EUR500MM 3% Notes Due 2026 'BBB'; Outlook Stable",http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-rates-prologis-lps-eur500mm-3-note-idUSFit70203420140522?type=companyNews,0.9985,0.054,0.844,0.102

434,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 11 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the credit ratings for  Prologis, Inc. (NYSE: PLD) and its rated subsidiaries as follows: Prologis, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB';     --$78.2 million preferred stock at 'BB+'. Prologis, L.P. --IDR at 'BBB';     --$2.5 billion global senior credit facility at 'BBB';     --$5.6 billion senior unsecured notes at 'BBB';     --$460 million senior unsecured exchangeable notes at 'BBB'; --EUR500 million multi-currency senior unsecured term loan at 'BBB'. Prologis Tokyo Finance Investment Limited Partnership --JPY45 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility at 'BBB'. --JPY40.9 billion senior unsecured term loan at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook has been revised to Positive from Stable.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The Positive Outlook reflects the material improvement in the company's  liquidity position, increasing cash flow in excess of fixed charges, reflecting  strong property fundamentals and the expectation that leverage will decline to  levels commensurate with a 'BBB+' IDR.  Prologis reduced leverage over the past  year by growing EBITDA and repaying debt with proceeds from asset sales and  contributions to co-investment ventures.  However, leverage remains high for the  'BBB' rating (pro-rata 7.5x in second quarter 2014 [2Q'14] and 7.8x for the  trailing 12 months (TTM) ended June 30, 2014, due in part to the company's land  holdings).     Credit strengths include strong asset quality, excellent access to capital, and  a global platform with diversification by location and tenant.  Prologis has  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt.  The main credit  concerns are the high leverage and the continued increase in the company's  speculative development pipeline which results in elevated lease-up risk.  Material Improvement in Liquidity; Change in Strategy Prologis improved its liquidity position over the past year and Fitch expects  PLD will seek to maintain sufficient liquidity before considering proceeds from  dispositions and contributions. While Fitch expects PLD will continue to match  fund its development expenditures with dispositions and contributions,  maintaining sufficient liquidity before the match-funding reduces the risks to  unsecured bondholders during periods of capital markets dislocation.  The company's liquidity coverage ratio improved to 1.2x for the period July 1,  2014 to Dec. 31, 2016 from 0.8x a year prior as a result of multiple bond  offerings and increased availability under the bank facility agreements, despite  the offsetting effect of using some of the proceeds to tender for longer dated  bonds.  Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by uses  for the period July 1, 2014 to Dec. 31, 2016. Liquidity sources include  unrestricted cash, availability under revolving credit facilities pro forma for  the repurchase of 2017-2018 notes in July 2014, and projected retained cash  flows from operating activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities  after extension options at PLD's option, projected recurring capital  expenditures, and pro rata cost to complete development.  Under a scenario by  which the company's 3.25% exchangeable debentures convert to equity in 2015,  liquidity coverage would improve to 1.5x. On a pro forma basis, only 0.4% of pro rata debt matures for the remainder of  2014, followed by 8.5% in 2015 and 8.1% in 2016.  Internally generated liquidity  is moderate as the company's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio  was 83.5% in 2Q'14, down from 95.4% in full year 2013.  Based on the current  payout ratio, the company would retain approximately $130 million in annual cash  flow.  Improving Fundamentals and Fixed-Charge Coverage Positive net absorption continues to benefit PLD's portfolio while macro  industrial indicators such as manufacturing levels, housing starts and  homebuilder confidence indicate that demand may continue to outpace supply.  The  company's average net effective rent change on rollover was 6.4% for the TTM  ended June 30, 2014, up from 4.5% on average in 2013.  Average occupancy also  increased to 94.5% for the TTM ended June 30, 2014 from 94.1% on average for  2013, and cash same-store net operating income (NOI) grew by 3.6% on average for  the TTM ended June 30, 2014, up from 1.6% on average in 2013.   Pro rata fixed-charge coverage (FCC) was 2.4x in 2Q'14 (2.1x TTM), up from 1.8x  in 2013.  Fitch defines pro rata FCC as pro rata recurring operating EBITDA less  pro rata recurring capital expenditures less straight-line rent adjustments  divided by pro rata interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.   Fitch projects that a minor increase in occupancy and rental rate growth in the  high single digits (since in-place rents over the next several years remain  approximately 10% below market rents) will result in 3%-4% same store NOI  (SSNOI) growth over the next several years.  This should result in FCC  sustaining in the 2.5x to 3.0x range, which is appropriate for a 'BBB+' rating. High Leverage Expected to Decline PLD's 7.5x pro rata debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of June 30, 2014 is high for the  'BBB' rating.  Fitch projects that pro rata leverage will decline through 2016  to approximately 6.5x due primarily to SSNOI growth.  Fitch's leverage threshold  of 6.5x for a 'BBB+' rating for Prologis acknowledges the company's strong asset  quality and lower portfolio yields.  Pro Rata Treatment Fitch looks primarily at pro rata leverage (pro rata net debt-to-pro rata  recurring operating EBITDA) rather than consolidated metrics given Fitch's  expectation that PLD has and would in the future support or recapitalize  unconsolidated entities, its agnostic view toward property management for  consolidated and unconsolidated assets, and its focus on pro rata portfolio and  debt metrics. As a supplementary measure, Fitch calculates consolidated leverage  as consolidated net debt-to-consolidated recurring operating EBITDA plus Fitch's  estimate of recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated co-investment  ventures, since these cash distributions benefit unsecured bondholders.   However, this supplementary measure may understate leverage given the inclusion  of cash distributions from joint ventures but exclusion of the corresponding  non-recourse debt. Fitch does not expect Prologis to take any of the  co-investment ventures' assets or debt onto its balance sheet over the next  several years.   Excellent Access to Capital The company issued $9 billion in unsecured bonds since 2009 (using the proceeds  to refinance and repurchase bonds) and $3.7 billion of follow-on common equity  at a weighted average discount of 1.8% to consensus estimated net asset value.   The company also has a $750 million at-the-market equity offering program,  though it has yet to utilize this program.  Debt issuance volumes have been  particularly strong over the past year as the company has issued EUR1.9 billion  and $1.75 billion of bonds since August 2013.  Strategic capital is another important source of funding for PLD.  In 2014, PLD  formed Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture with Norway's sovereign wealth fund NBIM  (the second venture between NBIM and Prologis following the formation of  Prologis European Logistics Partners Sarl in 2013). Strategic capital raises  also include publicly traded vehicles (FIBRA Prologis and Nippon Prologis REIT).  The company rationalized and restructured certain of its investment ventures to  increase the permanency of its capital and reduce the inter-dependence over the  past several years, which Fitch views favorably. Global Platform Prologis had $51.6 billion of assets under management as of June 30, 2014 and  the global platform limits the risk of over-exposure to any one region's  fundamentals. PLD derived 83.3% of its 2Q'14 NOI from Prologis-defined global  markets (56.2% in the Americas, 21.8% in Europe, and 5.3% in Asia), and the  remaining 16.7% of 2Q'14 NOI was derived from regional and other markets.  The  portfolio generally has proximity to ports or intermodal yards, cross-docking  capabilities and structural items such as tall clearance heights.  The portfolio has limited tenant concentration, which is a credit strength, as  only the top four tenants comprise more than 1% of annual base rent (ABR). PLD's  top tenants at March 31, 2014 were DHL (2.1% of ABR), CEVA Logistics (1.4% of  ABR), Kuehne & Nagel (1.3% of ABR) and Geodis (1.2% of ABR). Adequate Unencumbered Asset Coverage  Prologis has adequate contingent liquidity with unencumbered assets (2Q'14  unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed 8% capitalization rate) to unsecured debt  of 2.0x. When applying a stressed 50% haircut to the book value of land held and  a 25% haircut to construction in progress, unencumbered asset coverage improves  to 2.2x. Increasing Speculative Development  PLD's strategy of developing industrial properties centers on value creation and  complements the company's core business of collecting rent from owned assets.  After construction and stabilization, the company either holds such assets on  its balance sheet or contributes them to managed co-investment ventures. PLD  endeavors to match-fund development expenditures and acquisitions with cash from  dispositions or contributions of assets to the ventures.  If the company does  not anticipate disposition or contribution volumes, PLD management has stated  that the company would scale back development starts and acquisitions  accordingly, though the sector has a mixed track record of forecasting market  cycles. Fitch views PLD's improved focus on risk management related to its business,  including development (i.e. Prologis Integrated Risk Index) favorably.  Development is substantially smaller today with total expected investment (TEI)  at 9.1% of undepreciated assets at June 30, 2014 versus 31.8% at year-end 2007  (ProLogis and AMB Property Corporation pro forma).

435,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, October 02 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings assigns a credit rating of 'BBB' to  the EUR600 million aggregate principal amount of guaranteed notes issued by  Prologis, L.P., the operating partnership of Prologis, Inc. (NYSE: PLD;  collectively including rated subsidiaries Prologis or the company).  The 2020  notes have an annual coupon rate of 1.375% and were priced at 99.834% of the  principal amount to yield 1.404% to maturity or 85 basis points (bps) over the  mid-swap rate. The notes are senior unsecured obligations of Prologis, L.P. that are fully and  unconditionally guaranteed by Prologis, Inc. The company intends to use the net  proceeds of approximately EUR596.9 million for general corporate purposes,  including the acquisition and development of European properties and additional  investments in European co-investment ventures. In the short term, Prologis  intends to use the net proceeds to repay borrowings under its global line of  credit and/or multi-currency senior term loan. In addition to the 2020 notes, Fitch currently rates Prologis as follows: Prologis, Inc. --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'BBB'; --$78.2 million preferred stock 'BB+'. Prologis, L.P. --IDR 'BBB'; --$2.5 billion global senior credit facility 'BBB'; --$5.6 billion senior unsecured notes 'BBB'; --$460 million senior unsecured exchangeable notes 'BBB'; --EUR500 million multi-currency senior unsecured term loan 'BBB'. Prologis Tokyo Finance Investment Limited Partnership --Senior unsecured guaranteed notes 'BBB'; --JPY45 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility 'BBB'; --JPY40.9 billion senior unsecured term loan 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Positive. KEY RATING DRIVERS The Positive Outlook reflects the material improvement in the company's  liquidity position, increasing cash flow in excess of fixed charges, reflecting  strong property fundamentals and the expectation that leverage will decline to  levels commensurate with a 'BBB+' IDR. Prologis reduced leverage over the past  year by growing EBITDA and repaying debt with proceeds from asset sales and  contributions to co-investment ventures. However, leverage remains high for the  'BBB' rating (pro rata 7.5x in second quarter 2014 [2Q'14] and 7.8x for the  trailing 12 months (TTM) ended June 30, 2014, due in part to the company's land  holdings). Credit strengths include strong asset quality, excellent access to capital, and  a global platform with diversification by location and tenant. Prologis has  adequate unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt. The main credit concerns  are the high leverage and the continued increase in the company's speculative  development pipeline which results in elevated lease-up risk. Material Improvement in Liquidity; Change in Strategy Prologis improved its liquidity position over the past year and Fitch expects  the company will seek to maintain sufficient liquidity before considering  proceeds from dispositions and contributions. While Fitch expects PLD will  continue to match-fund its development expenditures with dispositions and  contributions, maintaining sufficient liquidity before the match-funding reduces  the risks to unsecured bondholders during periods of capital markets  dislocation. The company's liquidity coverage ratio improved to 1.3x for the period July 1,  2014 to Dec. 31, 2016 from 0.8x a year prior as a result of multiple bond offerings and increased  availability under the bank facility agreements, despite the offsetting effect  of using some of the proceeds to tender for longer dated bonds. Fitch defines  liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by uses for the period July 1,  2014 to Dec. 31, 2016. Liquidity sources include unrestricted cash, availability  under revolving credit facilities pro forma for the repurchase of 2017-2018  notes in July 2014 and senior notes due 2020, and projected retained cash flows  from operating activities. Liquidity uses include pro rata debt maturities after  extension options at PLD's option, projected recurring capital expenditures, and  pro rata cost to complete development. Under a scenario by which the company's  3.25% exchangeable debentures convert to equity in 2015, liquidity coverage  would improve to 1.5x. On a pro forma basis, only 0.4% of pro rata debt matures for the remainder of  2014, followed by 8.5% in 2015 and 8.1% in 2016. Internally generated liquidity is moderate as the  company's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) payout ratio was 83.5% in 2Q'14,  down from 95.4% in full-year 2013.  Based on the current payout ratio, the  company would retain approximately $130 million in annual cash flow. Improving Fundamentals and Fixed-Charge Coverage Positive net absorption continues to benefit Prologis' portfolio while macro  industrial indicators such as manufacturing levels, housing starts and  homebuilder confidence indicate that demand may continue to outpace supply. The  company's average net effective rent change on rollover was 6.4% for the TTM  ended June 30, 2014, up from 4.5% on average in 2013. Average occupancy also  increased to 94.5% for the TTM ended June 30, 2014 from 94.1% on average for  2013, and cash same-store net operating income (NOI) grew by 3.6% on average for  the TTM ended June 30, 2014, up from 1.6% on average in 2013. Pro rata fixed-charge coverage (FCC) was 2.4x in 2Q'14 (2.1x TTM), up from 1.8x  in 2013. Fitch defines pro rata FCC as pro rata recurring operating EBITDA less  pro rata recurring capital expenditures less straight-line rent adjustments  divided by pro rata interest incurred and preferred stock dividends.  Fitch projects that a minor increase in occupancy and rental  rate growth in the high single digits (since in-place rents over the next  several years remain approximately 10% below market rents) will result in 3%-4%  same store NOI (SSNOI) growth over the next several years. This should result in  FCC sustaining in the 2.5x to 3.0x range, which is appropriate for a 'BBB+'  rating. High Leverage Expected to Decline The company's 7.5x pro rata debt-to-EBITDA ratio as of June 30, 2014 is high for  the 'BBB' rating. Fitch projects that pro rata leverage will decline through  2016 to approximately 6.5x due primarily to SSNOI growth. Fitch's leverage  threshold of 6.5x for a 'BBB+' rating for Prologis acknowledges the company's  strong asset quality and lower portfolio yields. Pro Rata Treatment Fitch looks primarily at pro rata leverage (pro rata net debt-to-pro rata  recurring operating EBITDA) rather than consolidated metrics given Fitch's  expectation that PLD has and would in the future support or recapitalize  unconsolidated entities, its agnostic view toward property management for  consolidated and unconsolidated assets, and its focus on pro rata portfolio and  debt metrics. As a supplementary measure, Fitch calculates consolidated leverage as  consolidated net debt-to consolidated recurring operating EBITDA plus Fitch's  estimate of recurring cash distributions from unconsolidated co-investment  ventures, since these cash distributions benefit unsecured bondholders.   However, this supplementary measure may understate leverage given the inclusion  of cash distributions from joint ventures but exclusion of the corresponding  non-recourse debt. Fitch does not expect Prologis to take any of the  co-investment ventures' assets or debt onto its balance sheet over the next  several years. Excellent Access to Capital The company issued $7.1 billion and EUR2.5 billion in unsecured bonds since 2009  (using the proceeds to refinance and repurchase bonds and for general corporate  purposes) and $3.7 billion of follow-on common equity at a weighted average  discount of 1.8% to consensus estimated net asset value. The company also has a  $750 million at-the-market equity offering program, though it has yet to utilize  this program. Debt issuance volumes have been particularly strong over the past  year as the company has issued EUR2.5 billion and $1.75 billion of bonds since  August 2013. Strategic capital is another important source of funding for PLD. In 2014, PLD  formed Prologis U.S. Logistics Venture with Norway's sovereign wealth fund NBIM (the second  venture between NBIM and Prologis following the formation of Prologis European Logistics  Partners Sarl in 2013).  Strategic capital raises also include publicly traded  vehicles (FIBRA Prologis and Nippon Prologis REIT). The company rationalized and  restructured certain of its investment ventures to increase the permanency of  its capital and reduce the inter-dependence over the past several years, which  Fitch views favorably. Global Platform Prologis had $51.6 billion of assets under management as of June 30, 2014 and  the global platform limits the risk of over-exposure to any one region's  fundamentals. PLD derived 83.3% of its 2Q'14 NOI from Prologis-defined global  markets (56.2% in the Americas, 21.8% in Europe, and 5.3% in Asia), and the  remaining 16.7% of 2Q'14 NOI was derived from regional and other markets. The portfolio generally has proximity to ports or intermodal yards,  cross-docking capabilities and structural items such as tall clearance heights.   The portfolio has limited tenant concentration, which is a credit strength, as  only the top four tenants comprise more than 1% of annual base rent (ABR). PLD's  top tenants at March 31, 2014 were DHL (2.1% of ABR), CEVA Logistics (1.4% of  ABR), Kuehne & Nagel (1.3% of ABR) and Geodis (1.2% of ABR). Adequate Unencumbered Asset Coverage Prologis has adequate contingent liquidity with a stressed value of unencumbered  assets (2Q'14 unencumbered NOI divided by a stressed 8% capitalization rate) to  net unsecured debt of 2.0x. When applying a 50% haircut to the book value of  land held and a 25% haircut to construction in progress, unencumbered asset  coverage improves to 2.2x. Increasing Speculative Development PLD's strategy of developing industrial properties centers on value creation and  complements the company's core business of collecting rent from owned assets.  After construction and stabilization, the company either holds such assets on  its balance sheet or contributes them to managed co-investment ventures. PLD  endeavors to match-fund development expenditures and acquisitions with cash from  dispositions or contributions of assets to the ventures. If the company does not  anticipate disposition or contribution volumes, PLD management has stated that  the company would scale back development starts and acquisitions accordingly,  though the sector has a mixed track record of forecasting market cycles. Fitch views PLD's improved focus on risk management related to its business,  including development (i.e. Prologis Integrated Risk Index) favorably.  Development is substantially smaller today with total expected investment (TEI)  at 9.1% of undepreciated assets at June 30, 2014 versus 31.8% at year-end 2007  (ProLogis and AMB Property Corporation pro forma). Costs to complete are 3.7% of  undepreciated assets at June 30, 2014 (2.8% pro rata) compared with 14.1% at  year-end 2007. However, speculative development increased post-merger to 82.4%  at June 30, 2014 from 58.2% in 2013 and 43.2% in 2012, which illustrates  elevated lease-up risk. Preferred Stock Notching The two-notch differential between PLD's IDR and its preferred stock rating is  consistent with Fitch's 'Treatment and Notching of Hybrids in Nonfinancial  Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis' criteria report dated Dec. 23, 2013, as  PLD's preferred securities have cumulative coupon deferral options exercisable  by PLD and thus have readily triggered loss-absorption provisions in a going  concern.

448,"   By David Randall | NEW YORK  NEW YORK With Amazon and other e-commerce sites continuing to take market share from malls and other physical retailers, U.S. mutual fund managers are upping their bets on an overlooked part of the online shopping boom: warehouses.Real estate investment trusts (REITs) that own the distribution centers required to fill all those Amazon Prime boxes are a growing favorite on Wall Street after two years of underperformance compared with the broad real estate market. In large part, the move comes about because of changes in the supply chains of online retail giants like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) over the last few years as they focus on fast, two-day shipping. Whereas a traditional retailer might send a pallet full of merchandise to a store, online shippers send out individual packages. That requires significantly more space to hold greater amounts of inventory on hand and to route all those boxes, said Eric Frankel, an analyst at research firm Green Street Advisors. That has allowed companies such as Prologis Inc (PLD.N) - which counts Amazon among its largest customers - to raise rents a record 20.1 percent in the first three months of the year. Even with the rent increases seen this year, warehouse occupancy rates are at their highest since 2000, making rent spikes across the industry likely for newer, modern warehouses near major cities, according to Green Street. ""We think the shift to e-commerce is just going to create more demand for warehouses and while those aren't the sexiest parts of the industry, that's where the demand is,"" said Nate Weisshaar, a portfolio manager at Motley Fool Asset Management. He has been adding to his position in Stag Industrial Inc (STAG.N), a warehouse company whose shares are up 24 percent year-to-date.  Total fund ownership of real estate companies such as Prologis Inc and Duke Realty Corp (DRE.N) has jumped by 30 percent or more over the last quarter, according to Morningstar data. At the same time, their share prices are up 15 percent or more for the year to date, well outpacing the 3-percent gain in the benchmark S&P 500, or the 9.9-percent increase in the Dow Jones All REIT index. ANOTHER CATALYST   The rally in warehouse stocks has sent the shares like Prologis to their highest levels since before the 2008 financial crisis. Some fund managers expect the rally to continue, in part because of a technical change by S&P that will recognize real estate as its own sector, rather than a part of financials. That will require active U.S. equity fund managers - who have traditionally been underweight real estate - to buy more than $100 billion in real estate shares to reach a market neutral position, according to J.P. Morgan. ""You're going to see more adoption of REITs overall, especially on the part of managers who haven't held the sector before, and they're going to gravitate to what they know,"" said Mike Underhill, portfolio manager at RidgeWorth Investments. Underhill estimates Prologis will be among the companies that see the largest inflows as a result of the change because of its connection to the more-familiar consumer discretionary sector. He is also bullish on mid-cap REITs such as DCT Industrial Trust Inc (DCT.N), which has been expanding its urban distribution centers in areas such as Atlanta and Washington DC in order to make it easier to fulfill next-day delivery orders.""These industrial REITs are caught up in the same paradigm shift that's been a negative for bricks and mortar retailers, but on the other side of it,"" he said.

450,"  * Will look at other financing channels if necessary-CEO* Will buy more overseas retail, entertainment brands-CEO* Fosun, Prudential to launch China real estate ventureBy Kazunori TakadaSHANGHAI, Jan 22 Chinese conglomerate Fosun International Ltd reassured investors on Wednesday that it has enough cash on hand to fund the 1 billion euro ($1.35 billion) purchase of the insurance arm of a Portuguese state bank and it will continue to buy foreign assets to expand its overseas reach.Rating agency Moody's Investors Service has put Fosun's debt under review for a possible downgrade, citing uncertainties over its funding plan for the purchase of the insurance unit of Caixa Geral de Depositos SA which comes after a series of investments last year.Liang Xinjun, chief executive of Fosun, declined to disclose its funding plan for the deal, but said the company has enough cash on hand to pay for it. ""Our own balance sheet is fully capable of paying for it, but we will also consider other funding channels,"" he told Reuters in an interview, adding the firm saw strong growth in profit last year which will help its balance sheet. The 2013 financial results have not yet been published.Fosun had 20 billion yuan ($3.31 billion) in cash as of 2012 and 10 billion yuan of securities assets which it could sell if needed, Liang said.Liang was speaking after announcing a plan to launch a real estate joint venture with Prudential Financial Inc which will target urban projects in China. The companies did not give a size for their investment, but said without elaborating that they also expect to work together on real estate projects outside of China. The real estate venture is the latest move by Fosun which is aiming to become a Chinese version of Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway Inc by using insurance investments as a base to fund long-term investments in larger companies.Fosun's chairman, Guo Guangchang, said the Prudential deal ""marks a solid step for Fosun to develop Warren Buffet's model.""Co-founded by Guo, Liang and two classmates from Shanghai's prestigious Fudan University in 1992 with capital of just $4,000, Fosun initially set up as a market research firm. It then moved into the pharmaceutical business in 1997 before expanding further into areas like steel, retail, mining and insurance. Both Guo and Liang are ranked among China's top billionaires, according to Forbes.Fosun, which is headquartered in Shanghai, is currently bidding to acquire French resort company Club Mediterranee SA , after paying $725 million for One Chase Manhattan Plaza in New York last year. It also obtained a 9.5 percent stake in Greece's largest jewellery retailer Folli Follie    in 2011. Liang said Fosun will continue to buy overseas assets in sectors such as retail, entertainment and finance to be brought over to the Chinese market.""In the future, while continuing our investment on luxury brands, we will also consider brands of experimental consumption and retail financing,"" he said.Fosun also holds stakes in China's Yongan Property Insurance Co, Hong Kong-based Peak Reinsurance Co, and has formed a private equity venture with U.S. buyout firm the Carlyle Group LP.",2014-01-22,PRU,"Wed Jan 22, 2014 | 5:39am EST",UPDATE 1-China's Fosun says has enough cash to fund Portuguese insurance deal,http://www.reuters.com//article/fosun-prudential-idUSL3N0KU25L20140122?type=companyNews,0.9921,0.01,0.895,0.096

455,"   By Tim McLaughlin | March 26  March 26 Bets on financial companies and Europe's beat-up economy helped maintain a decade-long winning streak at the Delaware Extended Duration Bond Fund rolling in 2013.The $603 million Delaware fund recently received the U.S. Lipper 2014 Excellence in Fund Management award. It swept Lipper's 3-year, 5-year and 10-year categories for corporate debt BBB-rated funds.The fund has been the top dog in a field with some big stars, including Dan Fuss, whose track record at Loomis Sayles has earned him the nickname ""The Buffett of Bonds.""""The fixed income team at Delaware has done an outstanding job delivering top performance in a field crowded with talent,"" said Jeff Tjornehoj, head of Lipper Americas Research. He also cited Mark Kiesel at Pimco as a tough competitor.Tjornehoj said the Delaware fund dives into longer maturities and emerges with terrific results.""Relative to many of its peers, it's not the smoothest ride for investors,"" Tjornehoj said. ""But over the long run, they've actually delivered less volatility than the fund's benchmark while still beating it substantially by almost two percentage points per year over the last ten years.""The Delaware fund can also be contrarian, not unlike a stock picker who looks for value in places that other investors flee, said Tom Chow, senior vice president and chief investment officer of corporate credit at Delaware Investments. The company is part of Macquarie Group Ltd.""We know what's in the benchmark. But we don't just invest in names in the benchmark. We do our own homework,"" Chow said. In the fiscal year ended July 31, the fund had plenty of exposure to Europe, despite its instability. The fund benefited from investments in Spanish telecommunications provider Telefonica and Italian wireless operator Wind Telecom  as it focused on industries with defensive credit characteristics, such as steady cash flow.""Credit markets are a fascinating place,"" Chow said. ""There are all shades of colors, rather than black and white. It's what keeps things interesting.""The fund's average annual return over the past 10 years was 8.3 percent as of March 25, easily beating the 5.15 percent return on the Barclays Long U.S. Corporate Index. The fund's net expense ratio is 0.96 percent on an annual basis.As an investor in corporate debt, the fund looks for stability and consistency, Chow said.""We don't necessarily need growth for the company to meet their obligations to us,"" Chow said. The fund says it takes a bond-by-bond approach to find undervalued issuers but stays away from debt with unattractive risk-return profiles.Over the past year, the fund saw strength in the financial sector. Bonds of U.K.-based bank Lloyds TSB Bank Plc  and U.S. insurance companies American International Group Inc  and MetLife Inc helped lift the fund's performance. Another U.S. insurance provider, Prudential Financial Inc, also boosted the fund's results, according to disclosures to investors.TEAMWORK OFFSETS RISK  The fund is supported by what Chow describes as a flat organization of 85 people. Portfolio managers, traders and researchers work together constantly to protect the fund from being whipsawed by risk.They have conversations about bond credit quality daily, if not hourly, Chow said.As the U.S. economy stabilizes, Chow has been watching how some corporate management teams become more preferential toward stock investors versus debtholders. Examples include borrowing money at historically low interest rates to repurchase company stock or for corporate takeovers.Those kinds of moves can boost shareholder value and won't likely become a problem for debtholders in A-rated companies, even if the economy sours or operations encounter headwinds. But companies with higher leverage and less resources may not be as resilient, Chow said.""If operations slow down, you generate less cash. That can turn into a problem for bondholders,"" he said.During the 2013 fiscal year, the fund was hurt by exposure to Barrick Gold Corp, the world's biggest gold miner. A 28 percent dive in bullion prices caught producers by surprise, putting balance sheets under stress.Delaware bond funds, including the extended duration fund, sidestepped some of Barrick's problems by being nimble.""We actively managed the funds' positions in these holdings, periodically increasing the funds' exposure at lower prices while reducing the funds' allocations as the securities began to recover,"" Delaware Investments said in its annual report to bond fund investors.

Fed Chair Janet Yellen told lawmakers earlier this year that the Fed recognized that banks and insurance companies differ in some ways and was working to craft capital rules that would reflect those differences.Sullivan, who was active in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), according to a biography on Connecticut's insurance department website, said he would be part of the Fed's Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation.""Tom's strong regulatory experience, comprehension of the insurance sector, and thorough understanding of America's national system of state-based insurance regulation will be a tremendous asset to the board on both domestic and international issues,"" NAIC president Adam Hamm said in a statement.The Fed's regional banks also have been preparing to regulate insurers. Its Boston and New York units, which were given responsibility to oversee Prudential and AIG, have recently advertised positions for people with insurance experience.

462,"   By Linda Stern | NEW YORK, July 16  NEW YORK, July 16 Is there a target on the back of my dress? Because it feels like there is a target on the back of my dress.It was painted there by the financial services industry, which has grown hyper-aware of the fact that women have a lot of money and are about to have a lot more.According to a 2009 study from the Boston College's Center on Wealth and Philanthropy, women will inherit 70 percent of the money that gets passed down over the next two generations, and that excludes the increasing amounts they earn on their own. Women already own more than half of the investible assets in the United States.Companies like Bank of America's Merrill Lynch, Prudential Financial Inc and TD Ameritrade are studying the investing behavior of women, in the hopes of winning more of our dollars.They know that when a husband dies, his widow often switches money managers.Indeed, the Certified Financial Planning Board of Standards is trying to lure more women to the business of financial advice.Sallie Krawcheck, who ran Merrill at Bank of America, recently bought a women's network and started a mutual fund that seeks to invest in companies led or heavily influenced by women.Last week, Barclay's Bank PLC moved in the same direction, creating a Women in Leadership index and related investments.It's great to be wooed, but it's also scary to be the focus of a great marketing effort. It could all end badly if the industry simply pink-washes inferior financial products.Here are a few bits of advice for women and Wall Street, as they circle each other warily: QUESTIONS There will be questions. Women are infamous in some financial advisory circles because we ask so many more questions than men. That is good. Do not invest in something you don't understand. Advisers who want us to invest in complex products and services need to be willing to explain them clearly and simply.FEMALE ADVISERS NOT NECESSARY We don't need our advisers to be women. It's not like going to a gynecologist. A male financial adviser is fine with me, as long as he's competent, straightforward and good with my money. We also don't need pink folders for our statements or ladies' investment products. We like green, and want the products and services that will secure our money and make it grow.Funds that invest in women-led companies may do well in the future; there's some research that diverse boards govern winning companies. But women and men should be cautioned not to be over-dependent on niche funds and not to overpay for them.KEEP COSTS LOW Women control most household income and tend to be price and budget conscious. So don't try to win us with high-priced mutual funds when there are less expensive ones that do the job. Don't charge us a lot to recommend a generic plain-vanilla index fund portfolio we could find on our own.WOMEN, WORRY LESS Survey after survey reveal that women are more afraid of managing money than men (which is not the same thing as being worse at it) and they are more afraid of market risks than are men.Women keep a lower proportion of their money in stocks than men do, even though women live longer and the stock market has long proven itself to be the best place for long-term investors to keep money.ADVISERS, WORRY MORE A good adviser won't prey on those fears; she or he will help female clients overcome their worries and invest in low-cost products that balance risks and rewards.And if they don't? There's another new company out there that is explicitly targeting women investors.  It's called FireMyAdvisor.com.

464,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, August 13 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to $600  million of senior unsecured notes issued by Prudential Financial, Inc. (PFI).  The Rating Outlook for PFI is currently Positive.  KEY RATING DRIVERS The ratings are equivalent to the ratings assigned to PFI's existing senior  unsecured notes, and reflect standard notching based on Fitch's rating criteria. Fitch expects proceeds from the debt issuance to be used for general corporate  purposes including funding debt maturing in 2015. As a result, Fitch's view of  financial leverage is not impacted by this issuance.   PFI's balance sheet fundamentals remain consistent with rating expectations, and  recent financial performance has been strong.  The ratings assigned to PFI and  its subsidiaries continue to reflect the company's very strong competitive  position in the U.S. and Japanese life insurance markets. The Positive Outlook reflects PFI's improved operating and earnings profile,  which has benefited from recent acquisitions and improved market conditions.   Recent financial performance has exceeded rating expectations, and has led to a  material improvement in key credit metrics associated with interest coverage.   Fitch expects PFI's ability to sustain recent improvement in financial  performance, and progress on reducing financial leverage could lead to an  upgrade within the next 12-24 months. RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: --Reduction in financial leverage to 28% or below;  --GAAP interest coverage remaining in the 8x-10x range (based on pre-tax  adjusted operating earnings);  --Stated NAIC RBC ratio remaining near current levels;  --TFC ratio at or below 1.3X;  --Japan's solvency margin ratio remaining above 700%; --No deterioration in the creditworthiness of PFI's Japan business.  Triggers that could result in a downgrade include:  --Financial leverage above 35%;  --Total financing and commitments ratio above 1.5x;  --GAAP interest coverage ratio below 5x;  --Stated NAIC RBC ratio below 400%; --Japan's solvency margin ratio below 600%. Fitch has assigned the following rating:  Prudential Financial, Inc. --$350 million of 2.35% senior notes due 2019 'BBB+'; --$250 million of 4.60% senior notes due 2044 'BBB+'.

The lawsuit said Bank of America's ""wide-ranging fraud"" left Prudential stuck with securities backed by ""countless"" home loans that went into default or foreclosure, or lacked proper title.Prudential said 51.8 percent of the 20,906 home loans it examined had at least one material defect. Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, in August reached a $16.65 billion settlement with federal and state authorities to resolve many of its mortgage-related liabilities linked to the recent U.S. housing and financial crises.The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank plans to appeal a $1.27 billion civil penalty imposed in a U.S. government lawsuit accusing its Countrywide unit of defrauding government-controlled mortgage companies Fannie Mae  and Freddie Mac into buying questionable home loans.U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan set that penalty last July, and on Tuesday rejected Bank of America's request to overturn it.The case is Prudential Insurance Co of America et al v.

482,"  MUMBAI Prudential Financial Inc's (PRU.N) Pramerica Investment Management is buying Deutsche Asset Management's Indian unit for an undisclosed sum, betting on a revival of India's mutual fund industry.Asset managers in India have struggled for years with high redemptions after the financial crisis, hurting profitability.While Deutsche Bank's (DBKGn.DE) sale of its Indian Asset Management business marks the latest foreign asset manager to exit the country, a recent surge in the stock market suggests fund inflows are coming back.Net inflows into equity mutual funds reached $2 billion in June, the second-highest monthly additions since January 2008. The Deutsche deal will help Pramerica Asset Managers Pvt Ltd, which runs its fund management business in a joint venture with local partner Dewan Housing Finance Corporation add assets under management of 207.20 billion rupees ($3.25 billion), nearly 10 times its current book of 21 billion rupees.Deutsche, which set up its asset management business in India in 2003, said it was divesting the asset management unit to focus on its core business. Deutsche's exit is the latest among a series of foreign firms to quit India's highly-competitive fund industry.Last year, Kotak Mahindra Bank bought PineBridge Mutual Fund's Indian schemes, while Morgan Stanley sold its asset management unit to HDFC in 2014.

486,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, December 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed Prudential Financial,  Inc.'s (PFI) 'A-' Issuer Default Rating (IDR).  In addition, Fitch has affirmed  the 'A+' Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating assigned to Prudential  Insurance Company of America and certain other affiliated insurance companies.  The Rating Outlook is Positive.   A full list of ratings can be found at the end  of this release.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The affirmations of PFI and its affiliates' (collectively referred to as PFI)  ratings reflect the company's strong balance sheet fundamentals, and very strong  competitive position in the U.S. and Japan life insurance markets.  PFI's strong  positions relative to competitors provide significant scale advantages  associated with expense efficiencies, spread of risk, and access to  distribution.  Primary rating concerns include challenges associated with ongoing low interest  rates, weak macroeconomic conditions in Japan that may hinder growth in earnings  and revenue, and leverage metrics that have improved over the past year but  remain high relative to the positive outlook.   Fitch views the statutory capital adequacy of PFI's insurance subsidiaries as  strong.  At year-end 2014, PFI reported a combined risk based capital (RBC)  ratio for its U.S. insurance subsidiaries of 502%. PFI's two Japanese insurance  subsidiaries, Prudential of Japan and Gibraltar, reported solvency margin ratios  of 772% and 937%, respectively. Fitch expects statutory capital will be maintained at current levels over the  near term subject to further clarity on pending prudential standards associated  with PFI's designation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) as a  systemically important financial institution (SIFI). PFI has maintained a strong liquidity profile at both the holding company and  insurance subsidiary levels. Holding company liquidity has benefited from an  increasingly diverse stream of cash flows sourced from domestic and  international insurance operations, as well as non-insurance operations (namely  asset management). PFI targets minimum net holding company cash at $1.3 billion. PFI's financial leverage has trended down over the past year to approximately  29%, but remains high relative to the positive outlook. Total leverage as  measured by total financing and commitments ratio (TFC) is above average at  approximately 1.3x. The Positive Outlook reflects PFI's improved operating and earnings profile in  recent years, which has benefited from recent acquisitions and improved market  conditions.  Recent financial performance has exceeded rating expectations, and  has led to a material improvement in key credit metrics associated with interest  coverage and cash flow.  Fitch expects PFI's ability to sustain recent  improvement in financial performance and make further progress on reducing  financial leverage could lead to an upgrade within the next 12-18 months.   RATING SENSITIVITIES Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: sustained reduction  in financial leverage to 28% or below; GAAP interest coverage remaining in the  8x - 10x range (based on pre-tax adjusted operating earnings); stated NAIC RBC  ratio remaining near current levels; TFC ratio at or below 1.3X; Japan solvency  margin ratio remaining above 700%; and no deterioration in the creditworthiness  of PFI's Japan business, including a downgrade in Japan's sovereign rating.  Triggers that could result in a downgrade include: financial leverage above 35%;  TFC above 1.5x; GAAP interest coverage ratio below 5x; stated NAIC RBC ratio  below 400%; and Japan solvency margin ratio below 600%. The Rating Outlook could be revised to Stable if PFI fails to reduce financial  leverage to 28% or below by mid-year 2016. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed the following ratings with a Positive Outlook:  Prudential Financial, Inc. --Long-term IDR at 'A-'; --Senior notes at 'BBB+'; --Junior subordinated notes at 'BBB-'.  --Short-term IDR at 'F2'; --CP at 'F2'.

489,"  (Corrects executive name in fifth paragraph to ""Nitin"" from ""Nitish"")MUMBAI, March 22 India's Edelweiss Asset Management has bought J.P. Morgan Asset Management's India unit, the two firms said on Tuesday, in the latest example of consolidation in the country's fragmented, but reviving, mutual funds industry.Neither firm disclosed the terms of the deal, but two sources familiar with the transaction said J.P. Morgan's business was valued at around 2 percent of assets under management, or 1.4 billion rupees ($20.99 million).Investments into mutual funds by domestic retail investors have surged as a period of low inflation is pushing individuals to search for alternatives to traditional physical assets such as gold and real estate.That is raising expectations of more deals among India's more than 40 asset managers, especially by foreign players looking to exit given the relatively small size of their operations. ""It's the right opportunity, and it gives us critical size,"" Nitin Jain, CEO of Global Asset and Wealth Management at Edelweiss Group told Reuters.""A lot of retail savings are moving towards the mutual fund space, and that's a big theme we are playing for."" With the acquisition of J.P. Morgan's assets under management of 70.8 billion rupees ($1.06 billion), Edelweiss more than quadruples its domestic funds business, bringing its total assets to 87.6 billion, according to a statement by Edelweiss.About 35-40 percent of J.P. Morgan Asset Management's assets were invested in equities, while the rest was is debt, and the Indian firm will absorb the U.S. firm's around 70-strong team, Jain added. Mutual funds in India have seen net inflows of 2.07 trillion rupees in the current financial year, with 822.52 billion rupees  going into equity funds alone.The fortunes of India's asset management sector have revived since 2014, when stock markets started a powerful rally, ending years of scant retail interest in mutual funds.India's mutual funds industry has already seen a slew of deals, including Prudential Financial Inc's purchase of Deutsche Asset Management's India unit last year.

497,"  (Adds Prudential spokesman comment, paragraph 9)By Lindsay DunsmuirWASHINGTON, June 3 Major insurers American International Group Inc and Prudential Financial Inc  would be required to hold enough capital to head off risks to the U.S. financial system as part of a regulatory shakeup of the insurance industry proposed by the Federal Reserve on Friday.The U.S. central bank gained regulatory authority over the two systemically important insurance companies and 12 insurance firms that own banks as a result of the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law designed to strengthen U.S. oversight of Wall Street.Under the proposals, insurance firms that own banks will also face a new set of capital standards. Details on capital requirements for the two types of insurers overseen by the Fed have yet to be determined.The proposals, which have been five years in the making, seek to force the companies to have enough capital on hand to ward off excessive borrowing or insolvency and prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. AIG and Prudential have been deemed ""too big to fail"" because of the outsized threat they pose to financial stability.For them, the Fed proposes a consolidated approach with firms' assets and liabilities categorized into segments based on potential risk with those that pose a higher threat requiring more capital against them.Under a separate proposal, they would also have to comply with new corporate governance and risk-management standards including undergoing regular liquidity stress testing, providing comprehensive cash flow projections and developing contingency funding plans should there be a liquidity crunch. They would also need to maintain a 90-day liquidity cash buffer. Both companies' stocks were little changed following the release of the proposals. AIG did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A Prudential spokesman said in a statement: ""We view this as a positive step forward that recognizes the underlying economics of our businesses.""As insurance companies that own banks are generally less complex and have fewer international activities, the Fed plans a ""building block"" approach in which they would aggregate the capital across a firm's different units to calculate a single requirement. The proposed two-tier framework for the separate types of firms ""reflects the different risks they pose to the safety and soundness of depository institutions and to the financial system more generally,"" Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said in a statement.He added that the central bank had adopted such an approach to avoid unnecessary compliance costs on those who pose the least risk.The Fed currently oversees roughly one quarter of the $8 trillion U.S. insurance industry.MetLife Inc, the largest U.S. life insurer, was previously categorized as systemically important, but a federal judge struck down that designation in March.

510,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, November 15 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has upgraded Prudential Financial,  Inc.'s (PFI) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) and senior debt ratings to 'A' and  'A-', with a Stable Outlook, respectively, from 'A-' and 'BBB+'. In addition,  Fitch has upgraded the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) rating assigned to  Prudential Insurance Company of America and certain other affiliated insurance  companies to 'AA-' from 'A+', with a Negative Outlook. A full list of ratings  can be found at the end of this release.  The IFS ratings encompass PFI's insurance companies operating in the U.S. and  Japan, which are considered ""core"" based on Fitch's criteria, and are rated on a  consolidated basis. The Negative Outlook reflects the consolidated group's large  exposure to Japan, whose sovereign rating is 'A'/Negative Outlook. A downgrade  of Japan's sovereign rating would likely result in the downgrade of PFI's IFS  ratings.  The Rating Outlook pertaining to PFI's holding company ratings is Stable, and  reflects Fitch's view that a downgrade of the IFS ratings triggered by a Japan  sovereign downgrade would not impact PFI's holding company ratings as directly.   KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade of PFI's ratings reflects a sustained improvement in the company's  business and earnings profile in recent years, as it has benefited from recent  acquisitions in the U.S. and internationally.  Further, PFI has made material  progress in recent years to reduce both total and financial leverage, and it is  expected that the company will continue to take steps to further reduce leverage  across the organization over the intermediate term.  PFI's very strong business profile considers the company's market-leading  positions in several major life insurance segments in the U.S. and Japan which  provide PFI significant scale advantages associated with expense efficiencies,  spread of risk, access to distribution, and the ability to invest in its  businesses. Organic and acquisition related growth in recent years has improved  diversification and stability of earnings, revenues, and risk, and has  materially reduced the company's exposure to more volatile businesses, such as  U.S. variable annuity and run-off long-term care businesses.  A key rating sensitivity in recent years has been PFI's persistently high levels  of financial and operating debt used throughout the organization. Over the past  four years, PFI has reduced total debt by almost 30% on an absolute basis, and  financial leverage ratio has declined to approximately 26% at Sept. 30, 2016,  based on Fitch's methodology. Fitch expects PFI to make further progress  reducing outstanding debt and anticipates that financial leverage will decline  further over the intermediate term.  Based on PFI's improved earnings profile and reduced financial leverage, the  company's interest coverage metrics have improved in recent years to levels  consistent with current rating expectations. The level and diversification of  subsidiary cash flows to the holding company for debt service has improved, with  meaningful dividends sourced from domestic insurance, international insurance,  and asset management.   PFI's ratings continue to reflect the company's strong statutory capitalization.  Over the near term, we expect the U.S. insurance subsidiaries to maintain  consolidated risk-based capital ratios in the 500% range, which is consistent  with rating expectations. The U.S. insurance subsidiaries' capital adequacy  based on Fitch's Prism capital model is scored at ""Strong"", which is somewhat  below rating expectations. Further, we expect PFI's Japanese insurance  subsidiaries to maintain regulatory capital ratios in excess of rating  expectations, with solvency margin ratios above 800%. Fitch expects statutory  capital will be maintained at current levels over the near term subject to  further clarity on pending prudential standards associated with PFI's  designation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) as a  systemically important financial institution (SIFI).  PFI's Japan life insurance business accounts for over 40% of total company  earnings. While the earnings profile of this business has been very favorable  and provides strong diversification for the combined organization, the business  is exposed to continued weak macroeconomic conditions. The exposure to Japan  also includes the company's investment concentration in Japan's government  bonds, which are vulnerable to further downgrade of the Japan sovereign rating.  RATING SENSITIVITIES Fitch views PFI's ratings as partially constrained by Japan's sovereign rating,  and does not envision PFI's ratings being set at levels more than two notches  higher than the Japan sovereign. Thus, a one-notch downgrade of Japan's  sovereign to 'A-' would likely result in a one-notch downgrade of the 'AA-' IFS  ratings to 'A+'. Fitch's criteria allow for some compression of traditional  notching when a sovereign constraint is applied, so a one-notch sovereign  downgrade would likely result in an affirmation of PFI's holding company  ratings. Key rating triggers that could result in an upgrade include: sustained reduction  in financial leverage to 20% or below; GAAP interest coverage in the 12x-14x  range (based on pre-tax operating income); stated regulatory capital ratios in  the U.S. and Japan remaining near current levels; Prism capital score of ""Very  Strong""; and total financing and commitments ratio (TFC) ratio at or below 0.8x. Triggers that could result in a downgrade include: GAAP ROE below 10%; financial  leverage above 30%; TFC above 1.5x; stated NAIC RBC ratio below 450%; Japan  solvency margin ratio below 700%; Prism capital score below ""Strong""; and GAAP  interest coverage ratio below 8x.

511,"  NEW YORK U.S. insurer Prudential Financial (PRU.N) is investigating whether Wells Fargo (WFC.N) employees signed up customers for its life insurance policies without their knowledge, a spokesman said on Saturday.Sales practices at Wells Fargo have been under a spotlight since September when federal regulators ordered the San Francisco-based bank to pay $190 million in fines and restitution because they said its high pressure sales environment pushed employees to open as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission.Prudential has a partnership with Wells Fargo to sell a low-cost life insurance policy, known as MyTerm, to the bank's retail customers.Since bankers are not licensed to sell insurance, Wells Fargo employees were meant to direct customers to either self-service kiosks in branches or online to buy the insurance, without getting into specifics about the products. According to a wrongful termination suit filed in New Jersey state court this week by three former managers in Prudential's corporate investigation division, Wells Fargo employees appear to have signed up bank customers for the Prudential policies without the customers' knowledge or permission.In some cases, policies were opened and closed after a month or two and then reopened, and sometimes monthly fees were withdrawn from the accounts, according to evidence in the lawsuit. Scot Hoffman, a spokesman for Prudential Financial, said the insurer had been monitoring its business with Wells Fargo since last year. A customer survey had shown high lapse rates.The insurer expanded the review of how the product was sold after Wells Fargo was fined in September.""We anticipate reviewing this matter with our regulators in due course,” Hoffman said in a statement.

A spokeswoman for Wells said the bank was investigating any alleged misconduct. ""As we have consistently reinforced, if we identify any instances where a customer received a product they didn’t ask for, we will make it right,"" Mary Eshet, a spokeswoman for the bank said in a statement.The lawsuit and the Prudential investigation were first reported by The New York Times.

512,"  NEW YORK The state of California has ordered an investigation into allegations Wells Fargo (WFC.N) retail bankers signed up customers for life insurance policies from Prudential Financial (PRU.N) without their permission.Dave Jones, California's Insurance Commissioner, told Reuters on Monday that his office would hold an inquiry.Earlier on Monday, Prudential Financial said it had suspended the distribution of a low-cost life insurance policy through Wells Fargo, pending a review of how the product was sold by the bank. Wells Fargo's sales practices have been under a spotlight since September when regulators ordered the bank to pay $190 million in fines and restitution to settle charges that its employees opened as many as 2 million deposit and credit card accounts without customers' permission.

513,"  May 13 Public Service Enterprise Group Inc  said on Tuesday it will extend the ongoing refuelling outage at its 1,160-megawatt Unit 2 at the Salem nuclear power plant in New Jersey.The company will use the extra time to inspect all four of the plant's reactor coolant pumps and, if necessary, make repairs.""During the ongoing refuelling outage for Salem Unit 2, a bolting issue was discovered with one of the four reactor coolant pumps that pump water through the reactor coolant system,"" company spokesman Joseph Delmar told Reuters in an email.He said there was no potential for damage to the reactor core or any threat to public health and safety.The company did not say how long it would extend the outage.When the unit shut around April 14 for refuelling, power traders guessed it would return about a month later in mid May.Now they figure the additional inspection could add a couple weeks onto the length of the outage because the company likely will have to remove the pump motors to perform the inspections.""There are huge shield plugs which need to be removed from the upper level of the containment floor and then they would need to use a large crane to remove the motors,"" one trader with experience at nuclear reactors said.Meanwhile, Salem 1 was operating at full capacity.  ---------------------------------------------------------- PLANT BACKGROUND/TIMELINE STATE:        New Jersey     COUNTY:       Salem            TOWN:         Salem along the Delaware River about 40 miles(60 km) south of Philadelphia            OPERATOR:     PSEG's PSEG Nuclear            OWNER(S):     - Salem 1 & 2 - PSEG (57.41 pct)- Exelon (42.59 pct) - Hope Creek  - PSEG (100 pct)            CAPACITY:     3,531 MW            UNIT(S):      - Hope Creek - 1,161-MW General Electric boilingwater reactor- Salem 1 - 1,174-MW Combustion Engineeringpressurized water reactor- Salem 2 - 1,158-MW Combustion Engineering pressurized water reactor- 38 MW Salem 3 - gas turbine           FUEL:         Nuclear; Kerosene (Unit 3)            DISPATCH:     Baseload            COST:         Salem 1 and 2 - $1.3 billionHope Creek - $4.3 billion.

514,"   By Scott DiSavino  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc plans to spend about $3.5 billion over the next five years to expand and modernize its U.S. power plant fleet to remain competitive in the current low natural gas price environment.""The gas industry has done a remarkable job of finding more fuel over the past several years, but that has depressed both gas and power prices. We have to continue modernizing our fleet to keep our plants competitive,"" said Shahid Malik, president of PSEG Energy Resources and Trade.Most of the company's generation investments will go into building new gas plants at Sewaren in New Jersey and Keys in Maryland, adding capacity at nuclear reactors and upgrading existing gas units, Malik said.Rapid growth in gas production in the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia from 1.8 billion cubic feet per day five years ago to 16.5 bcfd now has cut the region's gas prices down to just $1.57 per million British thermal units this year. That is down from a five-year (2010-2014) average of $3.66.With gas so cheap, generators like PSEG are burning more of the fuel and less coal to produce electricity, making it tough for other fuels to compete. ""The markets don't care if electricity comes from solar, gas or nuclear. They buy based on price and since gas is the lowest-cost fuel, it is replacing coal, oil and even some smaller nuclear plants,"" Malik said.PSEG, which still gets most of its power from nuclear, now generates up to 40 percent of the rest from gas plants and just about 10 percent from coal. That is a switch from a few years ago, when coal produced 30 percent of PSEG's power, and gas as little as 20 percent.""You are seeing the slow demise of the coal industry in the United States. It started off due to environmental reasons and is now being pushed downhill by low-cost gas,"" Malik said.PSEG, however, continues to believe in a diversified fleet, including a mix of nuclear, coal, gas and renewables, and has no plans to shut coal plants at this time. ""The coal plants are not making as much money as they had in the past, but do still produce some income,"" Malik said. He noted that some coal units have become peaking plants that run only when demand is very high and they are needed to maintain grid reliability.

515,"   By Scott DiSavino  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc, New Jersey's biggest power company, plans to spend $1.6 billion over five years to expand its natural gas and other power plants to take advantage of cheap prices from swollen gas supplies.""We have been talking about this low gas-price environment for years. We are building new combined-cycle gas units, while also making investments in existing plants to get more out of them,"" William Levis, president and chief operating officer of PSEG Power told Reuters.While PSEG's investments regularly include capital for upgrading and expanding existing units, the combined-cycle plants, planned in its 2015-2019 budgets, would be the first significant new generators built in a decade or so.Combined-cycle facilities are the most efficient gas-fired power plants because they use both gas and steam turbines to get more electricity out of the same fuel than a simple-cycle plant. PSEG is building one in Maryland and another in New Jersey and hopes to build a third in Connecticut, Levis said.""One of the biggest changes we have seen with the collapse in gas prices is that our combined-cycle plants have become one of the workhorses of our fleet,"" Levis said, noting some of the combined-cycle units were running about 70 percent of the time up from just about 20 percent a decade ago. Use of gas as fuel for electricity accelerated over the past decade with the increase in production from shale formations like the Marcellus in Pennsylvania and West Virginia.That increase in output pushed U.S. gas prices down to $2.61 per million British thermal units last year, the lowest level since 1999.  ""We have this dash to gas, which has been good for our country in many ways, creating jobs, lowering energy costs, cleaner for the environment, but we still believe in a diversified fuel supply,"" Levis said, noting PSEG owns nuclear, gas, coal and renewable power plants.Power companies in 2015 may have burned more gas than coal to produce power for the first time in history as generators retired a record number of coal units because weak gas and power prices made it uneconomic to upgrade older coal units to meet stricter federal environmental rules.Levis said PSEG has an agreement in principle to shut its 383-megawatt coal plant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 2021, the only coal plant in the state. Before doing that, PSEG wants to first get approval to build a new gas plant at the site. He said the company hopes to build the new combined-cycle  plant with a capacity of around 500 MW in Bridgeport by the summer of 2019. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes.Levis said PSEG has no immediate plans to shut its other coal plants. ""We will run them as long as we make money at them.""

523,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, March 17 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the credit ratings of  Public Storage (PSA) as follows: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; --$300 million unsecured revolving line of credit at 'A+'; --$3.6 billion preferred stock at 'A'. In addition, Fitch assigned an 'A' rating to the company's $225 million 6.375%  series Y preferred stock priced on March 10, 2014. Fitch does not rate the  company's $700 million one-year unsecured term loan as this is a short-term  obligation. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS The rating affirmation reflects the company's minimal debt, which results in low  leverage and limited refinance risk, coupled with Fitch's expectation of  sustained improvements in fixed-charge coverage due to solid performance of the  company's self-storage property portfolio and lower preferred dividends. Credit  strengths also include strong liquidity and a long management track record.  The rating is balanced by the company's focus on a specialty property type and  moderate portfolio concentration in regions such as California and Texas,  although the portfolio includes over 2,200 properties in 38 states and seven  European countries. UNCONVENTIONAL FINANCING STRATEGY LIMITS REFINANCE RISK Fitch expects PSA's net debt plus preferred stock-to-recurring operating EBITDA  ratio to sustain in the mid-2.0x range over the next 12 to 24 months, which is  solid for the 'A+' IDR. Fitch expects to see modest improvement over the rating  horizon (typically two to three years) due to mid-to-low single-digit same-store  net operating income (NOI) growth and incremental NOI as the company stabilizes  recent developments and acquisitions. In a stress case in which same-store NOI  declines, this metric would approximate 3.0x, which would be consistent with an  IDR of 'A'. PSA's unique financing strategy, which emphasizes preferred equity, results in  minimal refinance risk that supports Fitch's ratings for the company. PSA's  debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA, was 0.6x as of Dec. 31, 2013, compared with  0.3x and 0.2x as of Dec. 31, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2011, respectively. While not  indicative of leverage, given the perpetual nature of PSA's preferred stock, the  ratio of net debt plus preferred stock-to-recurring operating EBITDA was  appropriate for the 'A+' IDR at 3.2x as of Dec. 31, 2013, compared with 2.5x and  2.8x as of Dec. 31, 2012 and Dec. 31, 2011. STRONG FUNDAMENTALS AIDED BY LOW SUPPLY GROWTH Fitch expects PSA's same-store NOI growth to moderate, but remain solidly  positive through 2016. Conservatively, same-store NOI growth should taper off  but remain in the positive low- to mid-single-digits during the forecast period.  Higher rental rates for new and renewal leases will drive the majority of the  gains. Occupancies are expected to remain flat and are conservatively assumed  that expenses grow by approximately 2% per year, compared to expense decreases  of 1.3% and 2.2% in 2013 and 2012. PSA's U.S. portfolio same-store NOI grew by 8.2% during 2013; Europe decreased  by 3.4% due to moderate oversupply in select markets against the backdrop of  weak macro-economic conditions. Low levels of new supply for the industry are  supporting PSA's operating fundamentals. The company's realized annual rent per  occupied square foot in the U.S. same-store portfolio increased by 3.8% to  $14.13 in 2013 from $13.61 in 2012. Weighted average occupancy for the year rose  by 1.4% to 93.3% in 2013 from 91.9% in 2012. PSA's internal growth has slightly lagged its public REIT peers during the last  five years. Since 2009 the company has averaged 3.8% same-store NOI growth vs.  4.3% growth for the sector. PSA's peers have generally benefited from larger  occupancy gains stemming from a greater amount of vacant space at the trough of  the last cycle. Indeed, PSA's occupancy has averaged a 540-basis point premium  to the sector during the last five years, but the spread has compressed from  6.5% in 2009 to 3.2% in 2013. Differences in calculation methodologies can challenge making same-store NOI  growth comparisons across REITs, including self-storage REITs. For example, some  companies will include tenant insurance in same-store NOI; PSA does not.  Additionally, PSA allocates internet marketing expense at the property level  while some of its peers reflect this expense at the corporate level, in general  and administrative expense.   REFINANCING OF HIGHER-COST PREFERRED BOOSTS COVERAGE Fitch anticipates that fixed-charge coverage (FCC) will approach the mid-6.0x  range by 2016, benefiting from preferred stock transactions during 2013. In a  stress case in which same-store NOI declines by approximately 4%, coverage would  fall to the mid-5.5x range, which would remain consistent with the 'A+' IDR. Fitch expects FCC to sustain at levels appropriate for the 'A+' rating. FCC was  6.3x for 2013, compared with 5.5x and 4.7x in 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Improving fundamentals and lower preferred dividends via lower-coupon issuance  used to redeem higher cost preferred stock have contributed towards improving  coverage. Fitch defines coverage as recurring operating EBITDA less recurring  capital expenditures divided by total interest incurred and preferred dividends  and distributions. NEAR-TERM LIQUIDITY PRESSURE PSA's $700 million unsecured term loan that matures on Dec. 2, 2014 is  pressuring its near-term liquidity coverage. The company has taken several  actions subsequent to the year-end to improve its liquidity position. These  include the sale of a 51% interest in its loan to Shurgard Europe ($216 million  of net proceeds) and the issuance of $225 million of preferred equity. Fitch  estimates that the company has paid down $50.1 million of year-end revolver debt  and approximately $300 million under its term loan with the proceeds from these  activities. Pro-forma liquidity coverage has improved to 1.4x from 0.9x at  year-end 2013. Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by uses. Sources  of liquidity include unrestricted cash pro forma, availability from the  unsecured revolving credit facility, and projected retained cash flows from  operating activities after dividends and distributions. Uses of liquidity  include debt maturities and projected recurring capital expenditures. The company has excellent contingent liquidity from a large unencumbered  self-storage property pool. Approximately 97.6% of the company's $12.3 billion  real estate portfolio was unencumbered as of Dec. 31, 2013. Fitch calculates  that based on a 10% capitalization rate on the company's unencumbered property  NOI, unencumbered asset coverage of unsecured debt and preferred stock was 3.2x  as of Dec. 31, 2013 and 3.5x pro forma for the company's sale of a 51% interest  in its Shurgard Europe loan and $225 million preferred equity issuance. DISCIPLINED AND CYCLE-TESTED MANAGEMENT Public Storage's management team has navigated through various commercial real  estate and capital market cycles with a conservative balance sheet, which is  factored into the 'A+' rating. The company's utilization of preferred stock  provides permanent funding for a specialty property type that may be less liquid  than other commercial real estate sectors. This strategy also insulates Public  Storage from weak capital market environments, which Fitch views favorably. MODERATE GEOGRAPHIC PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATION RISK The company has moderate portfolio concentration within certain U.S. regions,  including Southern California at 12% of rentable square feet, Texas at 12% and  Florida at 12%. While not anticipated by Fitch, reduced economic activity and an  increase in price-sensitive customers in geographic regions in which PSA is  concentrated could reduce overall earnings power. STABLE OUTLOOK The Stable Outlook reflects the company's specialty focus coupled with Fitch's  view that fixed-charge coverage will sustain in the mid-6.0x range over the  rating horizon. The Stable Outlook also reflects that the size of the  unencumbered portfolio is also not likely to change materially. The one-notch difference between the company's IDR and preferred stock rating  reflects that unlike the majority of preferred stock issuers in the REIT  industry (which have a two-notch difference between their IDRs and preferred  stock ratings), Public Storage has, and is expected to maintain, limited levels  of debt. Therefore recoveries of preferred stock would likely be stronger than  recoveries of preferred stock of other REITs.  Fitch's ratings for PSA contemplate a moderate level of transitional (i.e.  short-term) unsecured debt in its capital structure used to bridge the timing  gap between completing investments and raising permanent common and/or preferred  equity capital funding. However, the one-notch differential between PSA's IDR  and its preferred obligations has little tolerance for any long-term unsecured  debt in PSA's capital stack.  RATING SENSITIVITIES The following factors may result in positive momentum on the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining above 7.0x (coverage  was 6.3x in 2013); --Fitch's expectation of net debt plus preferred stock-to-recurring operating  EBITDA sustaining below 2.0x (this metric was 3.2x at Dec. 31, 2013). The following factors may result in negative momentum in the ratings and/or  Outlook: --Fitch's expectation of fixed-charge coverage sustaining below 4.0x; --Fitch's expectation of net debt plus preferred stock-to-recurring operating  EBITDA sustaining above 3.0x. In addition, a change in PSA's stated financing strategy that included the  issuance of long-term unsecured debt would likely cause Fitch to revise the  company's preferred obligations down two-notches below its IDR, as opposed to  the current one-notch differential.

524,"  (adds value)By Robert HetzMADRID, June 13 Spain will sell up to 49 percent of heavily indebted AENA, the world's biggest airports operator valued at around 16 billion euros ($22 billion), Public Works Minister Ana Pastor said on Friday.The government is expected to net only about 2.2 billion euros from the sale, not enough to make a major dent in Spain's public deficit. Pastor said the aim was to make management of the company more efficient and attract more tourist flights.After years of losses, AENA turned a profit for the first time last year. The 2011 planned sale of AENA by the former Socialist government failed to get off the ground as Spain's deep economic and fiscal crisis made it difficult to get a good price. The government will sell 28 percent of AENA in a public offering on the Spanish stock exchange, Pastor said, and an additional 21 percent will be auctioned to long-term investors. She did not provide financial details.AENA, which owns 46 airports at home and also has international interests such as a stake in London's Luton Airport, is worth up to 16 billion euros ($22 billion) based on valuations of similar companies at 10 times core profit.The government is expected to raise some 2.2 billion euros with the sale of the non-controlling stake in AENA, given the company's debt of some 11.5 billion euros, according to calculations by sector experts. Some government officials are opposed to the state losing control of a strategic asset. Some of Spain's 17 autonomous regions want to be involved in the management of their airports to make sure fees do not rise and to avoid the closure of loss-making airports.Just 13 of the 46 Spanish airports were profitable in 2013, including Madrid, Barcelona and tourist destinations such as Palma de Mallorca, Ibiza and Tenerife. AENA made a profit of 597 million euros in 2013, after huge cost reductions including staff cuts and after benefiting from airport tax hikes, up from a 215 million euro loss in 2011.Spain is the world's third-biggest tourist destination behind France and the United States. AENA is the biggest airport operator in the world in terms of passengers, handling 187.4 million travellers last year.France and Germany have both partially privatised their airport operators.($1 = 0.7345 Euros)   (Writing by Sonya Dowsett; Editing by David Holmes and Elaine Hardcastle)",2014-06-13,PSA,"Fri Jun 13, 2014 | 11:43am EDT",UPDATE 2-Spain to sell 49 pct of debt-laden airport operator AENA,http://www.reuters.com//article/spain-aena-idUSL5N0OU32720140613?type=companyNews,0.7474,0.065,0.851,0.085
525,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, September 18 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed and withdrawn the  following ratings for Public Storage: --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+'; --Unsecured revolving line of credit at 'A+'; --Preferred stock at 'A'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch has chosen to withdraw the ratings for Public Storage for commercial  reasons. KEY RATING DRIVERS The 'A+' IDR reflects the company's minimal debt, which results in low leverage  and limited refinance risk, coupled with Fitch's expectation of sustained  improvements in fixed-charge coverage (FCC) due to solid performance of the  company's self-storage property portfolio and lower preferred dividends.  Factors that balance the rating include the company's focus on a specialty  property type and moderate portfolio concentration in regions such as California  and Texas; the portfolio includes over 2,478 properties in 38 states and seven  European countries.  Fitch's ratings for PSA do not contemplate new long-term unsecured borrowings in  the company's capital stack. The addition of long-term unsecured debt would  likely cause Fitch to rate PSA's preferred stock two notches below its IDR,  rather than one notch.  The one-notch difference between the company's IDR and preferred stock rating  reflects Fitch's view that recovery prospects for PSA's preferred stock would be  stronger than those for the preferred stock of other REITs, given PSA's lack of  senior unsecured borrowings. Fitch typically rates REIT preferreds two notches  below the issuer's IDR given the deeply subordinated nature and loss  characteristics of the instruments, which would likely result in poor recoveries  in the event of a corporate default.  Fitch's IDR for PSA is also supported by the benefit to its liquidity profile  from its funding strategy that relies on common and preferred equity. Fitch's  would consider downgrading the IDR for PSA were the company to issue a material  amount of new long-term unsecured debt, as Fitch would view this as a change in  financial policy, all else equal. PSA has historically limited its unsecured  debt to shorter-term borrowings under its credit facility and a small amount of  unsecured notes it inherited from its 2006 acquisition of Shurgard Storage  Centers, Inc. that the company repaid at maturity. Strategy Limits Repayment Risk Fitch expects PSA's net debt plus preferred stock-to-recurring operating EBITDA  ratio to sustain in the mid-2.5x range over the next 12 to 24 months, which is  solid for the 'A+' IDR. Fitch anticipates modest improvement through 2017 due to  mid-single-digit same-store net operating income (NOI) growth and incremental  NOI as the company stabilizes recent developments and acquisitions.  PSA's unique financing strategy, which emphasizes preferred equity, results in  minimal refinance risk which supports Fitch's ratings for the company. PSA's net  debt-to-recurring operating EBITDA was 0.1x as of June. 30, 2015, compared with  -0.1x and 0.6x as of Dec. 31, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2013, respectively.  While not indicative of leverage, given the perpetual nature of PSA's preferred  stock, the ratio of net debt plus preferred stock-to-recurring operating EBITDA  was appropriate for the 'A+' IDR at 2.5x as of June. 30, 2015, compared with  2.6x and 3.1x as of Dec. 31, 2014 and Dec. 31, 2013, respectively. Refinancing Boost Fixed-Charge Coverage Fitch anticipates that FCC will approach the low-7x range by 2017, benefiting  from same store NOI growth, the stabilization of recent acquisitions and  development deliveries and the refinancing of its $125 million, 6.5% series P  preferred stock in early October, utilizing the company's revolver.  FCC was 6.7x for the TTM ending June 30, 2015, compared with 6.x and 6.3x in  2014 and 2013, respectively. Improving fundamentals and lower preferred  dividends via lower-coupon issuance used to redeem higher-cost preferred stock  have contributed toward improving coverage. Fitch defines coverage as recurring  operating EBITDA less recurring capital expenditures divided by total interest  incurred and preferred dividends and distributions. Adequate Liquidity Position Fitch's stressed liquidity analysis shows PSA's sources of cash exceeding uses  by 1.4x for the July 1, 2015 to Dec. 31, 2016 period. The company's March 2015  amendment of its revolving credit facility has improved its liquidity profile.  PSA expanded the facility size to $500 million from $300 million and extended  the expiration to March 31, 2020. Unfunded development expenses of roughly $333  million are the company's largest use of cash. The company also has $125 million  earmarked to redeem its series P preferreds in October and $97 million of  committed acquisition expenses.  Fitch defines liquidity coverage as liquidity sources divided by uses. Sources  of liquidity include unrestricted cash pro forma, availability from the  unsecured revolving credit facility, and projected retained cash flows from  operating activities after dividends and distributions. Uses of liquidity  include debt maturities and projected recurring capital expenditures. The company has excellent contingent liquidity from a large unencumbered  self-storage property pool. Fitch estimates that approximately 98% of the  company's $12.8 billion operating real estate portfolio was unencumbered at Dec.  31, 2014. The company had only $11 million of unsecured borrowings under its  revolver outstanding at June 30, 2015.  Strong Fundamentals Aided by Low Supply Growth Fitch expects PSA's same-store NOI growth to remain solidly positive through  2017. Conservatively, same-store NOI growth should taper off but remain in the  positive mid-single-digits during the forecast period. Mid-single digit rental  rates for new and renewal leases will drive the majority of the gains. Fitch  expects occupancies to remain flat and has conservatively assumed that expenses  grow by approximately 2% per year, similar to its 1.9% expense growth in 2014. PSA's U.S. portfolio same-store NOI grew by 8.7% year-to-date through June 30,  2015, based on a 6.4% increase in revenues and 1.1% expense growth. Low levels  of new supply for the self-storage industry are supporting PSA's operating  fundamentals.  The company's realized annual rent per occupied square foot in its U.S.  same-store portfolio grew by 5.9% to $15.33 during the first six months of the  year from $14.48 during the comparable 2014 period. Weighted average occupancy  was 95.7% at June 30, 2015 - up 60 basis points (bps) year-over-year. PSA's internal growth has slightly lagged its public REIT peers during the last  five years. The company has averaged 5.9% same-store NOI growth vs. 6.9% growth  for the sector during the last five calendar years. PSA's peers have generally  benefited from larger occupancy gains stemming from a greater amount of vacant  space at the trough of the last cycle. Indeed, PSA's occupancy has averaged a  540-bp premium to the sector during the last five years, but the spread has  compressed from 6.7% in 2010 to 3.2% in 2014. Moderate Geographic Portfolio Concentration Risk The company has moderate portfolio concentration within certain U.S. regions,  including Southern California at 12% of rentable square feet, Texas at 12% and  Florida at 12%. While not anticipated by Fitch, reduced economic activity and an  increase in price-sensitive customers in geographic regions in which PSA is  concentrated could reduce overall earnings power. Stable Outlook The Stable Outlook reflects the company's specialty focus coupled with Fitch's  view that FCC will sustain in the mid-6x range over the rating horizon. The  Stable Outlook also reflects that the size of the unencumbered portfolio is also  not likely to change materially. Preferred Stock Notching The one-notch difference between the company's IDR and preferred stock rating  reflects that unlike the majority of preferred stock issuers in the REIT  industry (which have a two-notch difference between their IDRs and preferred  stock ratings), PSA has, and is expected to maintain, limited levels of debt.  Therefore recoveries of preferred stock would likely be stronger than recoveries  of preferred stock of other REITs. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Mid-single digit same-store NOI growth through 2017; --$100 million of acquisitions during the balance of 2015 and $200 million in  2016 and 2017 at going in yields of 6%; --No incremental dispositions during the forecast period; --Development deliveries of $100 million per year through 2017; --Development spending of $100 million during the remainder of 2015 and $150  million in 2016 and 2017; --Repayment of the company's $125 million, 6.5% series P preferred stock in  early October, and no additional preferred refinancings during the remainder of  the forecast period; --$200 million of term loan borrowings in 4Q'15 at a fixed rate of 2.5%; --G&A growth of 2% per year; --Dividend growth of 3% per annum.

539,"  March 10 (The following statement was released by the rating agency)Fitch Ratings has upgraded the Issuer Default Rating  (IDR) of PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE: PHM) to 'BB+' from 'BB'.  The Rating Outlook is  Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows this release.KEY RATING DRIVERS The upgrade of the IDR reflects PHM's solid operating performance in 2013 and  current financial ratios which compare well with those of its peers, substantial  liquidity position and favorable prospects for the housing sector in 2014 and  2015.  Fitch believes that the housing recovery is firmly in place (although the  rate of recovery remains well below historical levels and the upturn will likely  continue to occur in fits and starts).The rating for PHM also reflects the company's broad geographic and product  diversity, a long track record of adhering to a disciplined financial strategy  and, somewhat more recently, an at times, aggressive growth strategy.  The  merger with Centex in August 2009 further enhanced the company's broad  geographic and product line diversity.  Centex's significant presence in the  first move-up and especially in the entry-level categories complements PHM's  strength in both the move-up and active adult segment.  PHM's Del Webb (active  adult) segment is perhaps the best recognized brand name in the homebuilding  business. The company also did a good job in reducing its inventory and  generating positive operating cash flow during the severe housing downturn from  2007 through 2011 and since then.  The Stable Outlook takes into account the  solid housing outlook for 2014 and 2015.PHM's future ratings and Outlook will be influenced by broad housing market  trends as well as company-specific activity such as land and development  spending, general inventory levels, speculative inventory activity (including  the impact of high cancellation rates on such activity), gross and net new-order  activity, debt levels and free cash flow trends and uses.DEBT AND LIQUIDITY The ratings upgrade also takes into account the company's successful execution  of its debt repayment strategy following the merger with Centex in August 2009  and more recently.  Subsequent to the merger the company repurchased $1.5  billion of senior notes through a tender offer.  PHM also retired $898.5 million  in debt in 2010, $323.9 million in 2011, $592.4 million in 2012 and $461.4  million in 2013. On Feb. 21, 2014, the company announced the redemption of the  $95.6 million outstanding 5.20% unsecured senior notes due February 2015 and the  redemption of $150 million outstanding 7.375% unsecured senior notes due June  2046.  The redemptions will occur on March 26, 2014.  The company's remaining  debt maturities are well laddered with $238 million scheduled to mature in 2015  and $465.2 million due in 2016.The reduced debt and growing profitability have enabled the company to improve  its debt/EBITDA ratio from 14.3x at the end of 2010 to 2.3x at the conclusion of  2013.  During that same period, interest coverage improved to 5.7x from 0.9x. PHM ended the December 2013 quarter with $1.58 billion of unrestricted cash and  equivalents and $2.06 billion of senior notes.As a cost saving measure and to provide increased operational flexibility, PHM  voluntarily terminated its $250 million unsecured revolving credit facility  effective March 30, 2011.  Fitch anticipates that PHM will re-establish a credit  facility over the next 12-18 months.As is the case with other public homebuilders, PHM is using the liquidity  accumulated over the past few years to expand its land position and trying to  opportunistically acquire land at attractive prices.In late July 2013 the board of directors reinstituted a quarterly dividend  ($0.05 per share).  The board had eliminated the $0.04 per share quarterly  dividend in November 2008 to conserve cash.  During 2013, PHM repurchased  $127.66 million of its common stock; $234.3 million remains under the current  share repurchase authorization. Even with substantial land and development spending in 2014 as well as some  moderate share repurchase activity and about $51 million paid out in dividends,  Fitch expects PHM will end the year with a cash position between $900 million  and $1.4 billion.MARGIN ENHANCEMENT AND COST-REDUCTION EFFORT PHM has realized considerable improvement in gross profit margins, before real  estate charges, from 8.7% in 2009 to 20.4% in 2013 and on-going operational  initiatives which are expected to at least maintain and potentially generate  further margin expansion.  Those initiatives include a rising share of closings  from the implementation of common plans to help drive construction efficiency,  favorable product mix benefiting from move-up and active adult closings, pushing  design, engineering and purchasing activities out to field operations to drive  local costs lower, and working to ensure proper balance of dirt vs. lower margin  speculative sales (currently 76.4% pre-sold, 23.6% spec).REAL ESTATE As of Dec. 31, 2013, PHM controlled 123,478 lots, of which 77.1% are owned and  the remaining 22.9% are controlled through options. Total lots controlled  represent an approximately seven-year supply of total lots based on LTM closings  and the company owns 5.4 years of lots. The company's land position has  historically been longer compared to other public homebuilders due to its Del  Webb operations. PHM's active adult and certain master-planned communities can  extend from five to seven years or longer during their build-out.During the past few years, the company has been relatively subdued in committing  to incremental land purchases because of its already sizeable land position. Of  course, the acquisition of Centex in 2009 allowed the company to sharply  increase its land position. PHM spent $750 million on land and development in 2009, while Centex spent  roughly $200 million.  PHM spent $980 million on land and development in 2010  and $1.04 billion in 2011.  The company paid out $924 million for land and  development in 2012 - roughly 1/3 for land and 2/3 for development activities.   PHM expended approximately $1.3 billion on real estate in 2013 with roughly 40%  for land and 60% for development.  The preliminary management projection for  spending in 2014 is $2 billion with 45% targeted for land and 55% for  development activities. (For perspective, PHM alone spent $4.6 billion on land  and development in 2006.)PHM continues to have meaningful development expenditures, partially due to its  Del Webb active adult (retiree) operations, but largely related to its Pulte  brand. Currently, fewer developed lots are available to buy; thus, more raw  land, which will require development spending, is being acquired for its Pulte  and Centex brands. This is also the case for other homebuilders.Fitch is comfortable with PHM's land strategy given the company's cash position,  debt maturity schedule, proven access to the capital markets, and management's  demonstrated discipline in pulling back on its land and development activities  during periods of distress. Additionally, Fitch expects management to be  disciplined with the uses of its cash, refraining from significant share  repurchases or one-time dividends to its stockholders that would meaningfully  deplete its liquidity position.THE INDUSTRY Housing metrics showed improvement in 2013. Single-family housing starts grew  15.5%, while new-home sales increased 16.3%. Existing home sales advanced 9.2%  in 2013. The most recent Freddie Mac 30-year interest rate was 4.28%, 97 bps  above the all-time low of 3.31% set the week of Nov. 21, 2012. The NAR's latest  monthly existing home affordability index was 168.1, well below the all-time  high of 213.6, but still meaningfully above the 20-year average.  Housing  metrics should increase in 2014 due to faster economic growth (prompted by  improved household net worth, industrial production and consumer spending), and  consequently, some acceleration in job growth (as unemployment rates decrease to  6.9% for 2014 from an average of 7.5% in 2013), despite somewhat higher interest  rates as well as more measured home price inflation. A combination of tax  increases and spending cuts in 2013 shaved about 1.5pp off annual economic  growth, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Many forecasters expect  the fiscal drag in 2014 to be one-third that amount or less.Fitch's housing estimates for 2014 are as follows: Single-family starts are  forecast to grow almost 20% to 741,000, while multifamily starts expand about 9%  to 333,000; single-family new-home sales should grow approximately 20% to  513,000 as existing home sales advance 2.0% to 5.19 million.  Average  single-family new-home prices (as measured by the Census Bureau), which dropped  1.8% in 2011, increased 8.7% in 2012. Median new-home prices expanded 2.4% in  2011 and grew 7.9% in 2012. Average and median new-home prices improved 9.8% and  8.4%, respectively, in 2013.  New-home price inflation should moderate in 2014,  at least partially because of higher interest rates. Average and median new-home  prices should rise about 3.5% this year. RATING SENSITIVITIES Additional positive rating actions leading to a low investment-grade rating,  although unlikely in the near term, may be considered if the recovery in housing  is maintained and is better than Fitch's current outlook; PHM shows continuous  improvement in credit metrics (particularly debt-to-EBITDA of 2x or lower and  interest coverage in excess of 8.5x and then maintains those metrics); and the  company maintains a substantial liquidity position.A negative rating action could be triggered if the industry recovery dissipates;  PHM's 2014 revenues drop sharply while the EBITDA margins decline below 10%; and  PHM's liquidity position falls sharply, perhaps below $500 million.Fitch has upgraded the following ratings for PHM:PulteGroup, Inc.:--Long-term IDR to 'BB+' from 'BB';--Senior unsecured notes to 'BB+' from 'BB'.Centex Corp.:--Long-term IDR to 'BB+' from 'BB';--Senior unsecured debt to 'BB+' from 'BB'.",2014-03-10,PHM,"Mon Mar 10, 2014 | 8:53am EDT",RPT-Fitch upgrades PulteGroup's IDR to 'BB+'; outlook stable,http://www.reuters.com//article/fitch-upgrades-pultegroups-idr-to-bb-out-idUSFit69268220140310?type=companyNews,0.9976,0.044,0.845,0.111

Horton shares down 10 pct, PulteGroup down 3 pct   (Adds PulteGroup results, executive comments, updates shares)By Ankit AjmeraJuly 24 D.R. Horton Inc, the No.1 U.S. homebuilder, said it had to offer discounts in the third quarter to boost sales in Chicago, a particularly bleak spot in a weak U.S. housing market.D.R. Horton's shares fell more than 10 percent, their largest intra-day percentage fall since 2009, after the company said an impairment charge on its Chicago properties led to a 23 percent slump in profit. ""We (increased) the level of incentives in many communities throughout the spring in an effort to improve sales and maximize returns and profit,"" Chief Financial Officer Bill Wheat said on a conference call.Higher U.S. home prices along with rising mortgage rates in 2014 have reduced affordability for many, resulting in an underwhelming spring selling season, which is to homebuilders what the holiday season is to retailers.A recovery in the overall U.S. housing market has slowed more than expected this year. New home sales dropped 8.1 percent in June, the largest decline in about a year, according to a report from the Commerce Department on Thursday.D.R. Horton said on Thursday that Chicago in particular was performing below its expectations. The company reported a 15 percent drop in home deliveries in the Midwest, including Chicago, and the Southwest in the quarter. Each region accounted for 8 percent of the company's revenue in 2013.Incentives such as lower selling prices reduced D.R. Horton's gross margins to 20.7 percent in the quarter ended June 30 from 21.4 percent a year earlier.In contrast, smaller peer PulteGroup Inc said on Thursday higher prices helped it post a 15 percent rise in profit for the quarter ended June 30. It said gross margins rose to 23.6 percent, from 18.8 percent. D.R. Horton primarily targets first-time buyers, the group considered most sensitive to interest rates. PulteGroup focuses on buyers trading up for the first time, as well as first-time buyers.D.R. Horton's orders - a key indicator for builders, who do not book revenue until they deliver a house - fell 13 percent in the Midwest and 22 percent in the Southwest during the quarter.Its net income of $113.1 million, or 32 cents per share, included a $54.7 million pre-tax impairment charge related to properties in Chicago purchased before the financial crisis.PulteGroup, which also reported a decline in orders, said it had not offered any discounts in the quarter, and didn't intend to do so going forward.""We're definitely running the company for the highest returns on invested capital and we are not pushing discounts,"" said Richard Dugas, Pulte's chief executive.""I can't speak to what competitors are doing.""D.R.

547,"   By Sagarika Jaisinghani  PulteGroup Inc (PHM.N), the No.3 U.S. homebuilder, reported its smallest quarterly increase in home prices in almost two years, joining peers in suggesting that the steep rise in prices in the past couple of years has dampened demand.Shares of PulteGroup, which focuses on first-time home buyers, fell about 2.5 percent in early trading. Growth in the company's average selling price slowed to 8 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from 11 percent a year earlier and 12 percent in the second quarter. ""Builders are faced with rising cost and it's difficult to pass those on because consumers have existing homes as an alternative and so builders can only raise their prices so much,"" said David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.U.S. sales of existing homes rose to a one-year high in September, increasing 2.4 percent to an annual rate of 5.17 million units, data from the National Association of Realtors showed this month. D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N), the largest U.S. homebuilder, said in July that a lackluster recovery in U.S. demand for new homes forced it to offer discounts and other sales incentives.  PulteGroup, however, said on Thursday that it offered 8 percent fewer discounts in the third quarter.""We have not seen significant pressure to increase incentives in the majority of our markets,"" Chief Financial Officer Robert O'Shaughnessy said on a conference call.The company's average selling price rose to $334,000 in the quarter. It reported a 4 percent fall in homes handed over to customers. PulteGroup said it received orders for 3,779 homes, nearly unchanged from a year earlier. The company also said its board had approved a plan to raise its share buyback program by $750 million. ""Our view of the U.S. housing market remains positive, as continued improvements in both the economy and employment provide ongoing support to an industry that continues to benefit from low inventory, low mortgage rates and favorable demographic trends,"" Chief Executive Richard Dugas said in a statement.Home sales revenue, which excludes land sale and financial services revenue, rose 4 percent to $1.55 billion.

548,"  * Third-qtr average selling price rises 8 pct* Reports 4 pct fall in homes closed* Receives orders for 3,779 homes, flat from year earlier* No significant pressure to increase discounts - CFO   (Adds CFO, economist comments; updates shares)By Sagarika JaisinghaniOct 23 PulteGroup Inc, the No.3 U.S. homebuilder, reported its smallest quarterly increase in home prices in almost two years, joining peers in suggesting that the steep rise in prices in the past couple of years has dampened demand.Shares of PulteGroup, which focuses on first-time home buyers, fell about 2.5 percent in early trading.Growth in the company's average selling price slowed to 8 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from 11 percent a year earlier and 12 percent in the second quarter. ""Builders are faced with rising cost and it's difficult to pass those on because consumers have existing homes as an alternative and so builders can only raise their prices so much,"" said David Crowe, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.U.S. sales of existing homes rose to a one-year high in September, increasing 2.4 percent to an annual rate of 5.17 million units, data from the National Association of Realtors showed this month.D.R. Horton Inc, the largest U.S. homebuilder, said in July that a lackluster recovery in U.S. demand for new homes forced it to offer discounts and other sales incentives. PulteGroup, however, said on Thursday that it offered 8 percent fewer discounts in the third quarter.""We have not seen significant pressure to increase incentives in the majority of our markets,"" Chief Financial Officer Robert O'Shaughnessy said on a conference call.The company's average selling price rose to $334,000 in the quarter. It reported a 4 percent fall in homes handed over to customers. PulteGroup said it received orders for 3,779 homes, nearly unchanged from a year earlier.The company also said its board had approved a plan to raise its share buyback program by $750 million. ""Our view of the U.S. housing market remains positive, as continued improvements in both the economy and employment provide ongoing support to an industry that continues to benefit from low inventory, low mortgage rates and favorable demographic trends,"" Chief Executive Richard Dugas said in a statement.Home sales revenue, which excludes land sale and financial services revenue, rose 4 percent to $1.55 billion.Total revenue increased 0.8 percent to $1.59 billion.However, net income plunged about 94 percent to $140.5 million, or 37 cents per share, as the company had a $2.1 billion tax benefit in the year-earlier quarter.PulteGroup's shares were down 0.5 percent at $19.08 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Up to Wednesday's close, the stock had risen about 15 percent in the past 12 months, while the Dow Jones U.S. homebuilding index had gained about 12 percent.

562,"   By Ankit Ajmera  U.S. homebuilder PulteGroup Inc (PHM.N) said Chief Executive Richard Dugas would retire effective May 2017, bowing to a demand from founder and Chairman Emeritus Bill Pulte.Dugas's decision to retire after nearly 13 years at the helm comes as Pulte is seeking a ""different direction"" for the No. 3  U.S. homebuilder by home sales, PulteGroup said.Pulte, however, said the year-long succession plan fell ""far short of the short-term leadership change"" that the company needs. In a letter to shareholders, he reiterated his ""extreme disappointment"" in the leadership of Dugas and asked the board to speed up the succession plan.PulteGroup's shares fell as much as 9.8 percent before closing down 6.6 percent at $17.21.""In an effort to avoid a contested public battle that would not be in the interests of shareholders, Mr. Dugas offered to accelerate and make public the board's succession plan, prompting today's announcement,"" the company said earlier on Monday. PulteGroup, which was the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder until 2014, has been unable to take full advantage of a steady recovery in the nationwide housing market.The housing market in Texas, PulteGroup's biggest market by home closings in 2015, has been affected by a sharp drop in oil prices.The company's home sales have also underperformed those of larger rivals D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N) and Lennar Corp (LEN.N), as labor shortages delayed home closings and rising costs hit margins.

563,"   By Ankit Ajmera  U.S. homebuilder PulteGroup Inc (PHM.N) said Chief Executive Richard Dugas would retire effective May 2017, bowing to a demand from founder and Chairman Emeritus Bill Pulte.Dugas's decision to retire after nearly 13 years at the helm comes as Pulte is seeking a ""different direction"" for the No. 3  U.S. homebuilder by home sales, PulteGroup said.Pulte, however, said the year-long succession plan fell ""far short of the short-term leadership change"" that the company needs. In a letter to shareholders, he reiterated his ""extreme disappointment"" in the leadership of Dugas and asked the board to speed up the succession plan.PulteGroup's shares fell as much as 9.8 percent before closing down 6.6 percent at $17.21.""In an effort to avoid a contested public battle that would not be in the interests of shareholders, Mr. Dugas offered to accelerate and make public the board's succession plan, prompting today's announcement,"" the company said earlier on Monday. PulteGroup, which was the No. 2 U.S. homebuilder until 2014, has been unable to take full advantage of a steady recovery in the nationwide housing market.The housing market in Texas, PulteGroup's biggest market by home closings in 2015, has been affected by a sharp drop in oil prices.The company's home sales have also underperformed those of larger rivals D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N) and Lennar Corp (LEN.N), as labor shortages delayed home closings and rising costs hit margins.

572,"   By Laila Kearney | NEW YORK, April 18  NEW YORK, April 18 Investors may be warming to homebuilder PulteGroup, even though the company has been underperforming its Wall Street peers and its namesake founder is locked in battle with the company's chief executive officer and many of its directors.With shares down more than 15 percent over the past year, dwarfing the 1.4 percent decline in the S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index, PulteGroup founder and biggest shareholder William Pulte is pushing the board to quickly oust CEO Richard Dugas, who recently announced plans to retire in May 2017.Pulte, who owns 8.97 percent of the company's shares, and joined by his grandson Bill Pulte, has faulted Dugas for a leadership style and strategy that he said has led the company's stock to sharply underperform its competitors.But some analysts and investors see opportunity. Short interest in the stock is down, and the company has done slightly better than its peers on Wall Street this year.""We think this reflects investors' excitement at a potential pivot to growth,"" Deutsche Bank said in a research report published Friday that pointed to a recent uptick in orders and construction of new communities.PulteGroup's annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for May 4, but the Pulte family is not expecting a quick resolution to the call for change at the top. The company's board members, most of whom were appointed by Dugas, are expected to be reelected at the meeting and continue to clash with the founder's vision for the company, Bill Pulte said.""This is just the beginning of what unfortunately seems like a long process,"" he said.In the meantime, the decline in the stock has bumped Pulte's dividend up to an attractive 1.93 percent yield and positioned the company, typically premium priced compared to competitors such as Lennar Corporation and D.R. Horton Inc., as a cheap buy. Pulte stock is now selling at roughly 11 times expected earnings for the next 12 months, compared with its typical forward PE of almost 16. ""PHM now trades at a discount to these same large-cap peers, which we believe more than sufficiently discounts any management-related uncertainty,"" Barclays Research said in a note this month. It has upgraded PulteGroup to equal weight from underweight.Short interest in PulteGroup has fallen from a near two-year high of 9.8 percent of outstanding shares at the start of February, to 6.75 percent now, according to Astec Analytics data.On April 4, when Dugas, who was already under pressure from William Pulte, announced his 2017 retirement plans, shares fell as much as 9.8 percent before closing down 6.6 percent. On that day, William Pulte wrote a letter condemning the company's board of directors for failing to immediately push out Dugas.Pulte said Dugas had been overly aggressive with land purchases, lost talented employees who went to work for competitors and spent too much on dividend payouts and share buybacks.PulteGroup has defended Dugas, who has been CEO since 2003, noting that since 2012 he has helped the company boost income, cut debt and - in 2015 - returned $559 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.The public dispute doesn't threaten the company's fundamentals, said Jack Micenko, deputy director of research at Susquehanna Financial Group, who maintains a ""buy"" rating for PulteGroup.""It's a bit of a soap opera,"" he said.

Peshkin is a managing partner at private real estate investment group Vanguard Land LLC, while Scott Powers most recently was the executive vice-president of State Street Corp (STT.N).

Shares of D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N), PulteGroup Inc (PHM.N) and Lennar Corp (LEN.N) rose 2-3 percent.An improving job market as well as mortgage rates that are near historic lows are supporting a bright outlook for the U.S. housing market.New U.S. single-family home sales unexpectedly rose in July, reaching their highest level in nearly nine years as demand increased broadly.Toll on Tuesday reported an 18.2 percent jump in orders - a key metric of future revenue for homebuilders - to 1,748 units for the third quarter, the highest growth in two years.Revenue jumped 23.5 percent to $1.27 billion.""Demand within Toll remains fine, suggesting that the leisure market is holding fine,"" Gabelli & Co analyst Alvaro Lacayo said. D.R. Horton, the largest U.S. homebuilder, reported last month a nearly 10 percent rise in revenue for the April-June quarter, while PulteGroup, the No.3 U.S. homebuilder, reported a 41 percent rise in the same period.Pulte's shares have risen nearly 20 percent since the beginning of the year, while D.R. Horton's stock is trading near a decade-high that it touched last month.PROFIT JUMPS  Horsham, Pennsylvania-based Toll tightened its forecast range for home deliveries for the year ending Oct. 31 and raised the lower end of its average selling price forecast.The company said it expects home deliveries for the year ending Oct. 31 to be 5,900-6,200, compared with its previous range of 5,800-6,300 homes.Average selling price for the fiscal year is expected to be to $840,000-$850,000, compared with Toll's previous forecast of $820,000-$850,000.The homebuilder, which caters to second-home buyers in the United States, lowered its adjusted gross margin forecast for the year. The company, which also develops golf courses and country clubs, expects adjusted gross margin for the year to be 25.6-25.8 percent, compared with its previous range of 25.8-26.2 percent.Toll said it was cutting it full-year gross margin forecast as it expected to deliver a ""few high-margin units"" in its City Living business, which builds high-rises, in fiscal year 2017, instead of fiscal year 2016.City Living accounted for about 8 percent of Toll's annual homebuilding revenue in fiscal 2015.The company's net income nearly doubled to $105.5 million, or 61 cents per share, in the quarter ended July 31 from $66.7 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts on average had expected a profit of 61 cents per share and revenue of $1.25 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Up to Monday's close, shares of Toll had fallen 12 percent this year.

While few U.S. companies have direct exposure to the region, investors had been worried about any fallout from prolonged tensions.""I would be shocked if there was any kind of escalation now, which eliminates some of the concerns people had and forces the market to focus back on the economy, where recent data has been lending credence to the theory that some recent issues were related to weather, not fundamentals,"" said Malcolm Polley, president and chief investment officer of Stewart Capital Advisors in Indiana, Pennsylvania.

614,"   By Rina Chandran  MUMBAI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Clothing companies H&M, Inditex, C&A and PVH have committed to improving the lives of workers in Bengaluru, after a report said employees lived in appalling conditions and were denied decent wages and freedom of movement.Gap Inc., which also sources apparel from Bengaluru, did not respond to the report by the India Committee of the Netherlands (ICN), according to a statement by the Dutch non-governmental group late on Thursday. A draft of the report, Unfree and Unfair, was presented to the companies last November. The conditions of garment workers in South Asia have come under sharp scrutiny following the 2013 Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh, in which 1,135 workers were killed, many of them employed by suppliers to Western retailers. The ICN report said hostels run by the Bengaluru factories lacked basic amenities such as beds and clean water, and that workers earned between 95 euros($104) and 115 euros per month, just above the official minimum wage of 93 euros to 103 euros.Bengaluru, a hub for apparel exporters, is also known as India's Silicon Valley for its numerous information technology companies, and draws migrants seeking better economic prospects from its home Karnataka state, as well as from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and the country's north and east. There are an estimated 1,200 garment factories in and around Bengaluru, making apparel for large global brands. Many of the workers are women from poor backgrounds who do not know the local language and are unaware of their rights, making them more vulnerable to exploitation, according to the report based on interviews with 110 migrant workers at four garment factories in the city.""Global companies have a responsibility to ensure better conditions for the workers, as they are directly benefiting from their labour,"" Raphel Jose, vice president of supply-chain sustainability at the Centre for Responsible Business in Bengaluru, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.  ""This is an area where the brands can come together and collaborate with a local agency and pressurise the industry to improve conditions.""  Dutch clothing retailer C&A, Swedish retailer H&M and Spain's Inditex, which owns the Zara and Massimo Dutti brands, will work together and liaise with local trade unions to provide training and address workers' grievances, ICN said. Inditex will evaluate the state of workers at its suppliers and factories across India, while PVH Corp., which owns brands including Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein, is developing new guidelines for its suppliers, ICN said. ""If the brands commit to these issues and their plan of action, we expect that considerable progress can be made in addressing the working and living conditions of young migrant garment workers in Bangalore,"" ICN said in the statement.

Other companies affected include Sony Corp, which makes image sensors used in iPhones, and electronic parts makers TDK Corp, Alps Electric Co Ltd and Kyocera Corp, the paper reported.LCD panel manufacturers Japan Display Inc, Sharp Corp and LG Display Co Ltd will also be hit by the cut in production, according to the report.Production is expected to return to normal in the April-June quarter, the Nikkei reported. However, Patrick Moorhead, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said he was a bit skeptical about the production cut reports.""Apple has been gaining significant market share in pretty much every region, and I'm not seeing a global slowdown,"" Moorhead said. Apple was not immediately available for comment.The parts suppliers cited in the Nikkei report were not available for comment outside their regular business hours.Tepid forecast by Apple suppliers such as Jabil Circuit , which manufactures casings for iPhones, and Dialog Semiconductor GmbH in December stoked fears that iPhone shipments could fall for the first time.Wall Street has also tempered its view on the high-flying stock in recent months. Since early December, about a third of the analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters have trimmed their estimates on Apple.For fiscal 2016, Apple is expected, on average, to grow revenue by under 4 percent, a far cry from the 28 percent revenue growth it achieved in the fiscal year that ended in September.

Qorvo cut its revenue estimate for the December quarter to about $620 million from $720 million-$730 million, blaming weaker-than-expected demand for its radio-frequency chips used in mobile devices.Analysts on average were expecting $723.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Cirrus, which gets about three-quarters of its revenue from Apple, cut its revenue estimate to about $347 million from $370 million-$400 million.Analysts on average were expecting $385.9 million for the third quarter ended December. Cirrus, which makes audio chips for Apple, said the revenue cut reflected weaker-than-expected demand for certain portable audio products.Shares of other Apple suppliers, including Skyworks Solutions Inc (SWKS.O) and Avago Technologies Ltd (AVGO.O), were also down. Apple shares were down 0.6 percent at $95.87. Apple suppliers' shares have taken a beating ever since reports about slowing iPhone 6S and 6S Plus demand surfaced towards the end of 2015.

Samsung said in a regulatory filing its October-December operating profit would likely be 6.1 trillion won ($5.10 billion), compared with a 6.6 trillion won Thomson Reuters SmartEstimate derived from a survey of 30 analysts. Revenue likely rose 0.5 percent to 53 trillion won, the firm said, without elaborating.""Semiconductor earnings were weak and the smartphone industry entered a phase of low growth,"" KTB Investment analyst Jin Sung-hye said.Even so, Samsung shares were up 1.8 percent as of 0124 GMT, outperforming a 0.1 percent rise for the broader market. ""I think Samsung did well considering the weaker tech demand,"" Jin said.Shares of the world's No.1 maker of memory chips and smartphones touched a three-month low on Thursday as investors braced for downside risks, with some brokerages having tipped profit to have fallen as low as 6 trillion won.The guidance was not a major surprise as Samsung Chief Executive Kwon Oh-hyun had warned on Monday that the maker of Galaxy smartphones faced a challenging time ahead due to weak global economic growth. The tech sector was further rattled on Wednesday when Apple shares fell below $100 for the first time in nearly five months on reports of slowing iPhone 6S and 6S Plus shipments for the January-March quarter.Shares in major component makers were also battered. Investors bailed out of Apple suppliers Cirrus Logic Inc  and Qorvo Inc on Thursday after they cut their revenue estimates for the third quarter.LG Display Co Ltd, the world's top liquid crystal display maker, also warned of tough conditions for the January-March quarter and said the panel industry faced oversupply problems.""Currently there's no visible sign of demand recovery,"" said Avril Wu, research director at market analysis firm DRAMeXchange.Chinese firm Huawei Technologies Co meanwhile said its 2015 smartphone shipments defied the slowdown and jumped 44 percent, underscoring the tough competitive environment for market leaders Samsung and Apple.($1 = 1,196.5400 won)   (Additional reporting by Yeonsoo Kwak and Joyce Lee; Editing by Stephen Coates)",2016-01-08,QRVO,"Thu Jan 7, 2016 | 8:39pm EST",UPDATE 2-Samsung Elec Q4 guidance underscores tech sector headwinds,http://www.reuters.com//article/samsung-elec-results-idUSL3N14R5VP20160108?type=companyNews,-0.3151,0.116,0.78,0.104

633,"   By Ransdell Pierson  The chief executive of Quest Diagnostics Inc (DGX.N) said his company will stick to its core business of diagnostic testing and is not interested in acquiring a contract research organization (CRO), despite such a planned move by rival diagnostics firm LabCorp (LH.N).LabCorp, or Laboratory Corp of America Holdings, said on Monday it would pay $6.1 billion for Covance Inc CVD.N, a leading CRO that conducts trials for drugmakers, as its own diagnostic services business faces pressure from reimbursement cuts. Covance's drug development outsourcing services lessen the need for drugmakers to maintain their own in-house laboratories. By buying Covance, LabCorp would enter the CRO business, while holding on to its existing central labs diagnostics business.Quest, through its own laboratories, offers a wide array of services that range from simple cholesterol tests to genetic tests for risk of breast cancer. Steve Rusckowski, Quest's chief executive, said in an interview on Wednesday that his company is not interested in straying very far from its focus on diagnostic information services.""What we don't have, and we believe is not in the scope of diagnostic information services, is a clinical research organization,"" Rusckowski said. ""We believe the scope we have in diagnostic information services is broad enough and good enough for us to support our growth goals.""Earlier on Wednesday, at an investor day in New York, Quest said it expects average annual sales to grow by 2 percent to 5 percent over the next three years, with acquisitions accounting for one to two percentage points of that growth. It also forecast combined cost savings of $600 million over the same period, thanks largely to standardization of processes, information technology and equipment. For the three-year period, it also predicted growth in earnings per share, excluding special items, of 8 percent to 10 percent on average. Rusckowski said the company, like its rivals, has been hurt in recent years by pricing pressures, including a large reduction in reimbursement by the U.S. Medicare insurance program for pathology tests.But he said pricing pressures appear to be moderating and that increasing numbers of diagnostic tests ordered by doctors could offer ""upside"" for the company in coming years.

634,"  Laboratory testing company Quest Diagnostics Inc said on Tuesday it had signed a $520,000 agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify trends in screening, diagnosis and treatment of four strains of viral hepatitis.Quest will provide the U.S. public health agency with analytics and access to Quest's national database of clinical testing hepatitis data, which includes information from more than 20 billion test results.The agreement expands on Quest's previous efforts with the CDC on hepatitis C testing data for Baby Boomers, or individuals born between 1945 and 1965, one of the groups most exposed to the virus. The government in 2012 recommended that Baby Boomers be screened for hepatitis C, which can cause death. The expanded agreement aims to identify trends in screening for hepatitis A, B, C and E and will focus on data for hepatitis B and C in pregnant women to find possible gaps that the CDC could use to target screening and treatment.The data have been modified to protect the identity of the patients. ""If you can get people diagnosed, then the next obvious stage is to get them into care,"" said Rick Pesano, medical director for infectious diseases at Quest.Treatment for hepatitis C has changed dramatically since Gilead Sciences Inc introduced its Sovaldi drug in December of 2013 with few side effects.

636,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) CHICAGO, March 05 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB' rating to the $1.2  billion bond offering by Quest Diagnostics Inc. (Quest; NYSE: DGX). The Rating  Outlook is Stable. A full list of ratings follows at the end of this release. Fitch expects the bond proceeds, as well as internal liquidity sources, to be  used to repay up to $1,275 million of outstanding debt and associated fees  during 2015, including: --$500 million of 5.45% senior notes due November 2015; --$375 million of 6.4% senior notes due July 2017; --$150 million (50%) of the 3.2% senior notes due April 2016;  --Up to $250 million of a combination of its 6.95% senior notes due 2037 and  5.75% senior notes due 2040. The refinancing will cause reported debt leverage to be temporarily elevated  during 2015. But Fitch expects the aforementioned debt to be repaid and total  debt balances to be reduced to approximately $3.8 billion, with gross  debt/EBITDA between 2.5x and 2.7x, by year-end. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Quest is the largest provider of clinical diagnostic and lab services in the  U.S. Its scale, scope, and customer diversity contributes to relatively stable  operations and margins, albeit facing ongoing pricing and competitive pressures. --Gross debt/EBITDA of 2.7x at Dec. 31, 2014 is expected to remain toward the  upper end of the current 'BBB' ratings and outside Quest's stated long-term  target of 2.25x at least through 2015. --Discretionary cash flows, including FCF of $412 million in 2014, are weaker  than historical measures but still adequate. Recently elevated capital spending  is a more favorable strain on FCF than the heavy shareholder returns of 2013 and  should drive stronger operations going forward.  --The aforementioned refinancing extends most of Quest's near-term debt  maturities and, thereby, reduces refinancing risk. But opportunities for debt  repayment over the next four years will now be limited to temporary A/R facility  borrowings and the $150 million of remaining 3.2% notes due 2016. --The firm's restructuring programs are helping to offset margin pressures from  weak healthcare utilization trends and tightened reimbursement. But EBITDA  margins still showed some compression in 2014, the fifth straight year of  decline. RATING SENSITIVITIES Quest will have limited flexibility at the current 'BBB' ratings for much of  2015. De-leveraging is likely to occur primarily from growing EBITDA, as the  firm has limited opportunities for debt repayment following the contemplated  refinancing. Organic growth will be difficult given industry headwinds, making  EBITDA growth dependent on cost savings and/or M&A funded out of discretionary  cash flows. Negative rating action could stem from sustained weak operating performance,  characterized by minimal volume growth due to continued negative healthcare  utilization trends and tightened government and commercial reimbursement.  Continued EBITDA margin compression and/or incremental debt from leveraging  transactions that results in gross debt leverage maintained above 2.7x would be  more consistent with a 'BBB-' rating. Positive rating action is not likely over the ratings horizon. KEY ASSUMPTIONS --Relatively flat organic revenues, some benefit from acquisitions annualizing  in Q1; --Relatively flat margins from continuing pricing and competitive pressures,  offset by further Invigorate cost savings and improving margins in acquired  businesses; --Operating cash flow in 2015 similar to 2014 measures, with modest increases in  capex and dividend payouts.

639,"  NEW YORK Quest Diagnostics Inc, the world's largest provider of diagnostic testing services, is working with France's national health agency to build an expanded database for BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations to better determine patient hereditary risks of breast and ovarian cancer.Other medical testing companies and public laboratories can participate in the project, called BRCA Share, for which Quest will charge an annual fee in return for access to the curated database, Madison, New Jersey-based Quest said on Tuesday.Laboratory Corporation of America, Quest's biggest U.S. competitor in medical diagnostics testing, has also agreed to participate.Genetic information gathered from DNA testing is not always shared by diagnostics laboratories, which can make it difficult for those with smaller databases to analyze gene mutations. This can result in uncertainty for patients about their cancer risk and appropriate preventative care.The French National Institute of Health and Medical Research collects all BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing information in France through 16 labs that are part of the Unicancer Genetic Group and maintains a database that is the foundation of the project.While other databases exist to share genetic information, differences in terminology and format as well as duplications can make them difficult to use, said Charles Strom, Quest's vice president for genetics and genomics. With the broader pool, Quest will also be able to conduct research studies, he said.Fees for access to the database will run from the tens of thousands of dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars for private laboratories. The number of tests for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations has jumped since Angelina Jolie revealed 18 months ago that she had the mutation associated with breast and ovarian cancer.There are some mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes that are well recognized as raising the risk of breast and ovarian cancer, but there are thousands of other possible mutations in the genes whose significance remains unknown.In the United States, Myriad Genetics Inc has the longest history of BRCA testing as well as the highest volume of tests. It holds over 90 percent of the market for hereditary cancer testing and has cited its database as a competitive advantage. Myriad had held a patent on BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing, but after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it invalid, other laboratories entered the market in 2013.In addition to Quest and LabCorp, Invitae Corp, privately held Ambry Genetics and the University of Washington in Seattle offer BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing.

652,"  (The following statement was released by the rating agency) NEW YORK, May 20 (Fitch) Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of Quest  Diagnostics Inc. (Quest; NYSE: DGX) at 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable. KEY RATING DRIVERS --Quest is the largest independent player in the relatively fragmented and  highly competitive U.S. clinical laboratory market. Such scale affords the  opportunity for comparatively efficient operations and supplies sourcing and the  ability to drive associated margin improvement following M&A. --Quest's focus on operational improvement has helped to drive margin  improvement that has been accompanied by positive organic growth in each fiscal  quarter since fourth-quarter 2014. Fitch expects low single digit organic growth  and further margin expansion in 2016, benefitting from moderating pricing  pressure, cost efficiencies, and favorable business mix driven by strong growth  in Quest's gene-based and esoteric testing business. --Gross debt/EBITDA was 2.7x at March 31, 2016, which remains moderately  elevated relative to Quest's 'BBB' ratings and what Fitch believes to be  management's long-term target of around 2.5x. Fitch expects this metric to  approximate 2.5x by year-end 2016, largely due to earnings growth . Fitch does  not expect the company to prioritize debt repayment in the current low interest  rate environment. --Management has demonstrated its commitment to using discretionary cash to fund  M&A and shareholder-friendly payments over the past few years. The firm has  committed to delivering a majority of its operating cash flows, less capex, to  shareholders going forward and plans to conduct M&A so as to add 1%-2% of sales  per year. KEY ASSUMPTIONS Fitch's key assumptions within the rating case for Quest include: --Top-line growth of between 3%-4% in 2017-2019. Organic top-line growth is  expected to approximate 1.5-2% with the remainder anticipated to come from 1%-2%  of annual growth through M&A.  --Incremental margin expansion is forecast throughout the projection period.  Organic positive top-line growth allows for the leverage of fixed costs, and  additional cost savings from the company's 'Invigorate' restructuring program  are expected to benefit 2016-2019 results.  --Operating cash flow (OCF) and free cash flow (FCF) are expected to total  roughly $1 billion and $400 million, respectively, in 2016, and then grow  roughly in line with EBITDA over the forecast period. --Moderate EBITDA growth on a slightly increasing debt balance (reflecting  expectation that Quest will manage towards a 2.5x gross leverage target) is  expected to result in gross leverage of around 2.5x throughout the forecast  period. RATING SENSITIVITIES Quest's 'BBB' ratings consider gross debt/EBITDA in the range of 2.2x-2.7x, with  evidence of growth and margin stabilization over the forecast period. Fitch  estimates that OCF of $500 million to $600 million will be necessary to fund the  firm's M&A targets (1%-2% of growth) and commitment to return a majority of FCF  to shareholders. Positive rating actions are not likely in the near term, as Fitch expects Quest  to maintain gross leverage at or near 2.5x for the foreseeable future. Over the  longer term, an upgrade to 'BBB+' could be considered if the company committed  to maintaining gross debt/EBITDA at 2.2x or below, accompanied by an outlook for  positive organic growth and margin expansion. Organic growth will be challenged  in the near term by a persistently constrained reimbursement environment, making  meaningful EBITDA growth dependent on cost savings and/or M&A funded with  discretionary cash flows. Negative rating action could stem from a reversion to negative growth and margin  trends coupled with an inability to drive cost savings under the firm's expanded  Invigorate program. Ongoing EBITDA declines and/or debt-funded transactions  contributing to gross debt/EBITDA sustained around 2.7x or above could drive a  downgrade to 'BBB-'. Operating cash flow trending below $500 million without an  adjustment to the firm's dividend or capital spending could also pressure the  ratings. BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS YIELDING BENEFITS Quest ended a five-year streak of organic top-line declines and margin  deterioration in 2015 thanks to a renewed focus on the company's diagnostic  information services business and a commitment to improving operational  efficiencies. Adjusting for exited business, Quest has now reported six  consecutive quarters of organic growth. Fitch forecasts organic sales growth in  2016 to approximate 1.5%. Company organic growth could rejoin overall market  growth of 2%-3% in 2017. Organic top-line growth, coupled with an additional $600 million of cost savings  targeted in 2015-2017, is expected to promote margin expansion over the forecast  period. Fitch expects EBITDA margins to be modestly up in 2016 and 2017, with  greater improvement possible in 2018 and 2019. EBITDA margins are expected to  surpass 20% over the forecast period compared to 19.5% and 18.7% in 2015 and  2014, respectively. Greater improvement is possible but will be challenged by a  constrained reimbursement environment and growth in Quest's professional labs  services (PLS) business, which is lower margin than the company's diagnostic  services business, but is significantly less capital intensive. DEBT REDUCTION IS UNLIKELY Fitch projects that Quest's gross debt leverage will generally approximate 2.5x  over the forecast period and does not expect the company to prioritize debt  repayment in the current low interest rate environment.  Management has demonstrated its commitment to using discretionary cash to fund  M&A and shareholder-friendly payments over the past few years. The firm has  committed to delivering a majority of its operating cash flows, less capex, to  shareholders going forward and plans to conduct M&A so as to add 1%-2% of sales  per year. On May 18, 2016, Quest announced that it would use the cash proceeds  from the sale of its Focus products business to repurchase shares. Fitch expects  near-term acquisition activity to be targeted in nature and financed with cash  on hand and/or temporary draws on the company's A/R facility. Without material opportunities for debt repayment over the next four years,  deleveraging will be highly dependent on EBITDA growth.  PAMA PRESENTS CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES  Under the federal Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA), it is  expected that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will revise  reimbursement schedules for clinical laboratory testing services provided under  Medicare. Among other provisions, PAMA allows CMS to create a market-based  payment system to rebase the clinical laboratory fee schedule as early as 2017,  although delays in the rule making progress appear likely to delay its  implementation. Under the law, 'applicable laboratories' are required to report to CMS the rates  they receive from private payors for each clinical diagnostic lab test. After  collecting this information, CMS will calculate a weighted median payment amount  for each test. An 'applicable laboratory' is defined as a lab that receives more than 50  percent of its Medicare revenues Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule  (MCLFS) and the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS). As drafted, PAMA  therefore would not require hospital labs to report fees. Because hospital labs  typically receive higher commercial rates than independent labs, their exclusion  from CMS' market rate calculation could result in revisions to the MCLFS and  MPFS that are lower than actual overall market rates. While lower Medicare reimbursement rates would pressure Quest and other  independent labs, Quest may be in a better position than many of its smaller  competitors to absorb its impact and could actually benefit from PAMA's  implementation. In 2015, only 12% of the company's consolidated net revenues  were reimbursed by Medicare under the CLFS while 2% were reimbursed by under the  MPFS. Fitch believes many smaller labs may have more concentrated exposure to  Medicare. AMPLE LIQUIDITY Quest had access to an undrawn $750 million revolver, $123 million available  under its $600 million A/R securitization facility, and had cash on hand of $128  million at March 31, 2016 (42% considered permanently reinvested outside the  U.S.). Quest amended and restated its $750 million revolver in April 2014, extending  its maturity to April 2019. In October 2015, the company amended and restated  the agreement for the secured receivables credit facility, increasing the  borrowing capacity under the facility to $600 million from $525 million and  extending the maturity by one year to October 2017. Quest's only remaining bond  maturity before 2020 is $300 million due April 2019. FULL LIST OF RATING ACTIONS Fitch has affirmed Quest's ratings as follows: --Long-term IDR at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured bank facility at 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes at 'BBB'.

Fitch  estimates that OCF of $500 million to $600 million will be necessary to fund the  firm's M&A targets (1%-2% of growth) and commitment to return a majority of FCF  to shareholders. Positive rating actions are not likely in the near term, as Fitch expects Quest  to maintain gross leverage at or near 2.5x for the foreseeable future. Over the  longer term, an upgrade to 'BBB+' could be considered if the company committed  to maintaining gross debt/EBITDA at 2.2x or below, accompanied by an outlook for  positive organic growth and margin expansion. Organic growth will be challenged  in the near term by a persistently constrained reimbursement environment, making  meaningful EBITDA growth dependent on cost savings and/or M&A funded with  discretionary cash flows. Negative rating action could occur with a reversion to negative growth and  margin trends coupled with an inability to drive cost savings under the firm's  expanded Invigorate program. Ongoing EBITDA declines and/or debt-funded  transactions contributing to gross debt/EBITDA sustained at around 2.7x or above  could drive a downgrade to 'BBB-'. Operating cash flow trending below $500  million without an adjustment to the firm's dividend or capital spending could  also pressure the ratings. BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS YIELDING BENEFITS Quest ended a five-year streak of organic top-line declines and margin  deterioration in 2015 thanks to a renewed focus on the company's diagnostic  information services business and a commitment to improving operational  efficiencies. Adjusting for exited business, Quest has now reported six  consecutive quarters of organic growth. Fitch forecasts organic sales growth in  2016 to approximate 1.5%. Company organic growth could rejoin overall market  growth of 2%-3% in 2017. Organic top-line growth, coupled with an additional $600 million of cost savings  targeted in 2015-2017, is expected to promote margin expansion over the forecast  period. Fitch expects EBITDA margins to be modestly up in 2016 and 2017, with  greater improvement possible in 2018 and 2019. EBITDA margins are expected to  surpass 20% over the forecast period compared to 19.5% and 18.7% in 2015 and  2014, respectively. Greater improvement is possible but will be challenged by a  constrained reimbursement environment and growth in Quest's professional labs  services (PLS) business, which is lower margin than the company's diagnostic  services business, but is significantly less capital-intensive. DEBT REDUCTION IS UNLIKELY Fitch projects Quest's gross debt leverage will generally approximate 2.5x over  the forecast period and does not expect the company to prioritize debt repayment  in the current low interest rate environment.  Management has demonstrated its commitment to using discretionary cash to fund  M&A and shareholder-friendly payments over the past few years. The firm has  committed to delivering a majority of its operating cash flows, less capex, to  shareholders going forward and plans to conduct M&A so as to add 1%-2% of sales  per year. On May 18, 2016, Quest announced that it would use the cash proceeds  from the sale of its Focus products business to repurchase shares. Fitch expects  near-term acquisition activity to be targeted in nature and financed with cash  on hand and/or temporary draws on the company's A/R facility. Without material opportunities for debt repayment over the next four years,  deleveraging will be highly dependent on EBITDA growth.  PAMA PRESENTS CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES  Under the federal Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA), it is  expected that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will revise  reimbursement schedules for clinical laboratory testing services provided under  Medicare. Among other provisions, PAMA allows CMS to create a market-based  payment system to re-base the clinical laboratory fee schedule as early as 2017,  although delays in the rulemaking process appear likely to delay its  implementation. Under the law, 'applicable laboratories' are required to report to CMS the rates  they receive from private payors for each clinical diagnostic lab test. After  collecting this information, CMS will calculate a weighted median payment amount  for each test. An 'applicable laboratory' is defined as a lab that receives more than 50% of  its Medicare revenues from the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (MCLFS)  or the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS). As drafted, PAMA therefore would  not require hospital labs to report fees. Because hospital labs typically  receive higher commercial rates than independent labs, their exclusion from CMS'  market rate calculation could result in revisions to the MCLFS and MPFS that are  lower than actual overall market rates. While lower Medicare reimbursement rates would pressure Quest and other  independent labs, Quest may be in a better position to absorb its impact than  many of its smaller competitors and could actually benefit from PAMA's  implementation. In 2015, only 12% of the company's consolidated net revenues  were reimbursed by Medicare under the CLFS while 2% was reimbursed under the  MPFS. Fitch believes that many smaller labs may have more concentrated exposure  to Medicare. AMPLE LIQUIDITY Quest had access to an undrawn $750 million revolver, $123 million available  under its $600 million A/R securitization facility, and had cash on hand of $128  million at March 31, 2016 (42% considered permanently reinvested outside the  U.S.). Quest amended and restated its $750 million revolver in April 2014, extending  its maturity to April 2019. In October 2015, the company amended and restated  the agreement for the secured receivables credit facility, increasing the  borrowing capacity under the facility to $600 million from $525 million and  extending the maturity by one year to October 2017. Quest's only remaining bond  maturity before 2020 is $300 million due April 2019. Fitch rates Quest as follows: --Long-Term IDR 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured bank facility 'BBB'; --Senior unsecured notes 'BBB'. The Rating Outlook is Stable.

672,"   By Anet Josline Pinto and Mike Stone  Range Resources Corp (RRC.N) said on Monday it will buy fellow natural gas producer Memorial Resource Development Corp MRD.O for about $3.3 billion in stock, at a time of almost no mergers and a rising tide of bankruptcies in the energy sector.The deal combines Range's prime natural gas resources in Appalachia with Memorial's assets in Louisiana, which has ample pipeline connections to the U.S. Gulf Coast and its growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants.Hefty debt loads and disagreements over valuations between buyers and sellers have stymied scores of potential mergers since oil and gas prices tumbled in mid-2014, but this deal was reached thanks to Memorial's light debt load and strong hedge book that allows it to sell gas at above spot market prices.The deal will markedly add to Range's cash-flows and improve its bottom line, while improving its credit profile.""In contrast to significant dilutive asset sales or equity dilution, this merger looks like an inventive solution,"" analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said in a note to clients.A person familiar with the matter said the deal does not mean a largely frozen M&A market has thawed and that there will soon be a flurry of transactions. ""This is a one-off,"" said the person, who compared it to the last notable merger in the U.S. fracking industry - Noble Energy's (NBL.N) purchase of Rosetta Resources one year ago.With U.S. benchmark natural gas prices NGc1 plumbing near-record lows of $2 per million BTU, companies are under pressure to slash expenses and be creative.Jeff Ventura, Range's CEO, said the combined company will be able to sell gas into cold Northern U.S. markets in the winter, and supply power plants in the Southern United States and export platforms along the Gulf Coast.""(This is) an operationally led transaction that really makes us a better, stronger company but it also helps significantly with the balance sheet,"" he said. Under the terms of the deal, Memorial Resource Development's shareholders will receive 0.375 of a Range Resources share for each share they hold.The all-stock deal is valued at $15.75 per share, a 17 percent premium to Memorial Resource Development's Friday close.

673,"   By Anet Josline Pinto and Mike Stone  Range Resources Corp (RRC.N) said on Monday it will buy fellow natural gas producer Memorial Resource Development Corp MRD.O for about $3.3 billion in stock, at a time of almost no mergers and a rising tide of bankruptcies in the energy sector.The deal combines Range's prime natural gas resources in Appalachia with Memorial's assets in Louisiana, which has ample pipeline connections to the U.S. Gulf Coast and its growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants.Hefty debt loads and disagreements over valuations between buyers and sellers have stymied scores of potential mergers since oil and gas prices tumbled in mid-2014, but this deal was reached thanks to Memorial's light debt load and strong hedge book that allows it to sell gas at above spot market prices.The deal will markedly add to Range's cash-flows and improve its bottom line, while improving its credit profile.""In contrast to significant dilutive asset sales or equity dilution, this merger looks like an inventive solution,"" analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein said in a note to clients.A person familiar with the matter said the deal does not mean a largely frozen M&A market has thawed and that there will soon be a flurry of transactions. ""This is a one-off,"" said the person, who compared it to the last notable merger in the U.S. fracking industry - Noble Energy's (NBL.N) purchase of Rosetta Resources one year ago.With U.S. benchmark natural gas prices NGc1 plumbing near-record lows of $2 per million BTU, companies are under pressure to slash expenses and be creative.Jeff Ventura, Range's CEO, said the combined company will be able to sell gas into cold Northern U.S. markets in the winter, and supply power plants in the Southern United States and export platforms along the Gulf Coast.""(This is) an operationally led transaction that really makes us a better, stronger company but it also helps significantly with the balance sheet,"" he said. Under the terms of the deal, Memorial Resource Development's shareholders will receive 0.375 of a Range Resources share for each share they hold.The all-stock deal is valued at $15.75 per share, a 17 percent premium to Memorial Resource Development's Friday close.

686,"  By Andrea Shalal-EsaWASHINGTON Jan 24 The U.S. Navy on Friday said it was sticking with Raytheon Co as prime contractor for next-generation radar-jamming technology seen valued at billions of dollars in coming years, despite a November ruling by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) that upheld a protest against the award.Raytheon in July beat out BAE Systems and a team comprised of Northrop Grumman Corp and Exelis Inc  to win the Navy contract for the jamming system.  The GAO in November backed a BAE challenge of the contract, which was initially valued at $279 million but could be worth many multiples of that over coming decades, according to analysts""The Navy has completed corrective action as recommended by the GAO in the sustained protest filed by BAE Systems on the Next Generation Jammer Technology Development contract,"" said Navy spokeswoman Commander Thurraya Kent.She said the Navy decided to stick with the Raytheon offer after carrying out a new cost and technical analysis of all three original bids, but gave no additional details. The new jammer will replace the Northrop-built ALQ-99 tactical jamming system now used on the EA-18G Growler aircraft built by Boeing Co. The jamming pods will enable U.S. aircraft to render enemy radars useless.""This confirms a huge breakthrough for Raytheon that potentially could generate over $10 billion in additional revenue during the next several decades,"" said Loren Thompson, chief operating officer of the Lexington Institute think tank.Thompson said he expected the program to survive the current difficult budget environment given the U.S. military's need in wartime to prevent adversaries from tracking aircraft, communicating with ground forces or remotely detonating bombs. It was not immediately clear if BAE or Northrop would protest the Navy's decision to keep Raytheon on the contract.No immediate comment was available from Raytheon. BAE spokeswoman Kristin Gossel said her company was weighing its options.""We protested the award based on concerns with the Navy's evaluation of our offering and our protest was sustained by the GAO. We are disappointed with today's decision and are currently considering all of our options,"" Gossel said.Northrop, which had not protested the Navy's award to Raytheon, said it was also disappointed by the decision.""While we are disappointed, we remain committed to continue to provide our warfighters with the lowest risk, most affordable solutions,"" said Northrop spokesman Randy Belote.When the GAO, the congressional agency that oversees federal contract protests, ruled in favor of BAE in November, it said the Navy had failed to reasonably evaluate the risk of the proposals, improperly credited Raytheon with outdated performance data, and did not adequately document its decision.",2014-01-24,RTN,"Fri Jan 24, 2014 | 4:32pm EST",UPDATE 2-Raytheon to keep next-generation jammer contract -U.S. Navy,http://www.reuters.com//article/raytheon-navy-idUSL2N0KY1HW20140124?type=companyNews,-0.9582,0.115,0.804,0.081

688,"  By Andrea Shalal-EsaWASHINGTON Jan 30 U.S. arms maker Raytheon Co  reported higher-than-expected earnings in the fourth quarter on Thursday, although revenues fell short of estimates with U.S. military spending in decline.The company expected sales to drop further in 2014, but it said operating margins, international sales and profits would remain strong, buoyed partly by a sharp rise in pension income.Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Dave Wajsgras said the low point or ""bottom"" of U.S. military spending was likely from mid-2013 to mid-2014, echoing similar projections from top executives at Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, which reported earnings last week.He said a two-year budget agreement reached by Congress last year would help the U.S. government and arms makers plan better for the coming year.Raytheon said revenues were expected to drop to $22.5 billion to $23 billion in 2014 after falling 2.9 percent to $23.7 billion in 2013.Earnings from continuing operations were expected to rise to $6.74 to $6.89 per share, from $5.96 in 2013, boosted by a sharp rise in income from pension investments. Excluding pensions, earnings per share were likely to drop to $5.76 to $5.91 per share from $6.38 in 2013, the company said.Wajsgras told Reuters the company's bookings exceeded sales by 28 percent in the fourth quarter, and that trend was likely to continue in the first half of 2014, with sales likely to show stronger growth in the second half. Raytheon now expects to finalize a large order from Kuwait for a Patriot missile defense system in February, a deal valued at $500 million to $600 million that had been expected in the fourth quarter, Wajsgras said.In early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Raytheon shares were 25 cents higher, at $88.88.STRONG BALANCE SHEET  Chief Executive William Swanson, who will hand over the reins to Chief Operating Officer Tom Kennedy at the end of March, said Raytheon also expected to finalize a Patriot order valued at over $2 billion with Qatar in the first half of 2014.He told analysts international bookings would account for 35 percent to 40 percent of total orders in 2014, down from 43 percent in 2013, while foreign sales would account for about 30 percent of total sales, up slightly from 29 percent in 2013.Swanson said sales were expected to remain strong in the Middle East and Asia, but there could also be new orders from Europe and Australia in two or three years.Wajsgras said the company's adjusted operating margin in 2013 was 13.4 pct, the highest level seen since 2000, which reflected efforts to cut costs by consolidating facilities and other measures. He said margins would likely ease to 12.6-12.8 percent in 2014 as the company began work on several new programs, which typically carry lower margins to start. Wajsgras said strong 2013 margins were a highlight of the year. ""That bodes well for our customers because it reflects our ability to continue to take costs out,"" he said.Swanson said Raytheon's strong balance sheet put it in a good position for possible acquisitions of low- and mid-tier companies that are being squeezed by cuts in military spending. But he said the company was not looking to simply buy revenue.""Just to buy something for revenue sake, that never works,"" Swanson said. ""But where it fits in, especially where we see future growth, then that would be the case.""Raytheon reported nearly flat net profit from continuing operations of $467 million, while earnings per share from continuing operations rose to $1.46 from $1.41 a year earlier.

692,"  WASHINGTON Feb 25 The Pentagon's next budget will include funds to overhaul Boeing Co's ground-based missile defense system and develop a replacement for an interceptor built by Raytheon Co after several recent test failures, the Pentagon's chief weapons buyer said Tuesday.""We've got to get to more reliable systems,"" Frank Kendall, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, told a conference sponsored by McAleese and Associations and Credit Suisse.Asked if the problems were linked to a shortage of funding in recent years, Kendall said he attributed the issues more to decisions to rush deployment of technologies that had not been completely and thoroughly tested.""Just updating the things we've got is probably not going to be adequate. So we're going to have to go beyond that,"" he said, although he gave no details.Reuters reported earlier this month that the Pentagon planned to ask Congress for $4.5 billion in additional funding for missile defense over the next five years, including $560 million for work on a new interceptor after several failed flight tests. The White House plans to send its fiscal 2015 budget request to Congress on March 4.Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel previewed the Pentagon's portion of the budget on Monday but did not provide specific details about missile defense.

Boeing confirmed that the announcement included a contract to buy 24 AH-64E Apache attack helicopters and three Boeing 737 Airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft.The deal for the helicopters was valued at 8.9 billion riyals, said the spokeswoman for the conference.In Paris, France's Defense Ministry said Qatar had agreed to buy 22 NH90 military helicopters from a unit of European aerospace group Airbus worth 2 billion euros ($2.76 billion) and two Airbus-made refueling tankers. NHIndustries is 62.5 percent owned by Airbus' Eurocopter helicopter unit, 32 percent owned by AgustaWestland, a unit of Italy Finmeccanica's and 5.5 percent by Stork Fokker.Qatar also committed to buy a Patriot missile defense system built by Raytheon equipped with PAC-3 missiles made by Lockheed; advanced daytime, high-definition sensors and radars for Apache helicopters; and Javelin missiles built by a Lockheed-Raytheon joint venture, according to sources familiar with the matter.Raytheon had told analysts in January that it expected to finalize an order with Qatar in the first half of 2014 for over $2 billion in Patriot missile defense system equipment.The Pentagon approved the sale to Qatar of $9.9 billion worth of Patriot fire units, radars, and various Raytheon and Lockheed missiles in November 2012. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, the U.S. body which oversees foreign arms sales, had notified lawmakers in July 2012 of a possible sale of Apache helicopters to Qatar.A spokeswoman for the U.S. agency had no immediate comment.Washington has been keen to deepen its cooperation with Gulf nations, which have been long-standing allies, on missile defense and increase pressure on Iran over its nuclear program.The Apache helicopters are built by Boeing and used by the U.S. Army, Egypt, Greece, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Netherlands, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates, and United Kingdom.They will be fitted with Longbow radar equipment made by a joint venture of Lockheed and Northrop Grumman Corp.($1 = 3.6415 Qatar Riyals)   (Additional reporting by Marine Pennetier in Paris and Andrea Shalal in Washington, Editing by William Maclean, Elaine Hardcastle and Tom Brown)",2014-03-27,RTN,"Thu Mar 27, 2014 | 4:08pm EDT","UPDATE 2-Qatar buys helicopters, missiles in $23 bln arms deals",http://www.reuters.com//article/qatar-defence-idUSL5N0MO3VV20140327?type=companyNews,0.9607,0.057,0.83,0.113
705,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON An unmanned U.S. Navy helicopter built by Northrop Grumman Corp and a precision ship-landing system built by Raytheon Co face mandatory reviews that could lead to their cancellation after quantity reductions drove unit costs sharply higher in 2013, the Pentagon announced on Thursday.Senior defense officials said the cost increases were largely due to cuts in the numbers of items to be purchased, but federal law required a careful look at program performance and other factors.The Nunn-McCurdy law requires a mandatory, 60-day live-or-die review if weapons systems see an increase of more than 25 percent in their unit costs.

708,"  (Adds CEO comments from earnings call, updates stock price)By Andrea ShalalApril 24 U.S. weapons maker Raytheon Co  reported higher first-quarter profit on Thursday after a tax credit and favorable pension adjustments and forecast strong bookings and a slight gain in margins for the rest of the year.But the company, which makes missiles and other military equipment, did not change its full-year forecast, which drove down shares more than 4 percent. Other defense stocks were more modestly lower.Raytheon said net income attributable to shareholders rose to $596 million, or $1.89 per share, from $488 million, or $1.49 a share, a year earlier. Excluding the tax and pension impact, earnings dropped to $1.43 per share from $1.56.Raytheon Chief Financial Officer David Wajsgras told Reuters the company expected strong bookings and improved operating margins for the rest of this year after posting the highest quarterly earnings per share and cash flow in over a decade.Cash flow reached $659 million in the first quarter, up from $422 million a year earlier. The company expects full-year cash flow to reach $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion. Wajsgras said the company's international demand remained strong, and that foreign orders would account for nearly 30 percent of revenues and nearly 40 percent of bookings in 2014.Revenues fell 6.3 percent to $5.5 billion in the first quarter, a reflection of U.S. budget cuts, but Raytheon programs fared well in the 2015 U.S. budget proposal, Wajsgras said.Sales and operating income were down at three of Raytheon's four business divisions. Operating profit at its information and services unit rose 1 percent despite a 5 percent drop in sales. The company still expected revenue to reach $22.5 billion to $23 billion for the full year, with earnings of $6.74 to $6.89 per share, or $5.76 to $5.91, excluding special items.Wajsgras said first-quarter bookings rose to $4.3 billion from $3.6 billion a year earlier due to a missile defense order from Kuwait and a cybersecurity order from an unnamed country. Bookings would likely top $7 billion in the second quarter.The company expected a slight improvement in operating margin over the course of the year, after the measure reached 14.3 percent in the first quarter, he said. Raytheon reported an operating margin of 12.4 percent for the 2013 year, up 20 basis points from the previous year.Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kennedy told analysts the company viewed acquisitions as a critical part of its long-term growth strategy, with a particular eye to expanding international and commercial sales in the cyber security area.Kennedy said tensions between Russia and Ukraine have boosted demand for Raytheon's products in eastern Europe, and should firm up Poland's plans for a competition over a missile defense contract.Byron Callan, an analyst with Capital Alpha Securities, said Raytheon's results were largely in line with those of other defense companies, adding that the stock drop was likely because it did not increase its full-year earnings forecast.Raytheon shares fell 4.5 percent to $95.73 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange.

715,"  * Pentagon chief Hagel visits Mideast ally next week* Israel says austerity drive hurts combat readinessBy Dan WilliamsJERUSALEM, May 9 Budget-strapped Israel is pressing the United States to conclude a deal extending defence aid beyond 2017, when Washington's current $3 billion annual payouts to its Middle East ally expire, officials said on Friday.They said a swift agreement on future U.S. grants would help Israel's military draft a five-year austerity plan accommodating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative government.""It's difficult to budget into 2018 and 2019 without knowing what funds will be available,"" an Israeli defence official said.U.S. Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel will visit Israel next week and the future aid will probably be raised by his hosts, according to a different official who declined to be identified by name or nationality. The previous Republican administration signed a 10-year deal with Israel in 2007 granting it $30 billion, most of it going on American defence products.U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, has sparred with Netanyahu over Iran's nuclear programme and peacemaking with the Palestinians. But support for Israel's security remains strong in Washington - even as policymakers there slash spending on a range of U.S. military programmes.""Our two nations are forever bound by our shared history and our shared values, and every American dollar spent on Israel's security is an investment in protecting the many interests that our nations share,"" U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice said on Friday, concluding three days of consultations in Israel.Israel's Defence Ministry and the U.S. embassy in Israel declined comment on the aid negotiations, which are under way. INCREASED FUNDING SOUGHT A U.S. official briefed on the talks and who spoke on condition of anonymity said Israel was seeking an overall increase to between $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion a year, while the Obama administration had spoken of $2.8 billion. The allies would probably settle on $3 billion ""or thereabouts,"" the official predicted, adding that Israel ""wants to get this worked out as soon as possible"".Israel's defence budget of around $14.5 billion has been challenged by Finance Ministry demands to cut $870 million. Netanyahu's security cabinet in December separately approved a $930 million boost to the defence budget, but the military says it needs more to contend with proliferating regional threats.""We cannot bridge this budget rift,"" Defence Minister Moshe Yaalon told Israeli lawmakers on Wednesday. ""There has been a mortal blow to training, to readiness and to fitness.""A senior Israeli military officer said the belt-tightening had put the brakes on David's Sling, a missile interceptor  developed jointly with U.S. firm Raytheon Co. and which is being considered for purchase by Poland as it accelerates its defence preparations in response to the Ukraine-Russia standoff.David's Sling could be operational in Israel in a year, the officer told reporters on Thursday - but only if more funds were found. ""The moment you don't have the money, you pull back on the development and on getting the kit in the field,"" he said.In addition to the annual defence grants, Washington has separately helped bankroll Iron Dome, a shorter-range Israeli rocket interceptor system already deployed. Rice put the amount of U.S. funds earmarked for Iron Dome at nearly $900 million.

716,"  COLORADO SPRINGS, Colorado May 21 The U.S. Air Force on Wednesday said it is very close to choosing Lockheed Martin Corp or Raytheon Co to build a new ground-based radar to track satellites and other objects in space, a deal analysts value at nearly $2 billion.""It's imminent,"" Brigadier General Roger Teague, director of strategic plans, programs and analyses for Air Force Space Command, said in n interview after a panel session at a space conference hosted by the Space Foundation.U.S. military officials have underscored the importance of the Space Fence program, given the growing number of countries operating satellites in space and development of anti-satellite weapons, as well as the huge amount of debris in orbit. The new program will allow the Air Force to sharply increase its ability to track ""space junk"" and other smaller objects in space. Currently the Air Force tracks about 23,000 of an estimated 500,000 objects in space, but the new program would allow it to track hundreds of thousands of additional objects. Teague said the new radar system would give the Air Force far greater insight into what is going on in low earth orbit and over the southern hemisphere.

722,"   By Andrea Shalal | COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo.  COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. May 23 The U.S. government's growing acceptance of commercial military satellites is opening the $20 billion-a-year market to new companies and forcing big arms makers such as Lockheed Martin  and Boeing to change how they operate.U.S. officials are trying to boost security of U.S. military and intelligence satellites, with an eye on risks from space debris and the proliferation of space-faring countries that could target U.S. satellites in a war.Officials hope the booming commercial satellite market can help the government obtain simpler and cheaper satellites, lower the cost of launching and create more options in other areas.After years of talk, U.S. budget cuts and changes in technology have started to alter a market long dominated by big contractors like Lockheed.""The space market is changing dramatically,"" said Henry Obering, senior vice president with Booz Allen Hamilton and former Missile Defense Agency director. ""The big companies will either adopt new ways of doing things or they will fail."" ""Change always creates angst,"" said Doug Loverro, deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy. He said market giants were more open to commercial practices, cutting costs, speeding up programs and testing new technologies.For instance, he said the Air Force cut the cost of a new ground-based radar for tracking space objects by two thirds by mandating prototypes and manufacturing demonstrations. A contract award to Lockheed or Raytheon Co is expected soon.Lockheed, Boeing and others are embracing new production processes such as 3D printing, and hunting down commercial orders to offset an expected slowdown in U.S. government buying. Loverro said the Pentagon was still expected to spend about $300 billion on military space programs over the next 15 years, but buying practices will change to make satellites more ""resilient."" ""Do we continue to buy what we've been used to buying, or do we move in a different direction?"" he said. He cited widespread agreement that the Air Force should stop buying Boeing-built Wideband Global System satellites since commercial satellites now carry more bandwidth.The Air Force is studying ways to use commercial bandwidth, beyond leasing services as it does during military operations.That could create opportunities for satellite operators like Iridium Communications, which plans to launch 66 new satellites starting in 2017 that will host payloads for the government or other customers.James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, said 90 percent of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's underlying intelligence now comes from companies like DigitalGlobe Inc. But he said companies should not rely on the government to underwrite new satellite programs.U.S. officials said they welcome competition in the rocket launch market. But new players such as Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, have complained that change is slow in coming and say the United States risks being overtaken by other countries.

724,"  (Adds official announcement by Pentagon, reaction from Raytheon)WASHINGTON, June 2 The Pentagon's No. 1 supplier, Lockheed Martin Corp, has won a $915 million contract to develop a ground-based radar for tracking objects in space for the U.S. Air Force, beating out a bid from Raytheon Co .The fixed-price contract, which includes an incentive fee, was announced late on Monday by the Pentagon in its daily digest of major contract awards. U.S. military officials have underscored the importance of the Air Force's Space Fence program, given the growing number of countries operating satellites in space, China's work on anti-satellite weapons, and the huge amount of debris in orbit. The new program will allow the Air Force to increase sharply its ability to track ""space junk"" and other smaller objects in space. Currently the Air Force tracks about 23,000 of an estimated 500,000 objects in space, but the new program would allow it to track hundreds of thousands of additional objects. Plans call for the new system to be based on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 2,100 miles southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii, and to start operating in September 2018.Raytheon said it had been notified about the Air Force's decision, but said it would be inappropriate to comment further until after it receives a post-decision debrief from Air Force officials.

726,"  (Adds Lockheed comment, byline)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 2 Lockheed Martin Corp  on Monday beat out Raytheon Co to win a $915 million contract from the U.S. Air Force for a ground-based radar that will track about 200,000 pieces of old satellites and other objects in space.The Pentagon announced the fixed-price contract for the new ""Space Fence,"" which includes an incentive fee, late on Monday in its daily digest of major contract awards.The deal covers development and construction of the new radar on Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands, about 2,100 miles (3,400 km) southwest of Honolulu, with initial operations to start in late 2018.The deal also includes an option for a second site in western Australia, said Steve Bruce, vice president for advanced systems at Lockheed's Mission Systems and Training Business. Bruce, speaking with reporters, declined to estimate the total value of the contract, including that option and others, but analysts said it would be worth just under $2 billion.U.S. officials have underscored the importance of the Space Fence program given the growing number of countries operating satellites in space, China's work on anti-satellite weapons, and the huge amount of debris in orbit around the earth.The program will increase the U.S. government's ability to track spent rocket boosters, dead satellites and other ""space junk"" that could damage satellites or the International Space Station, Bruce said. The Air Force now tracks about 23,000 of an estimated 500,000 objects orbiting the earth, but the new radar will increase that number tenfold.Brian Weeden, a former Air Force analyst who now works with the Secure World Foundation, said the new system still faced challenges, including the need for new computers to process the larger amount of data that will be collected. ""There's a lot that can still go wrong,"" he said. Raytheon said it had been notified about the Air Force's decision, but that it would be inappropriate to comment further until after it receives a post-decision debrief from Air Force officials. A company spokesman declined comment on whether it would protest the decision.Doug Loverro, deputy assistant secretary of defense for space policy, told Reuters last month that the Air Force cut the projected cost of the new radar system by two-thirds by mandating prototypes and manufacturing demonstrations.Bruce said the Air Force scaled back its requirements as a result of studies conducted by Lockheed and other companies in the early stages of the procurement process, ultimately deciding to use space-based assets to track debris in higher orbits.""The Air Force did a terrific job of looking at these requirements and coming up with something that's affordable,"" he said.Bruce declined to provide Lockheed's expected profit on the deal, or other details of the contract terms, but said the fixed-price deal was unusual for a development project.

727,"  * Top weapons buyer says ""No silver bullet""* U.S. Navy names General Dynamics, Lockheed units ""superior suppliers""* Shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls fails to make U.S. Navy listBy Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON, June 13 The U.S. Navy on Friday named units of top arms makers General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co as part of its list of the top-performing nine suppliers for 2014 based on their performance over the last three years.The Pentagon said on Friday it would use such public recognition of ""superior suppliers,"" incentives and competition as key tools in its ongoing drive to end years of cost overruns and schedule delays on key weapons programs. Top U.S. arms buyer Frank Kendall said the Navy developed the list as a pilot project this year, but he had asked the Air Force and Army to compile their own lists this year as part of the continuing effort to improve defense acquisition.""We want to recognize their performance, but we also want to motivate our performers who are not on that list to do better,"" Kendall told reporters as he released a second annual report on the Pentagon's procurement, development and operating budgets, which totalled over $350 billion in fiscal 2015 budget request.The nine companies also included units of General Electric , Northrop Grumman Corp, a venture of Lockheed and Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp, and Britain's Rolls Royce Holdings Plc. One notable exception was Huntington Ingalls Industries , one of the Navy's largest suppliers, and builder of aircraft carriers, submarines and other warships.Navy acquisition chief Sean Stackley said the suppliers that did make the list would be offered the chance to reduce certain contract requirements, including removal of some procedures, inspections or requirements, which could lead to cost savings.Kendall said the Pentagon had imposed affordability targets on 30 of its biggest programs and all but two or three were within those caps. But he said uncertainty about future budget levels continued to hamper more efficient investment decisions. He said the Pentagon remained focused on improving the way it buys hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons and services each year, but there was no single ""silver bullet"" to do that.Instead, he said the department needed to work on multiple fronts, including efforts to simplify the overlapping laws that govern defense acquisitions, better training for federal workers that administer contracts, and deeper analysis of past programs.""Defense acquisition is complicated and varying,"" he wrote in the 116-page report. ""We must empower, encourage and train our workforce to think - not dictate a cookbook that workforce members blindly follow.""The report cited good results from contracts with incentive fees, but said incentives were sometimes counterproductive and the Pentagon did not always use such measures as well as it could.Kendall also highlighted the importance of competition, but  said the department needed to get more creative about injecting competition into the process given declining defense budgets and growing consolidation in the industry.

Under federal law, contractors seeking to halt work on a contested program must file a protest within 10 days of the contract award, or five days after a mandatory briefing by the awarding agency.Raytheon still has until Thursday to protest the contract award, 10 days after its Air Force briefing, but that would not necessarily halt work on the program. Companies generally file within the earlier timeframe, the sources said. The company could also file a claim with the agency directly or with the Court of Federal Claims.Raytheon won a separate contract on June 2 to build the terminals for highly-secure military satellites that enable the U.S. president to communicate during a nuclear war, a contract once held by Boeing Co.Boeing spokesman Richard Esposito on Tuesday said his company had decided not to protest the decision following a debrief by the Air Force.

730,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. missile defense system managed by Boeing Co on Sunday hit a simulated enemy missile over the Pacific in the first successful intercept test of the program since 2008, the U.S. Defense Department said.The successful intercept will help validate the troubled Boeing-run Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system which provides the sole U.S. defense against long-range ballistic missiles, and the Raytheon Co kill vehicle that separates from the rocket and hits an incoming warhead.    ""This is a very important step in our continuing efforts to improve and increase the reliability of our homeland ballistic missile defense system,"" said Missile Defense Agency (MDA)Director Vice Admiral James Syring.He said the agency would continue its ongoing drive to ensure that the ground-based interceptors and overall homeland defense system were effective and dependable.Reuters reported on Friday that the Pentagon is restructuring its $3.48 billion contract with Boeing for management of the missile defense system to put more emphasis on maintenance and reliability.Sunday's high-stakes test came after the system had failed to hit a dummy missile in five of eight previous tests since the Bush administration rushed to deploy the system in 2004 to counter growing threats by North Korea. Earlier this month, Syring said that another test failure would have forced the Pentagon to reassess its plans to add 14 more interceptors to the 30 already in silos in the ground in Alaska and California.During the test, a long-range ground-based interceptor launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, intercepted an intermediate-range ballistic missile target launched from the U.S. Army's Reagan Test Site on Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Pentagon said.It said all components involved in the test appeared to have performed as designed. Program officials will spend the next several months assessing the performance of the system using telemetry and other data obtained during the test.The test marked the first successful intercept by Raytheon's Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle Capability Enhancement II, or EKV CE-II, which failed in both previous tests conducted in 2010.  The companies involved had no immediate comment.Ten of the interceptors now in place carry the kill vehicle used in Sunday's test. The other 20 carry an earlier kill vehicle that failed in a July 2013 test. Syring has said a fix will be implemented for that issue by year's end.Riki Ellison, founder of the nonprofit Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, hailed the successful test as a big step forward for the troubled program, and said it would allow U.S. military commanders to reduce the number of interceptors that would be fired at an incoming ballistic missile. ""This success is a significant milestone ... that demonstrates the system's reliability and increases the confidence of the North American Combatant Commander ... responsible for the defense of the country,"" he said.Critics said the Raytheon kill vehicle had still only succeeded in one of three tries, and urged Congress to rethink plans to buy 14 more of the flawed interceptors at a cost of $75 million each, or just over $1 billion.""Would you spend $1 billion on an insurance policy that only worked one third of the time?"" said Tom Collina, research director at the Arms Control Association. ""We need to put the money into making the system better, not bigger.""Phil Coyle, former Pentagon chief tester and a longtime critic, called for accelerated work on a new design. ""We need to make sure we have a system that works, not expand a system we know to be deeply flawed,"" he said in a statement.

733,"  * Bids from Lockheed Martin and Israel are dropped* Tender was revised after Russia intervened in Ukraine* Poland choosing operational systems over advanced technology   (Recasts, updates with statement from losing consortium)By Marcin GoettigWARSAW, June 30 Poland has short-listed a consortium of France's Thales and European group MBDA, as well as U.S. firm Raytheon, in its tender for a mid-range missile defence system, the defence ministry said on Monday.The bids that lost out on the tender, which is estimated to be worth about $5 billion, were from the Israeli government and the MEADS consortium led by Lockheed Martin.Poland, a NATO member since 1999, had accelerated the process to select a supplier for the missile system after Russia's intervention in Ukraine prompted fears among NATO members in eastern Europe they could be next in line. The Polish defence ministry also changed the criteria for the system, saying it should be already operational and in use by a NATO member state's armed forces.That ruled out the Lockheed Martin-led bid, which involved technology still in development, and the Israeli bid, called David's Sling, which is also not yet in operation.The ministry said terms of the tender will ensure the participation of Poland's domestic defence industry in the construction of the missile defence, with the state defence holding Polska Grupa Zbrojeniowa playing a key role. Raytheon welcomed the announcement.""We are moving ahead to provide Poland with the most advanced air and missile defense system in use today by 12 countries around the world,"" said Dan Crowley, President, Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems.""And (we) look forward to partnering with the Polish industry to build the next generation Patriot system."" The first phase of the Polish system, know in Poland as Wisla, is for eight sets of mid-range interceptor rockets, which may later be supplemented by short-range ones.Poland has already passed legislation to secure funding for the system, the ministry said earlier this year.MEADS International issued a statement saying it was disappointed with Poland's announcement, but that it would keep working with existing national partners Germany and Italy to finish development of the system.""Today's announcement reflects new criteria for the Wisla selection, and should they change again, we stand ready with the most advanced air and missile defence system available today.""The planned system is separate from elements of a U.S. missile shield to be deployed in Poland by 2018, as confirmed by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on a visit to Warsaw this week.($1 = 3.0482 Polish Zlotys)    (Additional reporting by Andrea Shalal-Esa in Washington; Editing by David Evans)",2014-06-30,RTN,"Mon Jun 30, 2014 | 2:39pm EDT","UPDATE 2-Poland short-lists Raytheon, Thales in missile system tender",http://www.reuters.com//article/poland-defence-idUSL6N0PB4WM20140630?type=companyNews,0.8658,0.02,0.911,0.069

The CBOE market volatility index fell 5.7 percent to 15.71 in a sign of reduced investor uncertainty. Stocks have been under pressure of late as investors, worried about high valuations and uncertainty around the world, pulled back from riskier assets. Before Friday's rally, the S&P 500 had given up more than 4 percent while the small-cap Russell was down 7 percent over the past four weeks.Markets rallied after Russia's Defense Ministry said Friday it had finished military exercises in southern Russia, which the United States had criticized as a provocative step amid the Ukraine crisis.""The market hates uncertainty, and when it doesn't have enough information about how badly an event could impact the economy, it tends to take the worst-case scenario and people sell off,"" said Malcolm Polley, president and chief investment officer of Stewart Capital Advisors in Indiana, Pennsylvania. ""With the news of the de-escalating in Russia, and also with the administration saying exactly what they are doing in Iraq, it's helped clear up some uncertainty in the market.""Earlier on Friday, the United States carried out air strikes targeting Islamic State fighters marching on Iraq's Kurdish capital. The strikes were the first authorized on Iraq since President Barack Obama pulled American troops out in 2011.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 182.52 points, or 1.12 percent, to 16,550.79. The S&P 500 ended up 21.84 points, or 1.14 percent, to 1,931.41. The Nasdaq Composite  added 36.02 points, or 0.83 percent, to 4,370.99. For the week, the Dow rose 0.4 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.3 percent, and the Nasdaq rose 0.4 percent.Utilities were the day's biggest gainer among S&P sectors, rising 2 percent, followed by a 1.7 percent increase in energy shares.Shares of defense companies also performed well, with Lockheed Martin Corp ending the day up 1.8 percent to $165.80, Raytheon Co up 2.4 percent to $91.61 and Northrop Grumman Corp up 2.1 percent to $122.86.U.S.-traded shares of Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp  surged 45.1 percent to $20.70 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared the company's experimental Ebola treatment for potential use in humans.

The initial contract will fund continued development and low-rate production of a few radar systems, followed by orders for nearly 30 more. Industry executives also see potential opportunities for selling the system to U.S. allies.Kendall had told Reuters in an interview earlier Tuesday that he was ""not quite finished"" looking at the Air Force's business plan for the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar program, or 3DELLR, but an announcement could come soon.

In its request for proposals, the Air Force said it expected the new system to be more accurate, reliable and give air controllers a precise view of aircraft and missiles.Pawlikowski said the Air Force had applied some of the lessons it learned on other large-scale acquisition programs in structuring the next-generation radar program, including efforts to strictly rein in military requirements and funding work on prototypes before choosing a design.Executives at the three companies have been expecting a contract announcement for several weeks.

It will serve as the Air Force's primary long-range, ground-based sensors for detecting and tracking aircraft and missiles. The Air Force said the new system would be more accurate, reliable and give air controllers a precise real-time view.Raytheon's initial $19.5 million deal, which runs through Oct. 31, 2018, will cover continued development of the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) program, and construction of three initial systems. The Air Force then plans to buy three more systems for a total of $72 million.Over time, the value of the contract is likely to rise significantly since the Air Force is expected to order 30 more radar systems, and foreign militaries could soon follow suit since the system was designed from the start to allow exports. Loren Thompson with the Lexington Institute said the contract was the latest in ""Raytheon's impressive string of competitive wins"" and marked the third setback in a row for Northrop. ""Raytheon is steadily taking market share in the midst of a defense downturn,"" he said.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the new radar embodied concepts mapped out in a new strategic framework, including the need to design ""exportability"" into weapons early on to lower the cost of buying and maintaining weapons systems. Raytheon welcomed the news, saying it had developed an ""affordable, exportable radar"" that would meet the requirements of many U.S. allies and could work together with older systems. Raytheon said using gallium-nitride allowed the firm to improve the range, sensitivity and search capabilities of the radar without excessive cost.

781,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The Pentagon on Thursday said it had ordered a review of  Raytheon Co's work on a new ground control system for Global Positioning System satellites after an Air Force-ordered restructuring drove the program's cost significantly higher.The current contract value is $1.6 billion, according to Air Force officials, which marks an increase of over 80 percent from the initial contract value of $886 million.Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, on Tuesday ordered a ""deep dive"" review, starting in January, of the next-generation GPS Operational Control System (OCX) that Raytheon is developing, according to his spokeswoman, Maureen Schumann.Kendall told an investor conference in New York on Tuesday that most U.S. weapons programs were within 2-3 percent of their cost targets, but he was keeping an eye on one program that was ""significantly over."" He did not name the program. Schumann told Reuters on Thursday that Kendall was referring to the Raytheon OCX program.The U.S. Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center awarded Raytheon a contract in February 2010 to develop the hardware and software needed to control U.S. GPS satellites and ensure the security of their signals, but the program has run into technical challenges and cost increases. Including options, the total contract was initially valued at $1.5 billion.The Air Force this summer restructured the OCX program, increasing the value of the base contract by 80.5 percent from $886 million to $1.6 billion, and delaying its completion by two years to 2018.  A spokeswoman for the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center confirmed the contract value was now $1.6 billion, and said it included options for further work. She did not spell out the percentage increase or the value of the options.

Kendall said the cost growth on the program was due to both ""execution issues"" on the part of the contractor, and changes in requirements by the Air Force.He said he had spoken with Raytheon's management about the program, and the company had agreed to provide additional resources to ensure the program's success.

783,"  * Plan to get troubled $7 bln programme back on track* Project has been blighted by long delays and cost blowouts* Defence minister plans sovereign submarine building industry   (Adds more details on destroyer and submarine programmes)By Jane WardellSYDNEY, Dec 9 Defence contractors BAE Systems Plc, Navantia SA and Raytheon Co will increase their roles in Australia's A$8.5 billion ($7 billion) warship building project as the country tries to get the troubled programme back on track.Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said on Tuesday the trio's increased involvement will drive immediate improvements in shipbuilding performance, without giving any financial details of their expanded contracts.Australia's Air Warfare Destroyer project has been blighted by long delays and cost blowouts. An auditor's report earlier this year found that local shipyards were not fully prepared to take on the complex work, while Spain's Navantia provided poor blueprints marred by ""drawing errors or omissions"" and late changes.""The good news is we have turned a corner,"" Cormann told reporters. ""We're committed to stop the growing scheduling and cost overruns."" BAE, Navantia and Raytheon were chosen to increase their involvement after a competitive procurement process, Cormann said.Navantia will contribute design function skills, BAE will coordinate shipbuilding and Raytheon will offer management skills.Raytheon was already part of the programme's AWD Alliance, rounded out by government military purchaser Defence Materiel Organisation and government-owned shipbuilder Australian Submarine Corp (ASC). SUBMARINE SOVEREIGNTY Defence Minister David Johnston said the kickstart to the destroyer programme was the first step of a plan aimed at restoring the future of naval maritime capability in Australia, including the creation of a ""sovereign industry around submarines.""Johnston declined to comment when asked if that meant the country's next submarines would be built in Australia. The defence minister was forced to apologise last month after saying he would not trust ASC ""to build a canoe"", comments that fuelled expectations that most of the work in an A$40 billion programme will go offshore.Reuters reported in September that Australia was leaning toward buying as many as 12 off-the-shelf stealth submarines from Japan.Prime Minister Tony Abbott had previously pledged the submarines would be built in South Australia, where unemployment exceeds the national average, but his government began back-pedalling in July, signalling cost and schedule were paramount.Tuesday's announcement came as results from a by-election indicated that Abbott's Liberal Party may concede a majority government to the opposition Labor Party in South Australia.Johnston, who has faced increasing pressure to step down from his portfolio, said more detail on the defence programme would be provided in the government's Defence White Paper, due out next year.($1 = 1.2057 Australian dollars)   (Editing by Andre Grenon and Lisa Shumaker)",2014-12-08,RTN,"Mon Dec 8, 2014 | 5:50pm EST","UPDATE 1-BAE, Navantia, Raytheon to up role in Australian shipbuilding",http://www.reuters.com//article/australia-defense-idUSL3N0TS5DE20141208?type=companyNews,-0.0834,0.069,0.857,0.074

790,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force has agreed to reevaluate proposals received in a competition for a long-range radar system initially won by Raytheon Co (RTN.N), after two losing bidders filed protests, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The Air Force's action is expected to resolve the two separate protests, which were filed by Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT.N) and Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) days after the contract was first awarded to Raytheon in October, according to the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly.The decision followed a series of hearings held by the Government Accountability Office, the congressional agency that evaluates federal contract disputes.""The Air Force is taking corrective action,"" said one of the sources. The protesting companies were now evaluating the proposed actions to determine whether they would render their protests moot, the source added. Attorneys for the companies involved declined comment, as did spokesmen for the Air Force and the GAO.It was unclear how long the Air Force reevaluation of the bids would take, but one source said it could include a more technical assessment of proposals submitted by the companies. Raytheon in October beat out Northrop and Lockheed to develop a replacement for the Air Force's current TPS-75 radar, which has been in service since the late 1960s. The new radar will serve as the Air Force's primary long-range, ground-based sensors for detecting and tracking aircraft and missiles. The value of the Three Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR) contract is limited now but could eventually rise to about $1 billion, given the Air Force's plan to buy 30 of the new systems in coming years. Orders from foreign militaries for as many as 100 of the new systems could further expand the value of the contract, one of few new large acquisition programs awarded by the Air Force.

795,"   By Andrea Shalal and Sagarika Jaisinghani  U.S. arms maker Raytheon Co (RTN.N) forecast 2015 revenue largely below average analyst expectations as orders fell, and said adjusted profit margins would drop further to just over 12 percent, sending its shares down as much as 6 percent.The maker of the Tomahawk missile and the Patriot missile defense system on Thursday said it expected revenue to grow modestly in 2016, with further growth seen in subsequent years.Orders fell 5.4 percent to $7.11 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.But the company said it expected to finalize in the first quarter a $2 billion order for the Patriot missile defense system that was initially expected last year.U.S. arms makers have been hurt in recent years by the Pentagon's plan to cut $1 trillion in spending over a decade as required by a 2011 law.Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Dave Wajsgras told Reuters he expected low single-digit revenue growth in 2016, with acquisitions, foreign orders and increasing U.S. demand seen accelerating gains in subsequent years. Foreign orders would account for about 30 to 35 percent of bookings and 30 percent of overall revenue in 2015, he said.Wajsgras, who will head Raytheon's information systems business from March, said the company was investing in new technologies such as cybersecurity and electronic warfare to boost internal growth. More strategic acquisitions are also planned.Incoming CFO Toby O'Brien told analysts the company would continue to buy back shares and propose higher dividends. Last year, dividend payments rose 6 percent to $735 million, while share repurchases fell 30 percent to $750 million.Raytheon forecast earnings of $6.20-$6.35 per share from continuing operations and revenue of $22.3 billion to $22.8 billion for 2015. It expects to earn $5.49 to $5.64 per share, excluding items. It said operating margins, adjusted for pension payments, are expected to drop to between 12.1 and 12.3 percent in 2015, down from 12.7 percent in 2014 and 13.4 percent in 2013.Analysts were expecting earnings of $6.89 per share and revenue of $22.6 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Defense consultant Loren Thompson said Raytheon's longer-term prospects were bright, noting it was beating incumbents for new contracts in radar systems. He said the company forecasts were likely conservative. Net income attributable to Raytheon rose to $582 million, or $1.88 per share, in the fourth quarter, from $531 million or $1.66 per share a year earlier.Excluding items, the company earned $1.71 per share.Revenue rose 4.7 percent to $6.14 billion, above the $6.07 billion analysts had expected.Raytheon shares fell as much as 6 percent on Thursday and were still down 3.7 percent at $100.68 in early afternoon.

796,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Raytheon Co (RTN.N) on Thursday said it has ""turned a corner"" on problems with the ground control system it is building for the U.S. Air Force's global positioning system satellites, and does not expect any impact on financial results.Chief Executive Officer Tom Kennedy said the company had worked closely with the Air Force to resolve issues with the GPS Operational Control System (OCX), noting that it was a complex and technologically advanced program.""We believe we have turned a corner on that program moving forward. We don't see any impact in this year or in the out years relative to that program,"" Kennedy told an earnings call with analysts.Pentagon arms buyer Frank Kendall last year ordered a ""deep dive"" review of the program after the contract's value increased by over 80 percent to $1.6 billion. The review has been delayed until early February due to schedule conflicts, his office said on Thursday. Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, warned in a report delivered to Congress this month that delays in the delivery of the new ground control program posed risks to the Air Force's ability to operate the GPS system of satellites. The report cited a three-year delay in the operational evaluation of the new ground system to early 2019, and said the Air Force would not receive the first OCX control station until after six to eight of the GPS-III satellites have been built and launched. Matt Gilligan, the Raytheon vice president who runs the OCX program, said a separate, early OCX system would be delivered in time to support the launch, checkout and early-orbit control of the first GPS III satellite, and any payloads. Any problems found would be addressed during a six-month period before delivery of the first ground station, he said.The Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog agency, is finalizing a report on the GPS program.The Air Force last summer restructured a $886 million contract awarded to Raytheon in February 2010 to develop the hardware and software needed to control GPS satellites after the program has run into technical challenges and cost increases. The changes raised the cost by 80.5 percent to $1.6 billion, and delayed its completion by two years to 2018.The Air Force on Thursday said it was actively tracking the risks identified by Gilmore's report and said senior leaders regularly reviewed a detailed mitigation plan and milestones that had been developed for each potential risk.

We don't see any impact in this year or in the out years relative to that program,"" Kennedy told an earnings call with analysts. Pentagon arms buyer Frank Kendall last year ordered a ""deep dive"" review of the program after the contract's value increased by over 80 percent to $1.6 billion.The review has been delayed until early February due to schedule conflicts, his office said on Thursday.Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's chief weapons tester, warned in a report delivered to Congress this month that delays in the delivery of the new ground control program posed risks to the Air Force's ability to operate the GPS system of satellites. The report cited a three-year delay in the operational evaluation of the new ground system to early 2019, and said the Air Force would not receive the first OCX control station until after six to eight of the GPS-III satellites have been built and launched.Matt Gilligan, the Raytheon vice president who runs the OCX program, said a separate, early OCX system would be delivered in time to support the launch, checkout and early-orbit control of the first GPS III satellite, and any payloads. Any problems found would be addressed during a six-month period before delivery of the first ground station, he said. The Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog agency, is finalizing a report on the GPS program.The Air Force last summer restructured a $886 million contract awarded to Raytheon in February 2010 to develop the hardware and software needed to control GPS satellites after the program has run into technical challenges and cost increases.The changes raised the cost by 80.5 percent to $1.6 billion, and delayed its completion by two years to 2018.The Air Force on Thursday said it was actively tracking the risks identified by Gilmore's report and said senior leaders regularly reviewed a detailed mitigation plan and milestones that had been developed for each potential risk.

Raytheon Chief Financial Officer Dave Wajsgras told Reuters he expected low single-digit revenue growth in 2016, with acquisitions, foreign orders and increasing U.S. demand seen accelerating gains in subsequent years.Foreign orders would account for about 30 to 35 percent of bookings and 30 percent of overall revenue in 2015, he said.Wajsgras, who will head Raytheon's information systems business from March, said the company was investing in new technologies such as cybersecurity and electronic warfare to boost internal growth. More strategic acquisitions are also planned. Incoming CFO Toby O'Brien told analysts the company would continue to buy back shares and propose higher dividends. Last year, dividend payments rose 6 percent to $735 million, while share repurchases fell 30 percent to $750 million.Raytheon forecast earnings of $6.20-$6.35 per share from continuing operations and revenue of $22.3 billion to $22.8 billion for 2015.

""It's our desire to get the best of all three, and that's what we intend to do,"" Syring said.The redesign effort is part of a broader effort led by Syring to improve the reliability of the existing fleet of ground-based interceptors after a series of test failures, quality problems and other issues in recent years.The agency conducted a successful intercept test in June for the first time since 2008. A non-intercept test was planned this year to evaluate alternative ""divert thruster"" to steer the interceptor, with the next intercept test slated a year later. Boeing runs the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system for the government, but the Missile Defense Agency will take over the effort to develop a new more reliable kill vehicle or warhead once its plan is approved. Syring said the Pentagon was ""very close"" to approving the plan.The agency requested $279 million as part of its overall $8.1 billion budget to continue design work on a new kill vehicle to improve reliability, availability and performance, and ensure the warheads were more producible. The agency's 2016 budget request also includes funding for a detailed look at the reliability and design characteristics of the current fleet of interceptors.Syring said the agency also planned to award a contract for development of a new long-range discriminating radar before the end of fiscal 2015.

808,"  (Adds Raytheon statement)By Wiktor SzaryWARSAW Feb 5 Poland may review its decision to drop Lockheed Martin Corp's MEADS system from its $5 billion missile defence tender, a senior source at the Polish Ministry of Defence said.The Polish programme is particularly significant for the defence sector given recent cuts to military spending. Poland plans to spend an estimated total of 130 billion zlotys ($36 billion) between 2013 and 2022 on modernising its armed forces.Last year, Poland excluded the Lockheed Martin-led consortium from the tender, short-listing two contenders: a consortium of European group MBDA and France's Thales SA , and U.S. firm Raytheon Co, as potential suppliers.This decision may now be reviewed, the source said, if Germany decides to implement MEADS. The Polish defence ministry, MEADS and Raytheon did not immediately reply to requests for comment. MBDA declined to comment. ""MEADS could still very well end up being on the table,"" the source said. ""We will consider allowing the MEADS system to take part in the tender, if Germany decides that it will be at the core of their missile defence.""""Formally, MEADS' participation in the Polish tender is still possible,"" the source added.Lockheed had no immediate comment on the news. Raytheon spokeswoman Kristin Hilf said the company had no indication that Poland had plans to change its approach since the June 2014 decision to short-list two bidders.Berlin is deciding whether to modernise its missile defences, based on Raytheon's Patriot system, or implement MEADS. A German decision to commit to Lockheed Martin's system would help the consortium meet Poland's requirement that all proposed solutions have to be operational and in use by another NATO member state's armed forces.""Poland wants its missile defence systems to be compatible with German ones, because Germany is our closest ally,"" the source said.Last year, a senior German government source told Reuters the decision could come in 2015, once technical and legal questions have been clarified.According to a document seen by Reuters, the decision could be made this summer, but the Polish Ministry of Defence source said Poland thought Berlin could reach a decision as soon as Feb. 15.The United States, Italy and Germany spent about $3.4 billion over the past decade to develop MEADS as a successor to Patriot, but the United States decided in 2012 to withdraw due to budget cuts.

813,"  (Adds comments from Raytheon)By Tulay KaradenizANKARA Feb 19 Turkey's defence minister said on Thursday the country does not plan to integrate a new missile defence system with NATO infrastructure and officials said a $3.4 billion deal with China was still under consideration.NATO member Turkey chose China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp as a preferred bidder in 2013, prompting U.S. and Western concern about security and the compatibility of the weaponry with NATO systems.Defence Minister Ismet Yilmaz, in a written response to a parliamentary question, indicated Ankara planned to go ahead with the Chinese system, saying the evaluation of bids had been completed and no new offers received. ""The system in question will be integrated with the national system for Turkey's defence and will be used without integrating with NATO,"" Yilmaz said.However, other government officials later made clear that did not mean a final decision had yet been reached. ""We are continuing discussions with all the bidders,"" the undersecretariat for defence industries said in a statement.U.S. and NATO officials are unhappy with Turkey's choice of the China Precision Machinery, which has been under U.S. sanctions for selling items to Iran, Syria or North Korea that are banned under U.S. laws to curb the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Eurosam, which is owned by Franco-Italian missile maker MBDA and France's Thales, came second in the tender. U.S.-listed Raytheon Co also put in an offer with its Patriot missile defense system, which is now operated by 13 countries around the world.Tim Glaeser, vice president with Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems business, said that Turkey had recently asked for additional clarifications about Raytheon's proposal.""It's our understanding that they are continuing to evaluate proposals from the French and the United States,"" Glaeser said. ""There's renewed interest. We're still in the game.""

814,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. government has approved Raytheon Co to export a new Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) sensor based on gallium nitride semiconductor technology to countries that have Patriot missile defense systems, the company said Thursday.Raytheon has invested more than $150 million over the past 15 years in gallium nitride, or GaN, and it is part of a new Air and Missile Defense Radar that Raytheon is building for the U.S. Navy, as well as several Air Force programs.The export release of the new GaN-based AESA radar could boost Raytheon's prospects in a big Polish missile defense competition since it would give the system the ability to see a 360-degree view of potential threats.Tim Glaeser, vice president at Raytheon Integrated Defense Systems, said the new GaN-based sensor was ""gamechanging"" because it would help improve the reliability of the radar and lower its operating and maintenance costs.Raytheon is bidding against a French competitor in Poland. Glaeser said a decision by Poland or another foreign country to buy the new GaN-based AESA radar would help ensure that the U.S. Army could upgrade to the new capability in 2017.U.S. Army officials have said they plan to operate the Patriot system through 2048, but there is no funding in the Army budget for Patriot upgrades until 2017. Over $100 million in research and development investments, and a big order by the United Arab Emirates helped kick off the previous modernization of the Patriot weapons system.Glaeser said Raytheon had demonstrated the new GaN-based sensors at its test facility in New Hampshire in December for a U.S. government group and a high-level German delegation. The testing showed the sensors could help the Patriot system track ballistic missiles and other targets outside its current range.He said Germany is expected to make a decision in the late spring or early summer. Poland is also expected to make a decision about a new missile defense system this year.

Defense sources said the more recent tests took place last week and on Tuesday. The latter coincided with international negotiations on Iran's disputed nuclear program that have drawn censure from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and in turn soured his relations with U.S. President Barack Obama.Moshe Yaalon, Israel's defence minister, cited David's Sling as a mark of the continued vigour of the Israeli-U.S. alliance.""We believe that next year it (David's Sling) is going to be operational,"" Yaalon told visiting U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, and added thanks for Washington's funding.David's Sling and its Stunner interceptor missiles successfully hit ""threat representative targets"" in the tests, said Rick Lehner, spokesman for the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, which carried out the third series of tests of the system together with the Israel Missile Defense Organization (IMDO). ""This ... is a major milestone in the development of the David's Sling weapon and provides confidence in future Israeli capabilities to defend against the developing threat,"" he said.MDA Director Vice Admiral James Syring said Washington was pleased with the test results and vowed to continue U.S. assistance to Israel's missile defense technology efforts.Known in Hebrew as Magic Wand, David's Sling is being developed and manufactured jointly by Israel's state-owned Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Ltd and Raytheon Co, a top U.S. arms maker. Designed to shoot down rockets with ranges of 100 km to 200 km (63 miles to 125 miles), aircraft or low-flying cruise missiles, David's Sling will fill the operational gap between Israel's Iron Dome short-range rocket interceptor and the Arrow ballistic missile interceptor, both already in service.The latest successful tests are likely to strengthen support among U.S. lawmakers for Israel's request for additional funds.Israeli officials last month asked Congress for an additional $317 million for David's Sling and other Israeli missile defense programs, on top of $158 million already requested by the Obama administration in its fiscal 2016 budget.Fuelling the sense of urgency around David's Sling development, Israeli media on Wednesday published military assessments that, in the next war with Hezbollah, the guerrillas could rain up to 1,500 rockets on Israel daily, killing hundreds of civilians.The latest tests were conducted under unusually strict secrecy, and had been rescheduled at least once. One date that had been considered, planners said, was March 3 -- hours before Netanyahu, at Boehner's invitation, gave a speech at the U.S. Congress that both praised Obama for supporting Israel's security but rebuked him over the nuclear diplomacy with Iran.David's Sling was first tested on Nov. 25, 2012, shooting down a simulated rocket. It experienced an early setback when a Nov. 18, 2013 trial failed because of a faulty sensor setting, a person who was present told Reuters.

829,"  * Poland to buy U.S. Patriot missiles in $5 bln tender* Says eyes Airbus helicopter in $3 bln tender* France says Poland to have key industrial role   (Adds comment from U.S. State Department)By Wiktor Szary and Marcin GoettigWARSAW, April 21 Poland said on Tuesday it would buy Raytheon Co's Patriot missiles from the United States and provisionally selected French Airbus Group  helicopters as it speeds up the modernization of its military amid tensions with Russia.The choice of suppliers, in deals potentially worth $8 billion, strikes a trans-Atlantic balance as Eastern Europe's largest economy re-arms itself on NATO's frontline while edging toward a bigger role in Europe's defense industry.""For the armed forces' technical modernization and the Polish armed forces' resilience to be effective, the so-called anti-missile shield ... had to become the priority of priorities,"" said Polish President Bronislaw Komorowski.Poland will enter exclusive talks with the U.S. government on the Patriot missile defense system. It plans to buy eight missile batteries by 2025, including two within three years of signing. A consortium of France's Thales and European group MBDA was also competing for the $5 billion missile defense contract - the largest in Poland's military history.The United States said it welcomed the announcement from its stalwart NATO ally.The program ""is expected to generate at least $2.5 billion in U.S. export content - that means supporting American jobs at home and growing our manufacturing base,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement.Poland, a NATO member since 1999, had accelerated the process to select a supplier for the missile system after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea Peninsula last year prompted great concern among NATO members in Eastern Europe. Since the end of the Cold War, Poland has usually kept closer defense and security ties with the United States.But in the past few years, policymakers have been lobbying for a stronger security relationship with the rest of Europe, especially after the Obama administration scaled back its missile defense shield plans in Eastern Europe.AIRBUS STATUS  Poland also named the Caracal EC725 of Airbus Helicopters as its preferred choice in a $3 billion utility helicopter tender, subject to army testing, dropping U.S. and Italian competitors.It trimmed the potential order from an original 70 helicopters to 50. This would still represent Poland's biggest defense acquisition from Western Europe since the end of the Cold War. Deliveries could begin as early as 2017.The helicopter decision was seen as delicate because rival bidders Sikorsky, United Technologies Corp's helicopter unit in the United States, and AgustaWestland, owned by Italy's Finmeccanica, have factories in Poland whose unions had warned of job losses.A French defense official said the Caracal helicopters and their Turbomeca engines would both be assembled in Poland as part of a wide-ranging industrial pact. Airbus has offered what could evolve into ""fifth nation"" status for Poland alongside its Western European founders to support its bid.The official said Poland had monitored France's decision last year to suspend delivery of warships to Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis, but denied any explicit link between that move and Poland's decision to buy French hardware.Poland said that because of ""changing security circumstances,"" it had decided to speed up a separate acquisition of attack helicopters.Four companies have expressed interest in supplying some 30 units in a deal already brought forward by two years in light of the crisis in Ukraine.

845,"  (Repeats story with no change to text)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON May 15 A U.S.-supplied missile shield to protect Gulf nations against Iranian attacks will take years to complete, requiring a step-up in regional trust, more U.S. sales of sensitive weapons, and intensive U.S. training to avoid mishaps in the volatile region.A renewed joint commitment to build the regional defense system was one of the few firm outcomes of Thursday's Camp David summit between President Barack Obama and Gulf allies, which were seeking fresh U.S. defense pledges ahead of a possible nuclear deal they fear will empower arch-rival Iran.Past efforts have stalled due to tension and mistrust within the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) but U.S. and Gulf officials say the time is now ripe to push ahead as Arab nations mount more joint military missions.A joint statement following the summit said that the GCC states were committed to developing a ballistic missile defense capability, including an early warning system, with U.S. technical help. Washington pledged to fast-track arms transfers to the GCC states and to send a team to the region in the coming weeks to discuss the details.The Gulf nations fear that the sanctions relief that would accompany a nuclear deal with Tehran due by June 30 could revive Iran's economy and enable it to acquire more accurate and reliable missiles.An integrated defense system would allow Gulf countries to better repel an Iranian attack, stitching together their radars and interceptors to counter a range of different missiles.The system would use U.S. early-warning satellites and a mix of U.S. and Gulf radars to detect the launch of an enemy missile and fire a ground- or sea-based missile to destroy it far above the earth. CLOSER SHARING NEEDED Lockheed Martin Corp, Raytheon Co. and Northrop Grumman Corp would be key contenders to build a central command-and-control system for the shield since they already do similar work for the U.S. military and key allies.The biggest challenge to making the shield work would be securing a broad agreement on the rules for dealing with any threats, said Anthony Cordesman, a senior analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.""You have to work out the entire engagement structure before the first missile is ever launched,"" Cordesman said. Getting to that point will require unprecedented agreements between the U.S. military and the GCC, and among the often rancorous Gulf allies, to share sensitive data to avoid the risk of a friendly aircraft being shot down by mistake, experts said.Intensive U.S.-led training would also be vital to minimize the risk of mishaps, U.S. officials say.The U.S. military already has 10 Patriot missile batteries to defend against short-range ballistic missiles in the Gulf region and Jordan, as well as a powerful AN-TPY-2 radar system to scan for missile launches, according to U.S. officials.The Gulf countries are upgrading their existing Raytheon Patriot systems to incorporate new PAC-3 missiles built by Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp, and are starting to buy wider-area and longer-range systems like the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), built by Lockheed.Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told reporters in Washington this week that Gulf countries would need new ground-based networks and computer terminals to manage those systems. He said the Gulf countries also wanted longer-range options like the Raytheon SM-3 missile, which has not yet been released for export to the region.Washington has balked at selling a land-based Aegis combat system to deal with missile threats and any associated SM-3 missiles to Gulf countries, largely because such a system would be best suited to dealing with threats outside the earth's atmosphere that are beyond Iran's capability, Cordesman said.Washington's decision in December to allow U.S. arms sales to the GCC as an organization - similar to its arrangement with NATO - helped pave the way for progress on integrating missile defense and maritime security systems.""That's a huge step in the right direction,"" said a U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly.Cordesman said Raytheon's new SM-6 missile could prove useful to address Gulf concerns since it could address threats inside the earth's atmosphere as well as outside.U.S. officials had no immediate comment on whether the Gulf countries had made any formal request for the SM-6 system.Al-Jubeir cautioned against expecting rapid progress on missile defense integration.""Those are complicated systems that take time to acquire and then take time to put in place,"" he said.

German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen announced the decision and said MEADS would make it possible to put a protective shield around entire cities and military camps.Von der Leyen said Germany plans to keep the huge new procurement program on track by setting up specific controls and  milestones. If the companies fail to meet those targets, Germany could still cancel the contract and give Patriot maker Raytheon another chance at the deal, she said.German opposition parties criticized the decision to proceed with the MEADs program, saying there were significant technical, financial and strategic concerns about the system. Lockheed and MBDA, a consortium that includes Italy's Finmeccanica SpA, Airbus Group and Britain's BAE Systems Plc, hailed the German decision.MBDA said MEADS would give the German military a powerful state-of-the-art system that can handle current and future threats, and said it recognized its responsibility in building a solid basis for the successful introduction of the system. Lockheed, the largest U.S. weapons maker, said in a statement that it was fully committed to the success of Germany's Taktisches Luftverteidigungssystem (TVLS) with MBDA.It said the system was designed to significantly reduce operation and support costs by covering a larger area with less manpower and equipment, and less demand on airlift.Raytheon said in a statement that it had not been formally notified of any decision by the German government, and would continue to support its ""consideration of alternatives prior to a final contract award"".The United States, citing budget cuts, opted out of the system in 2012.

Northrop and Boeing Co have also said they plan to compete for the contract when the Air Force launches a competition in the coming years.The head of Lockheed's aeronautics division, Orlando Carvalho, told Reuters the project would be led by Lockheed's Skunkworks research and development shop and would feature an open architecture that would allow the government to own the technical baseline for future upgrades. Lockheed will serve as the main integrator for the project, while Raytheon will bring its expertise with various surveillance sensors, mission systems integration, and JSTARS communications.Bombardier will provide its ultra-long-range Global business jet, which Lockheed said is less expensive to operate than modern airliners and requires less refueling. ""We plan to bring all this technology and expertise together to offer what we believe will be a very competitive solution,"" Carvalho said.Lockheed said the teaming agreement matched the U.S. government's desire for strong industry partnerships and would give the Air Force superior capabilities.Carvalho said it was the first time that Lockheed had teamed up to pursue a major program with Bombardier. The Air Force already uses the Bombardier Global as the basis for its  Battlefield Airborne Communications Node, or BACN program.

Revenues rose 3 percent to $5.8 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S had forecast earnings of $488 million or $1.62 per share and revenues of $5.48 billion.The company said its $1.9 billion acquisition of Websense, a cybersecurity firm, was going better than expected and the unit should be accretive to earnings in two to three years, instead of three to four years as initially expected.Chief Executive Tom Kennedy told analysts the company saw strong demand for cybersecurity given continuing attacks on private and federal computer networks, as well as growing international demand for the company's weapons systems.He said international orders accounted for a record 44 percent of the company's backlog at the end of the second quarter, something he called a ""monumental"" achievement.

Lawmakers have 15 days to block the sale, although such action is rare since deals are usually vetted carefully before being formally notified to Congress.DSCA, which facilitates foreign arms sales, said the deal would enhance the Spanish military's ability to carry out surveillance and reconnaissance in support of NATO missions, and as part of other coalition efforts. It would also allow Spain to work better together with other MQ-9 operators including the United Kingdom, France and Italy. The agency said the Spanish Air Force would use the MQ-9s for homeland security, peacekeeping, counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations.Other contractors on the deal would include Raytheon Co  and L-3 Communications Holdings Inc, the agency said.

879,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Oct 19 The business development company Starburst Accelerator, which calls itself the world's largest incubator for aerospace startups, said on Monday it has signed agreements with Boeing Co, Raytheon Co and other big companies looking for new technologies.Starburst will expose the big aerospace companies to its stable of fledgling aerospace companies with products ranging from drones to aircraft seats to complex aviation software. It says many of its start-ups have technology that could radically alter the way aircraft are now built and maintained.It opened its new California office on Oct. 2 with an event similar to the ""Shark Tank"" television program, an ABC TV reality show in which entrepreneurs seek investments from a panel of potential investors, known as ""sharks.""The goal is to match aerospace entrepreneurs with venture capitalists and larger companies that may invest in them or buy their products. The event gave 29 startups a chance to seek funding from 100 industry executives, venture capitalists and research institutes, said Starburst partner Van Espahbodi, who helped found the company in Paris three years ago.The California event was hosted by Boeing at its El Segundo office, while Raytheon Co is slated to host the next event on Dec. 4, also in El Segundo, Espahbodi, a former congressional staff member and Raytheon executive, told Reuters.Espahbodi said Starburst is also working with research centers in other cities, including Wichita, Kansas, Chicago, and Boston to help startups navigate the ""nebulous"" world of procurement. Starburst vets the startups carefully to ensure they have moved beyond ideas to solid intellectual property. Boeing, Panasonic Aviation, Booz Allen Hamilton and other big companies then pay a fee of $100,000 a year for access to the events and one-on-one work with the startup hunters. The companies and investors then decide which startups to help fund.Starburst is focused on commercial aerospace, but plans to move into weapons-related markets as well, particularly given the Pentagon's recent increased focus on innovation and developing ties to Silicon Valley, Espahbodi said. He is due to meet with officials from the White House and Federal Aviation Administration in Washington this week to describe the program.One firm that stood out at the Oct. 2 event was Enduralock, a company founded by a spinal surgeon who has patented a new vibration-resistant fastener technology for use on aircraft, Espahbodi said.Another more ""audacious"" startup, he said, was Natilus, which is developing large, autonomous drones that can deliver cargo, and can fly as low as 80 feet or as high as 40,000 feet. Natilus says the drones could cut the cost of shipping freight by 75 percent.Starburst plans to open another office in Singapore next year, company officials said.

900,"  (Adds Raytheon statement)By Andrea ShalalWASHINGTON Dec 2 The Pentagon's chief arms buyer on Wednesday said he plans another ""deep dive"" review on Friday of a troubled Raytheon Co program to develop ground controls for a new generation of GPS satellites, and could decide to open part of the program to a new competition.Frank Kendall, undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology and logistics, told an industry conference he is ""very worried"" about the software-intensive Raytheon program, which has seen costs rise sharply due to what he called problems with contractor performance and cyber security requirements.The system is critical to the Air Force's ability to operate GPS, or global positioning system, satellites which help the military target weapons strikes, provide critical timing information and also provide critical services for commercial industry.After the speech, Kendall told reporters that Raytheon was nearing completion on some of the work, but said the department was looking at various alternatives, including launching a new competition, to complete the bulk of the work on the program. Kendall carried out a similar review of Raytheon's next-generation GPS Operational Control System, or OCX, earlier this year after its cost soared to $1.6 billion, up 80.5 percent from an initial contract value, and the program's completion was delayed by two years to 2018.The U.S. Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center awarded Raytheon a contract in February 2010 to develop the hardware and software needed to control U.S. GPS satellites and ensure the security of their signals, but the program has run into technical challenges and seen cost increases. Kendall said the program was still experiencing problems but gave no details. The Air Force's former top acquisition official, William LaPlante, told reporters before leaving office that the program was in ""bad"" shape, but did not elaborate.Matt Gilligan, Raytheon's vice president for navigation and environmental solutions, said the program was now on ""a strong foundation"" after completion of a number of critical corrective actions implemented since late 2013.""As a result, this vitally important program is now well positioned for predictable performance and strong execution going forward,"" Gilligan said in a statement. ""Raytheon firmly believes that GPS OCX is the best path forward to meet the country's needs for a completely capable and cyber hardened ground control system and the nation's full modernization requirements without compromise.""The OCX system passed the Pentagon's review last February, but Air Force officials said it would be monitored closely to ensure it stuck to cost and schedule targets.The Pentagon's chief weapons tester warned last January that an operational evaluation of the new ground system would be delayed to early 2019, and said the Air Force would not receive the first control station until after up to eight GPS III satellites were built and launched.Lockheed Martin Corp's program to build the GPS III satellites is back on track after delays involving a sensor built by Exelis Inc, which is now owned by Harris Corp.

901,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force's top space official on Tuesday slammed a new ground control system for GPS satellites being built by Raytheon Co as ""a disaster"" and said the Pentagon planned ""significant"" changes with the company to address the issues.General John Hyten, commander of Air Force Space Command, spoke after attending a session on the program last Friday led by the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, Frank Kendall.Air Force spokeswoman Captain Annmarie Annicelli said the  Air Force would develop new cost estimates for the troubled GPS Operational Control System, or OCX, to reflect an additional two-year delay in completing its development.Air Force officials earlier this year said the program had an 80.5 percent cost increase, to $1.6 billion, and a two-year delay due to increased cyber security requirements and issues with the contractor's performance.Hyten, speaking with reporters after an event, said Raytheon had completed an initial system called Block 0 to launch and fly the satellites, but more sophisticated software was needed to take full advantage of all the GPS signals over the longer term. He said the Air Force initially underestimated the challenge of securing the system from cyber attacks and later had to revise its approach. But he said Raytheon also ""did a really bad job"" of systems engineering before it began developing software code.""The OCX program is a disaster, just a disaster, and it’s embarrassing to have to stand in front of people and try to defend it, so I won't,"" Hyten told the event. ""When you start down a path and you basically can’t deliver and you keep pushing the system out to the right, and you keep pouring money at it, and the contractor does not deliver, you’re in a tough spot."" Matt Gilligan, Raytheon's vice president for navigation and environmental solutions, said the company was focused on continued development of the system.""We are fully committed to delivering, without compromise, the modernized GPS ground controls envisioned and required by the Air Force,"" Gilligan said in a statement to Reuters.Kendall last week told reporters the department was looking at a range of options for the program, including opening part of the work to a new competition. Neither the Pentagon nor the Air Force had any immediate comment on Tuesday on possible further steps to open part of the work to competition. The OCX system is to allow the Air Force to operate its newest GPS III, or global positioning system, satellites to help the military target weapons strikes, provide critical timing information and deliver critical services for industry.Lockheed Martin Corp's program to build the GPS III satellites also ran into trouble, but is back on track after delays involving a sensor built by Exelis Inc, which is now owned by Harris Corp.

902,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The United States and Japan on Tuesday conducted a second successful test of Raytheon Co's new Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block IIA missile that is being jointly developed by the two countries, according to two sources familiar with the test.During the test off the coast of Southern California near Malibu, the missile opened its new sensor seeker in space for the first time and used new altitude control rockets to target a star, said one of the sources, who was not authorized to speak publicly. No intercept was planned for this test and no target missile was launched, but several intercept tests will following in coming years, said the source.The United States spent just over $2 billion on the SM-3 IIA weapons program, while Japan contributed about $1 billion, according to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency.  The new missile is a 21-inch variant of an earlier SM-3 missile and works with the U.S. Aegis combat system built by Lockheed Martin Corp to destroy incoming ballistic missile threats in space.Tuesday's test marked another milestone toward deployment of the missile on U.S. Aegis destroyers and Japan's Kongo ships in coming years, as well as the U.S. Aegis Ashore site in Poland in 2018. The test also validated the new sensor seeker developed for the redesigned kill vehicle, or warhead, that will eventually replace the ones now used on the U.S. fleet of ground-based interceptors in Alaska and California that are part of the U.S. homeland missile defense system, the sources said.Neither Raytheon nor the U.S. Missile Defense Agency had any immediate comment. Raytheon's new SM-3 IIA missile has bigger rocket motors and a more capable kill vehicle that would allow the missile to engage threats sooner and protect larger regions from short- to intermediate-range ballistic missile threats.On Tuesday, the Pentagon announced that Raytheon was awarded a contract for more than $543 million for 17 SM-3 IIA missiles.

Air Force officials earlier this year said the program had an 80.5 percent cost increase, to $1.6 billion, and a two-year delay due to increased cyber security requirements and issues with the contractor's performance.Hyten, speaking with reporters after an event, said Raytheon had completed an initial system called Block 0 to launch and fly the satellites, but more sophisticated software was needed to take full advantage of all the GPS signals over the longer term.He said the Air Force initially underestimated the challenge of securing the system from cyber attacks and later had to revise its approach. But he said Raytheon also ""did a really bad job"" of systems engineering before it began developing software code. ""The OCX program is a disaster, just a disaster, and it's embarrassing to have to stand in front of people and try to defend it, so I won't,"" Hyten told the event. ""When you start down a path and you basically can't deliver and you keep pushing the system out to the right, and you keep pouring money at it, and the contractor does not deliver, you're in a tough spot.""Matt Gilligan, Raytheon's vice president for navigation and environmental solutions, said the company was focused on continued development of the system. ""We are fully committed to delivering, without compromise, the modernized GPS ground controls envisioned and required by the Air Force,"" Gilligan said in a statement to Reuters.Kendall last week told reporters the department was looking at a range of options for the program, including opening part of the work to a new competition. Neither the Pentagon nor the Air Force had any immediate comment on Tuesday on possible further steps to open part of the work to competition.The OCX system is to allow the Air Force to operate its newest GPS III, or global positioning system, satellites to help the military target weapons strikes, provide critical timing information and deliver critical services for industry.Lockheed Martin Corp's program to build the GPS III satellites also ran into trouble, but is back on track after delays involving a sensor built by Exelis Inc, which is now owned by Harris Corp.

916,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force will continue work on an alternative ground control program and explore outside options to hedge against further cost spikes and delays on Raytheon Co's (RTN.N) troubled ground control system for next-generation GPS satellites, according to an Air Force document seen by Reuters.The Air Force on Tuesday said a ""deep dive"" review led by the Pentagon's chief arms buyer last week resulted in a further two-year delay in completion of the Raytheon program and potential cost increases, but gave no additional details.The delays and cost increases are the latest troubles facing a program slammed as ""a disaster"" on Tuesday by General John Hyten, commander of Air Force Space Command. Raytheon won a contract worth up to $1.5 billion in 2010 to develop the GPS Operational Control System, or OCX, to operate the next generation GPS 3 satellites being built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N). By December 2014, the program's projected cost had soared to $3.6 billion, including inflation, due to increased cyber security requirements and poor contractor performance, according to Air Force and Pentagon officials.Earlier this month, Air Force officials estimated that the program could require an additional 47-month delay that could send its total cost, including inflation, as high as $5.6 billion, according to a source familiar with the issue.  However, officials agreed at Friday's deep-dive review to stretch the program only for 24 months, which should result in a smaller cost increase, said the source, who expressed continued skepticism despite the belief of some Air Force officials that the program was now beyond the worst of its problems.""This program is a big mess and there aren't any good options in terms of how to fix it,"" said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Starting from scratch with a new contractor would take too long, the source added, but the current plan meant that the Air Force would be unable to test or use the full capabilities of its new GPS 3 satellites for years after they were launched. Needed cyber security protections would also be delayed. At Friday's review, officials agreed to expand oversight of the program; institute quarterly reviews by the Pentagon's top acquisition official, Frank Kendall, and Raytheon Chief Executive Tom Kennedy; and expedite contingency plans meant to ensure the older GPS ground control system could be used to operate the new GPS 3 satellites until the new system was done.The Air Force also agreed to continue work on an alternative ground control system and explore options outside the OCX program, including adding military code functions to other systems, to hedge against further cost growth and delays. Air Force officials had no immediate comment on the additional, previously unreported, plans for the program, or the cost estimates prepared earlier this month. Raytheon declined to comment.The company is now expected to complete work on the OCX system by July 2022, two years later than expected in a revamped baseline established in October, the document showed.The longer 47-month delay would have increased the program's cost by over 30 percent from its current baseline, or 50 percent above the initial plan, triggering a live-or-die review of the program required under the Nunn-McCurdy law, the document said. It said it was uncertain if the shorter delay would also trigger such a review.

917,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON The U.S. Air Force plans to revise its contract with Raytheon Co (RTN.N) for a new ground control network for GPS satellites after officials decided last week to delay completion of the program until July 2022, a senior official said Thursday.Major General Roger Teague, director of space programs for the Air Force's acquisition chief, told Reuters in an interview it was not clear how much the delay would add to the program, which was previously expected to cost $3.6 billion.He said the GPS program office would also review incentive fees associated with the contract to ensure they properly rewarded good performance and penalized the company if its performance did not improve.Raytheon has said it was committed to meeting the Air Force's expectations for the program, but declined to give any further details.Teague's comments followed a ""deep dive"" review last week by the Pentagon's chief arms buyer, Frank Kendall, of the troubled program, which was slammed as ""a disaster"" on Tuesday by General John Hyten, commander of Air Force Space Command. Raytheon won a contract worth up to $1.5 billion in 2010 to develop the GPS Operational Control System, or OCX, to operate the next-generation GPS 3 satellites being built by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N).The project's cost had already more than doubled due to increased cyber security requirements and poor contractor performance, and now looks likely to rise further.Teague confirmed that Air Force officials initially estimated a delay of 47 additional months, first reported by Reuters on Wednesday.. He said Kendall opted for a shorter delay, coupled with aggressive oversight at all levels of the program, to ensure that the sorely-needed satellite control capability was delivered to the military.Teague said a new cost estimate would be done early next year, with Kendall and Raytheon Chief Executive Tom Kennedy to set meet for another quarterly ""deep dive"" review in early spring. Teague said Lieutenant General Samuel Greaves, commander of U.S. Space and Missiles Systems Center, would now meet weekly with a Raytheon vice president about the program, while Lieutenant Arnold Bunch, the top Air Force officer in charge of acquisition, would participate on a biweekly basis.Kendall decided not to restructure the contract as a fixed-price program because it would have reduced the government's oversight, Teague said. ""It's a team sport,"" he said.

The U.S. government approved PAC-3 missile sales worth up to $1.41 billion with South Korea in November 2014, and the sale to Qatar of PAC-3 missiles in November 2012.Other countries that have ordered the Lockheed missile include the United States, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Taiwan and Kuwait. Scott Arnold, Lockheed's vice president of PAC-3 programs,  welcomed the news and said the company's missile defense interceptors utilized advanced technology that enabled ""better accuracy, enhanced safety and improved reliability when it matters most.”The PAC-3 Missile is a high-velocity interceptor that defends against incoming threats including tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft.  Lockheed said the PAC-3 MSE missile uses a two-pulse solid rocket motor that increases altitude and range to meet evolving threats.

938,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON  WASHINGTON Boeing Co said on Friday it would test additional improvements to its ground-based U.S. missile defense system later this year during a first test of the system's ability to intercept an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM.The U.S. Missile Defense Agency on Thursday conducted a successful non-intercept test aimed at demonstrating the effectiveness of a redesigned ""kill vehicle,"" or warhead, built by Raytheon Co.Missile Defense Agency Director James Syring told the Center for International and Strategic Studies last week that the ICBM intercept test, which will include countermeasures, would take place before the end of the year as part of a broad effort to improve the Ground-Base Midcourse Defense System, or GMD.The United States has been developing the $41 billion weapons system to defeat the long-ranges and high velocities of an ICBM like those being developed by North Korea and Iran. It previously tested and intercepted dummy missiles that simulated short and medium-range ballistic missiles. The MDA is racing to improve the system after it failed to hit a dummy missile in five of eight tests conducted after the Bush administration rushed to deploy the system in 2004 to counter growing threats by North Korea. Boeing Vice President Norm Tew said the ICBM intercept test would include new technologies infused into the booster used to launch the ground-based interceptors, and other measures aimed at improving the reliability of the exoatmospheric kill vehicle (EKV), or warhead, designed by Raytheon Co. Boeing, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Corp are developing a redesigned kill vehicle for the interceptors, due to have its first flight test in 2018.Tew said he could not comment about whether the U.S. military was considering adding 10 ground-based interceptors to the three now in place at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The U.S. military is already adding 14 interceptors to the 27 interceptors in place at a second site in Alaska. ""There are a lot of things being considered,"" Tew said, noting that the Obama administration was evaluating possible missile defense sites in the northeastern United States.

It could eventually buy up to 600 planes, analysts said. Raytheon and Finmeccanica said using an existing aircraft instead of designing a new one would save the Air Force money, and could allow the planes to enter into service years before the target of 2024.Unlike other contenders, the M-346 aircraft had already demonstrated its capabilities for U.S. Air Force officials in Italy in 2014 as they were finalizing their requirements for the new training planes, officials from the companies said.The planes are already being used to train Israeli, Italian and Dutch pilots who will fly Lockheed F-35 fighter jets.

947,"  WARSAW Poland has relaunched talks with Lockheed Martin's MEADS on a medium-range air- and missile-defense system, the deputy defense minister was quoted as saying in comments published on Thursday.The tender, whose value defense officials estimate at around $5 billion, is central to Warsaw's large-scale army modernization program, speeded up in response to the Ukraine crisis and Russia's renewed assertiveness in the region. Poland had previously excluded the U.S. Lockheed-led consortium from the tender, short-listing two contenders: a consortium of European group MBDA and France's Thales SA, and U.S. firm Raytheon Co, as potential suppliers.Last year, Poland's former center-right government announced it would purchase Raytheon's Patriot system, a decision which the Law and Justice (PiS) party, then in opposition but now in government, said it would review should it come to power.Speaking to Reuters shortly before the election, Bartosz Kownacki, who went on to become deputy defense minister in charge of army modernization, said a PiS government would reconsider Lockheed's offer as a cheaper option. Following PiS' decisive election victory in October, the conservatives challenged the deal, questioning the ""original cost and timeline assumptions of Raytheon's offer, as well as those regarding the scope of (U.S.) cooperation with Polish industry"" - a reference to how many of the jobs involved might go to Poles, and to potential technology sharing.""We're relaunching talks with MEADS,"" daily Dziennik Gazeta Prawna quoted Kownacki as saying in a report published on Thursday.""We're still discussing who will be the supplier of the missile defense ... solution. Various options and various suppliers are possible. It all depends on the conditions which will be offered to us,"" Kownacki said. ""We have always maintained that our previous MEADS offer for the ... program remains valid,"" said Marty Coyne, MEADS director of business development in a statement sent to Reuters.Raytheon said it was supporting the negotiations between Washington and Warsaw regarding the sale of the Patriot system, and was in discussion with the Polish defense industry on technology transfer and jobs. ""Raytheon has a proven track record of successfully meeting offset obligations and placing work in country,"" it said in a statement sent to Reuters.Earlier this month, Kownacki said that Raytheon's Patriot remained Poland's first choice in the tender, but only if the price was lowered and Poland could access certain U.S. defense technologies.

953,"   By Jonathan Stempel  Raytheon Co must defend against a $1 billion whistleblower lawsuit accusing the defense contractor of fraudulently overbilling the U.S. government under a contract to develop a weather sensor for a costly environmental satellite system, an appeals court ruled on Monday.    By a 3-0 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena, California said an engineer, Steven Mateski, could pursue claims that Raytheon violated the federal False Claims Act for at least a decade starting in 2002.The court said Mateski's claims went beyond publicly disclosed problems in developing the National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, which suffered from delays and cost overruns, including problems outlined in a U.S. Government Accountability Office report from November 2005.""If his allegations prove to be true, Mateski will undoubtedly have been one of those whistle-blowing insiders with genuinely valuable information, rather than an opportunistic plaintiff who has no significant information to contribute,"" Circuit Judge Michelle Friedland wrote for the appeals court.A spokesman for Raytheon had no immediate comment on the decision. The company is based in Waltham, Massachusetts. Allan Graf, a lawyer for Mateski, said his client was grateful for the decision.Mateski's allegation was that Raytheon, his employer from 1997 to 2006, mismanaged its subcontract to develop the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite sensor for the NPOESS, on which Northrop Grumman Corp held the main contract. Friedland said it would be unfair to the government and whistleblowers to impose a ""public disclosure bar"" against False Claims Act lawsuits such as Mateski's that identified ""specific instances of fraud,"" where public documents such as the GAO report merely described ""problems"" or even ""generalized fraud.""Monday's decision overturned U.S. District Judge Otis Wright's February 2013 dismissal of the lawsuit, and returned the case to his Los Angeles courtroom.

961,"   By Andrea Shalal | WASHINGTON, March 24  WASHINGTON, March 24 The Pentagon on Thursday said the estimated cost of Raytheon Co's ground control system for next-generation GPS satellites rose 16.3 percent to $4.2 billion in 2015 - even before a two-year delay decision that will add more cost.The Raytheon GPS Operational Control System (OCX) - dubbed the Air Force's ""No. 1 troubled program"" by a top general last month - is now forecast to cost $586.4 million more than the $3.6 billion previously expected.The new estimate is 180 percent over the $1.5 billion value of the contract when it was first awarded to Raytheon in 2010. Costs have soared due to technical issues related to tough cyber requirements, and poor performance, according to Pentagon officials.Air Force spokeswoman Captain Annmarie Annicelli said the new Pentagon estimate reflected cost growth and schedule delays reported during a February 2015 program review, but not further cost overruns and delays that triggered tough program reviews by Pentagon officials in December 2015 and March 2016. The Pentagon's chief arms buyer, Frank Kendall, decided in December to delay the program's completion by two years, a move that is expected to further increase the cost of the program.Annicelli said the Air Force was still assessing the impact of those changes and had not yet released a new cost estimate. The Defense Department is due to conduct another comprehensive review of the long-delayed system in about three months together with Raytheon Chief Executive Tom Kennedy.Lieutenant General Samuel Greaves, who heads the Air Force's Space and Missile Systems Center, last month described OCX program as the Air Force's ""No. 1 troubled program."" He said the Air Force was exploring alternatives, including with Lockheed Martin Corp, which builds the newest GPS satellites. The Raytheon program could be canceled if the company did not improve its performance, he said at the time.U.S. military officials have thus far stopped short of canceling the OCX program, citing the importance of the system at a time when China, Russia, Iran and other countries are aggressively attacking U.S. military systems such as GPS.OCX will be the first satellite control system designed after the advent of significant jamming and other cyber threats.

990,"   By Idrees Ali  Raytheon Co (RTN.N), the maker of Patriot missile systems, reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue as sales of its Paveway smart bombs increased. The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company's shares rose 2.4 percent to $138.60 in premarket trading on Thursday. Raytheon also raised its 2016 forecast for earnings from continuing operations, partly due to a lower tax rate and fall in interest expenses.The company benefited from a big backlog from previous years, mainly in missile systems and space and airborne systems, Chief Financial Officer Toby O'Brien told Reuters. Sales in Raytheon's missile systems unit, its biggest business, increased 6 percent in the second quarter. The business, which makes laser- and GPS-guided smart bombs, accounted for more than a quarter of the company's total revenue.  Sales rose 9.3 percent in the space and airborne systems business, which makes tracking, targeting and navigation sensors for aircraft, drones and missiles, helped by higher revenue from classified programs. O'Brien said Raytheon got nearly a third of its sales from clients outside the United States. Of this, about half came from the Middle East and Africa regions. He said weak oil prices did not hurt the company's business in the Middle East. ""Our customers in that region are spending from a defense point of view on high priority areas that protect both their sovereignty and their citizens,"" O'Brien said.  Raytheon raised its full-year earnings forecast to $7.13-$7.33 per share from $6.93-$7.13, leaving its net sales forecast unchanged at $24 billion-$24.5 billion.Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $7.18 per share and revenue of $24.42 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Raytheon could win a contract by late 2017 from the Polish government, if Poland and the United States reach an agreement on the Patriot missile defense system by the end of this year, O'Brien said.

991,"   By Tim Kelly and Nobuhiro Kubo | TOKYO  TOKYO Japan is upgrading its Patriot PAC-3 missile defense system in time for the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, adding range and accuracy needed to intercept more advanced North Korean ballistic missiles, four sources with knowledge of the plan said.The move represents the most significant upgrade to Japan's missile defense system in a decade and is part of an increase in military spending in the region, where geopolitical tensions are rising. The rollout of the new advanced Missile Segment Enhancement, which could double the range of the current PAC-3 missiles to around 30 km (19 miles), will likely start next year, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the project. ""The upgraded PAC-3 is necessary to counter the Musudan,"" said one source, referring to Pyongyang's intermediate-range ballistic missile. North Korea in June test-fired what appeared to be two Musudan rockets. The first failed, but the second traveled 400 km (250 miles), more than halfway towards the southwest coast of Japan and reached a height of 1,000 km - enough altitude to give its warhead a range of more than 3,000 km (1,800 miles).Experts said that test represented a technological advance for the Pyongyang regime, which is also developing nuclear weapons. It puts it one step closer to being able to lob a warhead that could plunge to its target at speeds of several kilometers a second, potentially too fast for the current PAC-3 batteries that are the last line of defense against missile strikes.South Korea's military operates the older PAC-2 system and has a program to replace it with the PAC-3 system by 2018, a South Korean defense ministry official said. U.S. forces based in the country were also planning to upgrade their PAC-3 batteries covering the capital Seoul, the official added.  RISING TENSIONS  Along with North Korea's missile and nuclear tests, tensions in Asia are being fueled by ongoing territorial disputes between China and Japan in the East China Sea, and between China and several Southeast Asian nations in the South China Sea. China is swiftly modernizing its armed forces, in part to counter what it sees as a strategy of containment in the United States' Asian ""pivot"".A spokesman for Japan's Defence Ministry said ""nothing has been decided"" on the PAC-3 upgrade. The International Olympic Committee's decision to grant Tokyo the 2020 games will help unlock funding for the PAC-3 upgrade despite military budget constraints, the sources told Reuters. Around 100 billion yen ($955 million) in funding would be requested in the next defense budget proposal for the year starting April 2017, one of the sources said. Funding will need cabinet approval before going into the national budget and additional funds would have to be approved for subsequent years.Japan is also considering purchasing the advanced Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, anti-missile system, which Washington and Seoul agreed to deploy in South Korea earlier this month. That decision sparked a complaint from China, which said it would destabilize the regional security balance.The Patriot upgrade would likely be an enhancement to Japan's ballistic missile defense, rather than an alternative to THAAD or a similar system. Japan also has Aegis-equipped destroyers patrolling the Sea of Japan that are loaded with interceptor missiles designed to hit incoming projectiles. It is currently developing a new version dubbed the Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) with the United States designed to destroy ballistic warheads in space, although no decision on a roll out has yet been made.The PAC-3 system was developed by Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co. Japan's biggest defense contractor, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), will begin work on Japan's systems under license after April next year, the sources said.MHI will upgrade 12 batteries in the first year, another 12 the following year with four in the subsequent twelve months, the sources said. Those guarding the Tokyo area will take priority and some used for training will not be upgraded.""The Ministry of Defence has not made any announcement regarding this, so as a commercial company we are not in a position to comment,"" a MHI spokeswoman said.Raytheon did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a Lockheed spokeswoman said the company had ""a long and successful history of working with Japanese industry in their production of the PAC-3 missile system under license”.

1012,"   By Andrea Shalal and Sabine Siebold | BERLIN  BERLIN U.S. weapons maker Raytheon Co said on Friday it could start upgrading Germany's Patriot missile defense system in about a year if Berlin decides against a rival system built by Europe's MBDA and U.S.-based Lockheed Martin Corp.Wes Kremer, who heads Raytheon's Integrated Defense Systems division, said the company could also upgrade Germany's Patriot system for less than the estimated cost of the rival Medium Extended Air Defense System (MEADS), made by MBDA and Lockheed,.Raytheon lost out on the work last year when Germany picked the MEADS system, but the company is keeping close tabs on the defense ministry's slow-moving efforts to hammer out a contract with MBDA.Sources familiar with the matter say the MBDA's formal proposal for the program came in billions of euros higher than the previous estimate of 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) when it was submitted in September. Some ministry officials have already raised the possibility of upgrading Patriot given the jump in the MEADS projected cost, the sources said. ""They refer to us as the Plan B,"" Kremer told Reuters in an interview during a visit to Berlin. ""I'm confident we can do it for much less than the MEADS budget.""Raytheon argues that upgrading the Patriot system would save Germany money in the short and long term, allowing it to continue to benefit from upgrades and reliability improvements funded by all 13 countries that operate the system. If Berlin stuck with the MEADS system, it alone would be responsible for all such modifications and updates, Kremer said.""Europe and NATO is about pooling resources and pooling money to work together ... and Patriot really is the epitome of that,"" he said.The MEADS system was developed jointly by Germany, Italy and the United States over the last decade, although the U.S. Army later decided not to buy the system for its own use.  The German defense ministry says it is still reviewing the bid submitted by MBDA, jointly owned by Airbus Group, Britain's BAE Systems Plc and Italy's Leonardo Finmeccanica SpA. MBDA has declined to comment.Kremer said Germany could quickly upgrade the capability of its Patriot system to match upgrades now being carried out by the United States. Berlin could later acquire a 360-degree radar that is to be developed as part of a separate program for which Raytheon is bidding in Poland. That radar system would take about five years to complete, he said. MEADS, which is also vying for the Polish work, includes a 360-degree radar system that has already been developed and tested.Kremer, who met with Polish officials in Warsaw this week, said he remained confident Raytheon and the U.S. government would eventually complete a contract with Poland despite Warsaw's decision to continue talks with Lockheed about MEADS.He declined to estimate when the agreement could be completed.Kremer said Raytheon had made good progress in working out arrangements for at least 50 percent of the work to be carried out in Poland. ""We are on a path to closure for this,"" he said.

Poland asked Washington in September for approval to buy the systems, aiming to close a $5 billion deal that is central to a thorough modernization of its armed forces by 2023. As advanced military technology, special permission must be obtained from the U.S. government for purchase.     ""Concrete decisions are expected within the next few months,"" John Baird, vice president of Raytheon Poland programs, told the private Newseria Biznes agency.Poland is also in talks with Lockhead Martin's MEADS joint venture regarding the acquisition of Medium Extended Air Defense Systems (MEADS).
