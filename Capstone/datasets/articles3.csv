""If we're looking at headwinds like currency and slowing global growth, seeing multinationals like Caterpillar and 3M post solid beats gives us confidence that economic growth is holding on and probably better than the market is currently expecting,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York.With 177 of the S&P 500 companies having posted third-quarter results, 69.5 percent have beaten expectations, better than the 67 percent beat rate over the past four quarters, and higher than the 20-year average of 63 percent, Thomson Reuters data show.The surge on Wall Street helped turn around European stocks, which initially fell on weak results from some companies, including French tire-maker Michelin, despite support from better-than-expected euro zone business activity data.

36,"  * Risk sentiment hit by first Ebola case in NY* Caterpillar, 3M earnings underpin sentiment* U.S. and euro zone economic data positive* European shares seen falling 0.5-0.7 pctBy Hideyuki SanoTOKYO, Oct 24 U.S. stock futures tumbled while safe-haven assets such as the yen and U.S. bonds gained on Friday after a doctor who returned to New York City from West Africa tested positive for Ebola.S&P 500 mini futures fell as much as 0.7 percent, slipping from two-week highs hit the previous day on budding optimism from corporate earnings and the global economy.European shares looked set to slip, with France's CAC 40 seen falling by as much as 0.7 percent and Germany's DAX  and Britain's FTSE by 0.5 percent.In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.1 percent, though Japan's Nikkei share average bucked the trend rising 1.0 percent, led by gains in drug companies.""Just when markets got some relief on the world economy, we had this news. Obviously people who have just made bullish bets (on the economy) will close their positions as no one can tell exactly what is going to happen,"" said the head of currency trading at a Western bank's Tokyo branch. The first diagnosed case of Ebola in the world financial hub of New York sent investors rushing to traditional safe-haven assets.As U.S. bond prices gained, the 10-year U.S. yield fell back to 2.250 percent from Thursday's two-week high of 2.300 percent .In the currency market, the yen gained 0.3 percent to 107.95 yen to the dollar.Risk asset prices had risen on Thursday after upbeat U.S. corporate earnings, solid U.S. economic data, and an unexpected uptick in euro zone business sentiment helped ease concerns that the global economy was losing momentum.Results from Caterpillar Inc and 3M Co  reassured investors that companies with large overseas revenue streams could deliver solid profits, despite concerns about global economic growth. The markets had ignored positive earnings earlier this month, when the world's share prices hit multi-month lows, overwhelmed by fears that sluggishness in Europe and Asia could deal a severe blow to the U.S. economy as well.But a steady flow of solid earnings helped to ease many such concerns for now.With 177 of the S&P 500 companies having posted third-quarter results, 69.5 percent have beaten expectations, better than the 67 percent beat rate over the past four quarters, and higher than the 20-year average of 63 percent, Thomson Reuters data showed.New claims for U.S. unemployment benefits also held below 300,000 for a sixth straight week last week. In the euro zone, a survey showed businesses performed much better than anyone expected this month, even though it also pointed to strong deflationary pressure in the region.The euro drew some support from the surprise strength in the euro zone data, but was still near a two-week low of $1.2614 hit on Thursday. It last stood at $1.2657.Investors are turning cautious ahead of Sunday's release of the European Central Bank's stress test results on the euro zone's 130 biggest banks.In addition, some focus could fall on the parliamentary election in Ukraine on Sunday. Stability could benefit the European economy, which has suffered from the fall in trade with Russia on tit-for-tat sanctions between the West and Moscow.""I suspect one often overlooked reason for the market's rebound since the middle of this week was signs of easing tensions between Russia and Ukraine,"" said Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at Daiwa SB Investments, pointing to progress in gas talks between Russia and Ukraine last week.President Petro Poroshenko's bloc holds a big lead, but if the populist Oleh Lyashko's Radical party makes a very strong showing, Poroshenko may have the awkward task of seeking the support of a politician who has been sharply critical of his peace plan and his contacts with Russian President Vladimir Putin.Sunday will also see presidential election in Brazil, where stocks and the currency have suffered on expectations that the current President Dilma Rousseff is likely to beat her rival, Aecio Neves, who is seen as more market-friendly.The Bovespa stock index hit a six-month low while the Brazilian real slumped to a 9-1/2-year low on Thursday.(Editing by Eric Meijer)",2014-10-24,MMM,"Fri Oct 24, 2014 | 2:24am EDT",GLOBAL MARKETS-U.S. stock futures tumble on reports of NY Ebola case,http://www.reuters.com//article/markets-global-idUSL3N0SJ03820141024?type=companyNews

Asahi Kasei will acquire all outstanding shares of Polypore for $60.50 a share, a 14 percent premium to their $52.95 close on Friday and representing an enterprise value of about $3.2 billion.Polypore's shares rose as high as $59.81 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.Before the acquisition, 3M Co will buy the assets of Polypore's separations media business for about $1 billion and Asahi Kasei will receive the cash proceeds from the sale. {ID:nBw9J4bP2a] ""With a high level of overlap with 3M's existing business, we would expect the deal to generate synergies and to expand 3M's presence in relatively fast-growing markets with high barriers to entry,"" Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Steven Winoker wrote in a client note.Polypore's separation media business, which makes microporous membranes and filtration modules, will be merged with 3M's purification business.The U.S. company, known for its Post-It notes, said it expected Polypore's business to add 4 cents per share to earnings, excluding one-time items, in the first year. Polypore's energy storage operation achieved sales of $442 million and EBITDA of $116 million in 2013, Asahi Kasei said.Asked about possibility of further acquisitions, Asano said: ""We would like to actively pursue (acquisitions) where there is a big strategic fit.""Asahi Kasei said it would draw on its cash reserves and new bridging loans. Primary Executive Officer Hideki Kobori said the company was not considering issuing equity or bonds to finance the acquisition.The transactions have been approved by the boards of directors of Asahi Kasei, 3M and Polypore.Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities Co was financial adviser to Asahi Kasei, while Bank of America Merrill Lynch advised Polypore.

The new paper-sourcing policy, aimed at preventing the destruction of forests, comes after pressure on 3M from environmental activists, who accused the company of outdated practices that jeopardized fragile forests.The company, which also manufacturers Scotch brand tape products, will now require some 5,000 direct suppliers, located in more than 70 countries, to provide data, including the source of their harvested wood fiber. The company says it may sever ties with suppliers that fail to meet its standards.While other companies have also set conservation standards for their suppliers, 3M's action is expected to have broad ripple effects, because of the size of its supply network, said Todd Paglia, executive director at ForestEthics, a forest and climate advocacy organization.ForestEthics, which led a campaign against 3M, is now applauding the company's new standards.""No other manufacturer has adopted such a rigorous policy with such reach around the world,"" Paglia said. 3M is the latest company to take voluntary steps to reform its supply chain practices amid pressure from environmental groups. In January, Wilmar International Ltd (WLIL.SI), the  world's largest palm oil processor, opened its supply chains to outside scrutiny in what environmentalists called an unprecedented step to help safeguard tropical forests.Under 3M's policy, all paper-based products and packaging suppliers will be expected to harvest in ways that don't threaten peatland ecosystems and intact forest landscapes. The policy also aims to protect dense, high-carbon stock forests and ensure the rights of indigenous peoples.The company said it developed its policy in collaboration with environmental groups. The company is working with a non-profit agency, The Forest Trust, to help make sure suppliers are not running afoul of conservation standards. Greenpeace has also hailed the new policy. The company is in the process of reviewing its suppliers and says it will issue its first public progress report in May. ""We are taking responsibility for making sure our pulp and paper suppliers meet the requirements of the policy, and help them to raise their performance if necessary,"" said Jean Sweeney, 3M's vice president of environmental, health, safety and sustainability operationsThe company also has created positions in each of its four regions around the world to oversee implementation of the paper-sourcing policy.The costs of implementing the policy are immaterial to earnings, according to 3M, which reported $31.8 billion in sales last year.

49,"  MOSCOW, March 26 Russian consumer electronics retailer M.video may shut more stores in 2015 than last year while opening fewer new outlets, it said on Thursday, as consumer demand shrinks in the weakening economy.The company got a boost in December when the rouble dropped sharply and consumers rushed to buy home appliances and cars to protect savings. The buying spree has proved short-lived though and retailers of durable goods are now facing a slump in demand.M.video plans to open up to 25 stores this year and could close up to 10, chief executive and biggest shareholder Alexander Tynkovan said on a conference call.Last year, it opened 39 while closing four and its capital expenditure stood at 4.3 billion roubles ($75 million). ""Our feeling is that this year there could be some reduction of the market,"" Tynkovan said, adding that M.video, which ended 2014 with a net cash position of 26 billion roubles ($454 million), still hoped to gain market share from weaker competitors.""Some companies already stepped away from this business at the beginning of this year and we expect that others can also reduce their operations. We are going to use this opportunity to increase our market share - it's our main, main focus,"" he said. Tynkovan said 2015 capex would not exceed last year's level. He gave no revenue guidance but said the company remained committed to paying 60 percent of net profit in dividends. M.video had earlier on Thursday reported a 39 percent jump in 2014 net profit and a 16 percent rise in sales to 203 billion roubles.""The results are not of much relevance and cannot be extrapolated to 2015.

50,"  (Adds events for Verizon, AT&T, Canadian National Railway and Rogers Communications)Week AheadA slew of Dow 30 companies report results in the week: Chemicals conglomerate DuPont, industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp, property and casualty insurer Travelers Companies Inc and wireless carrier Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday; McDonald's Corp, AT&T Inc, Boeing Co and Coca-Cola Co on Wednesday; and diversified manufacturer 3M Co, Procter & Gamble and Microsoft Corp on Thursday. While DuPont is expected to report lower first-quarter results, Travelers Companies Inc's first-quarter results are expected to be in line with estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Investors will keep an eye out for details on Verizon's upcoming mobile video service and capital expenditure range and will look for updates on AT&T's proposed $48.5 billion deal to buy DirectTV, which is under regulatory review. Boeing faces fears of an aircraft downturn after it booked record orders in 2014, while Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's new CEO, is charged with reviving the company's falling sales and managing negative PR around the healthiness of its food. Investors will be watching the impact of the strong dollar on 3M's first-quarter results and Microsoft is expected to report sharply lower profit for its third quarter as sales of personal computers remain soggy.Search engine giant Google Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue slightly below analysts' estimate on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Google, which has been officially charged of cheating consumers and competitors by the European Union, is also being investigated for its Android mobile operating system. Analysts say the latter could prove a bigger threat to Google's future profitability. Analysts expect foreign exchange to negatively impact revenues in the first quarter even as paid click growth is poised to decelerate again.Facebook Inc is expected to post a first-quarter profit above Wall Street's expectations on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The world's largest social network's business has been booming thanks to its mobile ads on smartphones and tablets. Many investors also expect that video ads will provide the company's next leg of growth. Facebook has also been stepping up efforts to expand products like messaging service WhatsApp and photo-sharing service Instagram. Investors will be looking out for the company's outlook for the remainder of 2015.On Thursday, the e-commerce company Amazon.com Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue largely in line with analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. However, analysts are expecting margins to improve as the company gets a grip on a slew of investments on everything from Hollywood-style television productions to cloud computing and consumer devices.On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc is expected to report first-quarter revenue in line with analysts' estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data, as its overall share of U.S. desktop searches declines. Analysts and investors will be looking out for any details on the tax-free sale of its Alibaba shares.General Motors Co reports first-quarter results before the market opens on Thursday. Analysts are expecting 96 cents per share, up sharply from a year before.On Wednesday, chipmaker Qualcomm Inc is likely to report second-quarter revenue and profit broadly in line with analysts' average estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Qualcomm lowered its outlook for fiscal 2015 in January, saying it did not expect its newest Snapdragon mobile chip to be used in a major customer's flagship smartphone. Samsung opted for its own mobile processor and modem chip in the Galaxy S6 instead of equivalents from Qualcomm. The chipmaker had also warned that ""challenges"" with another of its chips had hurt its competitiveness in China. Qualcomm recently came under pressure from hedge fund Jana Partners to spin off its chip business from its patent-licensing business.Credit Suisse reports earnings for the first three months of 2015 on Tuesday. Meanwhile, on Friday the Swiss bank will ask shareholders to sign off in a symbolic vote on executive pay for 2014, when Credit Suisse became the largest bank in decades to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge and will pay more than $2.5 billion in penalties for helping Americans evade taxes.Investors will focus on existing home sales on Wednesday, which is expected to have increased 3.0 percent to an annual rate of 5.05 million units. Also, data for new home sales is expected to be released on Thursday. On Friday, the U.S. Commerce Department releases data for durable goods.Starbucks Corp reports its second-quarter results on Thursday. Starbucks is one of the restaurant industry's top performers, but investors and analysts worry that its streak of red-hot growth is coming to an end. The company has a variety of plans in place to boost sales (adding booze, smoothies, more lunch and dinner options, improving and expanding tea selections and testing delivery) and investors will be looking for proof that those are working.On Tuesday, Yum Brands Inc will report its first-quarter results. Yum's China business remains in the spotlight as it fights to recover from the latest food scandal in its biggest market. Analysts say the company is suffering from ""brand fatigue"" in China, where competition is mounting and its image has been hurt by food scares that have raised doubts over its supply chain.Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is slated to announce results for the first quarter on Tuesday. Chipotle is still having problems finding pork suppliers to replace the one it suspended for running afoul of its animal welfare rules.

58,"   By Lewis Krauskopf | ST. PAUL, Minn.  ST. PAUL, Minn. At a time when many companies are investing a smaller portion of revenues in research and development, 3M Co has given Chief Technology Officer Ashish Khandpur more to spend, and he is aiming at bigger targets.Khandpur, a 20-year 3M veteran and chemical engineer who holds patents related to pressure-sensitive adhesives, is helping oversee a push to expand R&D spending to about 6 percent of revenue by 2017 from about 5.5 percent in 2012. That equates to about $160 million in additional spending annually. In an interview with Reuters, Khandpur said the fresh money will be used to develop ""disruptive platforms"", which can yield products that are sold into multiple markets and can change the competitive landscape.""Each of these platforms we have funded is a several hundred million dollar opportunity at maturity,"" he said at 3M’s St. Paul headquarters campus. It was his first interview since assuming his post in July.So far, 3M, which posted $31.8 billion in revenue last year, says it has 30 such programs in various stages of development, with $250 million in sales expected this year from those already commercialized. Khandpur pointed to Crystal Silk, a new surface material that is smooth to the touch, yet also designed to be scratch- and stain-resistant. It is used for computer touchpads, a new market for 3M, and also could have applications in appliances and other areas. 3M is bucking the trend with its plans to crank up R&D spending. Consulting firm Strategy& says annual R&D spending as a percentage of revenue among the world's 1,000 largest R&D spenders fell from 4.2 percent in 2005 to 3.5 percent in 2014. R&D spending did rise in absolute terms over that time.Already, 3M invests more than double the average 2.3 percent spent last year by 190 industrial companies tracked by Strategy&. Of other large industrial companies, United Technologies reported spending 4.1 percent of revenue on R&D in 2014, while General Electric's research budget amounted to 4.8 percent of its industrial revenue. For GE, that budget compares to 5.3 percent in 2013, and 5.1 percent in 2012.""Businesses, just because they are under pressure quarter-to-quarter of delivering their numbers, can get operational at times,"" said Khandpur, 47. ""We want to make sure that as a company we don’t fall into that trap and we are able to fund big programs.""Analysts are watching 3M's R&D spending to see if the company can deliver products with higher pricing and margins. ""If R&D productivity is poor, that’s a huge disappointment,"" Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said. ""Not only does it imply your pace of growth could slow, but it’s also going to be a drag because it’s significant money spent.""Khandpur says 3M is taking steps to improve its chances of delivering significant new products, such as sharpening the individual focus of its 85 labs in 37 countries.The technology chief leads a monthly meeting of nine executives that recommends which major research programs the manufacturer should pursue, and which it should drop. 3M is also expanding efforts to get outside ideas. The company has roughly 50 technical centers globally that are designed to expose customers to 3M’s technology. In March, 3M unveiled plans for a new center in western China.One avenue Khandpur is exploring is creating products with digital capabilities. He is hiring people with experience in electronics, software and mathematics to augment the company’s traditional strengths in materials sciences.Among the projects underway are work on developing sensors that can be embedded in cable splices to monitor power lines, and Khandpur envisions respirators that can track the wearer’s vital signs or detect if the device is being worn incorrectly.""It’s not about creating a software company in Minnesota,"" Khandpur said. ""Our thinking is our core products are intersecting with the digital world.""
